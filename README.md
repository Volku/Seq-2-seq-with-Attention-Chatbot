# Seq-2-seq-with-Attention-Chatbot
Project at Shibaura Intitute of Technology as a Research Exchange Student

This is the first python and deep learing project. This project use pytorch framework to create sequence-to-sequence model which is use to create a chatbot. I have tried many different way to create a chat bot by following the tutorial of pytorch. Since this is my first project about this field, I am not able to create it from scratch. The project is implemented by follow the pytorch chatbot tutorial. I change corpus of the tutorial to daily dialogue.
