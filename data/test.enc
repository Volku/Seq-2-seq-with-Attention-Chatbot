Hi.

But

She okay?

Great

He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.

I have to be home in twenty minutes.

Neat...

I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .

I guess I thought I was protecting you.

You looked beautiful last night, you know.

Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...

What if she never starts dating?

Daddy, I --

If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.

Oh, God.  It's starting.

Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?

I was kidding. People actually live there?

He always have that shit-eating grin?

No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...

You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.

Will Bogey get bent?

And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.

What've you got for me?

Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion".

Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.

Cameron -- do you like the girl?

She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote

Hey -- do you mind?

I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.

Nope - just came by to chat

What's this?

So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.

You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.

Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?

You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.

There's a way to get a guy's attention.

The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.

I say, do what you wanna do.

This is so patronizing.

Like you could find one

Why'd you let him get to you?

So what ' s up with your dad?  He a pain in the ass?

Good call.

So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?

Tell me something true.

No.

Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?

You tell me.

How'd you get a tux at the last minute?

Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.

Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?

This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?

Was that your sister?

Macbeth, right?

Say it

What plan?

I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.

Ever been to Club Skunk?

I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?

Have a great time, honey!

Did I have anything to say about it?

What are you listening to, chicken ass?

You can see for yourself.

I could be gone for years.

Are we going to argue?

She said yes.

Don Alonso de Bobadilla.

How far from here?

Father...

I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.

But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.

Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers...

You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.

What are you saying?

May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!

Don Moxica -- we all have to work.

Well... It's the men, Sir.  They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...

Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!

Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.

Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.

Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.

But it's...

I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.

Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.

That's what he did to me.  He put cigarettes out on me.

I can't take you to my place.

Did you ever turn tricks before?

I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.

What are you asking me?

You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?

If I was your boyfriend, I might be.

I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything.

Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.

I let her take a shower.

The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King!

How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.

Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?

Tomorrow.  At lunch.

Sorry...PD only.

I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...

Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.

Did you get a report from the M.E.?

If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?

I'll come with you.

I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.

Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.

Two heads.

Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig's.

You thirsty?

Yeah.

I'm serious here.

Yeah, just her in the shower.  Nothing happened.  Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...

Why'd you help me back there with the Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like that?

Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.

I kill someone famous.

Is it drug related?

Detective - can you tell us what happened here?

Eddie, are you okay?

Alright.

Alright.

Stop it.

No.  Tell me what you want to say.

Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.

Promise?

I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.

He's from Antigua.  His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party.  Stabbed her with a beer bottle.

Okay.  You work in a vodka factory.  I understand that.  And what kind of work do you do?

Now I like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure.  Why don'tchya put my money on the dresser.

Is he with you?  Are you travelling together?

We are both from Prague.

Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision.

How you erase this?

Gotta light the scene better.  Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN.

Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.

It's easy to learn.

We started over, you can too.

Well, he...

And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.

Well, he killed my partner!

Where you been, man?  We got a celebrity!

Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.

Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.

-- From Czechoslovakia?  And how long have they been livin' in your building?  Alright, I'll be in touch when we know somethin'.  Milos and Tamina Karlova.  They were quiet and kept to themselves.  Landlord don't know who your girl is.

How was it?

This had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who, as you know, made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor.

Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?

Hi. Frank... coming in, please.

Okay. 

Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.

Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.

It's about my salary cheques.

Really.

Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?

Yes, I thought so.

I suppose it isn't logically impossible.

You're kidding.

I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.

I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.

You probably also know that we found them okay.

Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history.

Is your confidence in me fully restored?

I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.

If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.

Are you coming to my party?

When are you coming home?

Oh, thank you very much.

I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.

Oh, that's such a delightful age.

Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.

Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.

Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.

Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.

When do we arrive at Clavius?

Thank you.

Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?

Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false.

Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?

Maybe you better have a Black Russian.

Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.

You're in a hurry.

Hello, again.

I hear you've got visitors.

You lying son of a bitch...

After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever...

Yeah?

This prison gives out $400 suits?

Yeah.

What do you think?

He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.

Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.

Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?

This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...

I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...

You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...

He's after your money.

What?

Doesn't it get... Tiring?

Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money...

What about Luther?

We missed.

They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the "Don't Disturb" sign.  He's trading his girl for the money.  All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind.

That was quick.

Hey, how'd my car get here?

Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend.  I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him...

What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit?  I mean, they could be in Rio de Janeiro.

Okay, reggie, start bustin' my chops... Tell me how great you were with that chick.

No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.

Hey, the bastard's got my gun.  I want it back.

Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...

Which one pulled the trigger?

What a screw-up.

Where the Christ do you think you're going?

That's what you say, Cates...

Who are all these?

Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?

Tell me that's not the same guy.

Doesn't look like it.

I almost forgot.  That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him.

Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't you tell me before?

Hey, you're right.

I'm all wet.

Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.

If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.

You know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put on a clean shirt in the morning.

Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day...

Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...

How do you know?

It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.

When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.

I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.

You're impossible...

Hey, two days with him is enough.

Stall.

Keep stallin'.

How ya doin'?

Surprise, Luther.

I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...

Come on, you can trust me. Please.

You sure?

How about some ammo?

Akta dedero ansila do mektet.

Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.

Who are you?

She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.

You're probably very angry with me and I quite understand. But I want you to know I'm fighting for a noble cause.

Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?

I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!

Do you love her?

I'm sorry, but... the Stones...

Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..

Akina delutan, nou-shan.

Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest...

Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?

The Fifth Element...

I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?

Yeah?

Hello?

...Ma???

Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..

Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...

Six to the left. One to the right.

I don't even know what I'm looking for!

Is that all?

You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'?

I'm not going.

...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back.

Valo massa... Chacha hamas.

Uh...

You're nothing but a... a...

I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.

Why?... Why would you need me?

...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react, to protect themselves. That means growing skin. Clever, eh?

Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!

My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.

Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications.

How's our deal coming along?

Welcome home.

Okay, I believe you.

You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?

Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...

Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone?

You're killing me...

What are these?

What are you talking about?

That's five thousand dollars.

You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it.  I'd like to take your picture.  You don't mind?

I'll do this for you.  Fifteen thousand dollars.

Where's that?

Alright, Tom.

For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.

They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.

It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.

I'm gonna kill you.

Don't ask questions.

I want his name.

Told him you could get him a snuff film.

Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.

I don't know.  I felt like it.  I never saw anyone get done before.

You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...

Do it.

As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.

You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself.

So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.

Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...

You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one...

You're making me very angry.

A man like Mr. Christian, a great man... all his money, all his power... a man who attained everything there was to attain...

It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.

What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?

I'm not a cop.

How much do you make now?

Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.

Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...

Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back.

You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.

Wha... ?

I know if I had to pick, it'd be "Choke," or "Devil."

Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?

He's odd.

There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...

I'm not positive this means anything.

Okay.

I didn't mean to...

I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time.  Maybe we can finish tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow...

It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...

Her belongings?

Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?

I heard you screaming.  Was it a bad one?

Here you are.  Where were you this morning?  Rick's looking all over for you.

I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad.

I know.  I hardly have any time to study.

Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.

No...

No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.

You don't really get it.  He's not a nightstalker.  It'll take more than bench presses to beat him.

Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't.

Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.

He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.

T-T-Thanks Alice...

Nice neighborhood.

What's wrong with me?

I'm sorry honey, but...

Honey, we went over this in therapy.

Feeling better now?

Excuse us, dear.

Who says I don't like you?

But how...?

Very funny.

You disappointed in me?

Alice!

No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.

Have you visited the little boy on my floor?  Jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?

Did everyone call everyone?

It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.

You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby?

I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you.  But, you're like a locked safe.  You've gotta start dealing with reality.

And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!

Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...

You do good work, Alice.

I thought about that.

No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?

Poor woman...

That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.

All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do.  I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...

Why don't you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?!

It's okay.

Wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, <u>Commander</u>!  It just so happens I'm <u>not</u> a coward - physical or mental - and before I'd risk my father's life...

That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!

Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!

You've asked why I stay a bachelor? There goes the best reason I know!

One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.

But <u>they're</u> not Skipper Neilsen's son!  It broke his heart.  Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father' - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy.  Oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish' - but it broke him, all the same.

Cyclops?

You've got to let us try, Skipper --

You all wait here.  I'm going inside, take a look.

What about down?

Course and speed?

We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air!

It doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?

All ready?

I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef -  You'll have to share quarters, this trip.

'Doctor' Neilsen?  When did <u>that</u> happen?

Determine extent of damage, immediately.

Right <u>at</u> him?

Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?

My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -

To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?

See what?

Due north.  At five knots...no, six!

Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks.

Are you alright, Wade?

You don't believe me?

The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news --

-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.

Chub says you're fired.

Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?

We bought you.

It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid.

They said.

This way.

I thought I told you to move that truck!

Like you and Gordon?

Aw, shit, she's here to get Jill. Me and Jill had a little argument. Jack, I got to get back, get back to town. Move this thing, will you? See if you can get back to the Town Hall before they get there, okay?

I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean?

Saw him do it?

Open the door. We're late.

Yeah.

Why do they do that?

Yeah. It's stupid.

I just think you used to be bad.

Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.

Jesus, why?

Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait for her by yourself. That's fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going downstairs.

Pop?

C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?

What do you want, then?

Tomorrow, Gordon.

Huh?

Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?

That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.

What the fuck. My day's already ruined.  Give me the keys. You can go back with Jack. You still got a shitload of plowing to do.

On what you pay me?

That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.

Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --

Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?

How's she doing?

I'm sorry about what I said.

About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?

I'm sorry.

No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.

I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...

Money.

You've been married twice --

Did you tell them?  That we were coming?

What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?

I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?

Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.

Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.

Who are you?

Something about my father?

Take care, Wade.

The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.

I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.

CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?

What was that?  You got something to say, say it! Say it!

Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?

You remember Margie Fogg?

How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.

Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?

Well, it was an accident.

Lillian was here. In Lawford.

Don't think about it. You're exhausted.

Haven't you already done a bit of that?

Find them everywhere. 

I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after.

It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.

I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it.

You don't want to say hi to your father?

You're right and I'll tell you a secret.  I know exactly how you feel.

Mom?

I don't drink coffee.

He didn't leave us.

How was...  ...the ballet?

It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.

The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet.

It's cut.

Who's flying the fucking plane?

Two and three are heading toward the Boeing.

Walter, if you have a point, make it.

They aren't answering their hails.

They still have the President, it's past their deadline and they haven't called. What do you think it means?

We've already been inspected.

The rest of the secret service?

Now, or he dies, please.

What do you know of my husband?

Do you have to be so brutal?

But they are not ny people. You look at me as if I am a monster, but answer me this -- when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces You will never see? Did You cry for their wives and children. They were people too, yes... but they were not your people.

Our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground. Our hands are completely tied while they're in the air.

Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100 hours. What you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades.

Get `em ready.  You... come with me.

I'll not going without my family.

May I speak to you for a moment?

I'll make it up to you, I promise.

White House switchboard. How may I direct your call.

who can I say is calling?

Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.

*                     CBS said they'll give us four minutes.  They thought the Russian was a nice touch.

It's bait.  Don't take it.

You give me ulcers.

Defense and State Department in the conference room in one hour.  I want to review the Iraq situation.

Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment.

IT'S OPEN!

Shut down accelerators.

Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.

That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.

Ted.

Elaine.

Elaine, I'm going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.

What will happen to him, Ted?

Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends!  You'll die out there.

Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications.

That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.

Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?

Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.

Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it.

Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?

Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.

You can't go in there!

You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker.

You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.

That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.

Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!

No.  I mean your relationship.

Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.

You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.

...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.

It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.

What did he have?

No. No one that I know of.

Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?

What's the matter?

Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember?

Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us.

You got a telegram from head­quarters today.

I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball!

Rain.

Good-bye, darling.

He's all over the place! Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet! What an asshole!

What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'

Oh, I can't stand it.

Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?

Oooh.  Hardball.  That sounds interesting.  Are you going to strike me?  You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me... I've got my own ropes.

You are Cassandra?

He's not here.  Why ask me?

You don't have squat.

Yes, I heard about poor Warren. Tragic.

What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.

Man, somebody really hung one on you!  I've heard some good ones for you guys... Humphrey Bogart, Harley Davidson.  I guess the people at immigration got a little punchy after a while, coming up with names for a quarter of a million of you. You weren't at the back of the line, were you, George?

Terrific.  A real pillar of the community.  Was Hubley missing anything when they found him?  Was he ripped off?

Get the picture?

A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.

Agree to work with me?  You don't like me... you don't like any of us. You have nothing but contempt for us.  And yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner...

How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?

So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she?

... and so, and so the doctor says, "If this is the thermometer, then where'd I leave the pen?"  You're not... you don't think that's funny?  George, work with me, I always get a laugh with that one. Look, if the doctor's got the thermometer in his hand, then where's his pen gotta be?

Your health...

There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other.

It's all right, George.  It's cool. Just wait here, all right?  I'll be back in a coupla minutes.

We?  You've taken it?

Shit!

No!  We must do this alone.

Harcourt is dead.

I never thought I'd say this, but -- for once in my life I think I'm willing to wait for back-up.

Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?

But there's no more drug.

You think this is the guy who did it?

To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.

Don't piss him off, O'Neal.  When he gets like this, I can't control him. I've seen this before.  He got like this once -- I saw him jerk a guy's spine out and show it to him. Nothing I could do.  I hadda go throw up.

One of the two men was Hubley, right?  What about the other one? Did you know him?

What kind of test?

Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station.

Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung.

I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis.  It seems to be metabolizing.  He should wake up soon.

Could it be intelligent?

You did okay, Bishop.

Have they located my daughter yet?

You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.

That's right.

If I go.

No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.

You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.

Look, we don't know what's going on out there.  It may just be a down transmitter.  But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor.  That's all.

What's he scanning for?

What's the question?

All right, the area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us.  First team head for operations. Hudson, see if you can get their CPU on line.  Hicks, meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower...

How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue?

Newt time then can walk right up and knock.

What's this?

Hicks, don't let him leave.

Oh, man.  And I was gettin' short, too!  Four more weeks and out. Now I'm gonna buy it on this fuckin' rock.  It ain't half fair, man!

It's inside the complex.

We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.

This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place...

And how are we today?

Casey.  She's my only friend.

Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.

Yes, there are, aren't there.

Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.

Don't go!  Please.

A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.

A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.

These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.

Why not?

Did you know? Had you heard?

The marriage!

No, she's fine.

Is she a good fuck?

No, no, no, no. You can't take him away now. This is his night. Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?

Hardly.

And how will you make him keep it?

Don Giovannnnnnnni!

I've come to dinnnnnner!

In the pot, I have got a good dinner. Not a sausage or stew, but a singer. Not a sausage or stew but a singer. Is the treat that I'll eat for my meat!

Why not?

That's stupid.

Oh, ha, ha, ha.

Yes, you are. You're very sick.

No, I'm not playing this game.

No!

Excuse me, Wolfi. Mama is not feeling very well. Can we leave now?

One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!

No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.

All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?

We'll have a little party. Come in. Come in. You know Herr Schikaneder?  This is! a very nice girl.

Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!

What?

Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.

Why not?

Frau Mozart?

Then he didn't send you?

I see.

Come back tonight.

Alone.

It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight.

Am I interrupting something?

I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?

He's adorable!

Hey!

Let us pass, please! Let us pass at once! We're with the Emperor.

Upstairs.

Well, I'm glad to hear that.

Good morning, Court Composer. This is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth.

An interesting idea, Majesty. But -

Why not?

And German?

Excuse me, but how old are you?

Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?

May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.

Ah-ha. Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?

She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me.

Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.

Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't spend any money on me.

Are you playing a trick on me?

Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving!

Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.

What did he say? What did he say?

Isn't he marvelous? He cost me a bundle, that horse, but he's worth it. I tell you, if you'd played Don Giovanni here it would have been a great success. I'm not joking. These people aren't fools. You could do something marvelous for them.

No.

Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Down there, damn you.  Welcome to you. Pay no attention, they're impossible. Stop it, you willful things! Come this way. Just ignore them. They're perfectly harmless, just willful. I treat them just like my own children.

Never mind, Strudel. It's part of music, getting used to an audience. Aren't I right, Herr Mozart?

Mio caro Adone.

I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.

Ah. Italian?

Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.

You burned the score?

How long will you give me?

Where is your wife?

I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that.

Who?

Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?

But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.

Do you believe in it?

The Fire.

And that's it. Do you have it?

I am so ashamed.

Oh? Have I seen it?

Exactly. A dance.

What are you doing, Herr Director?

What is this, Herr Chamberlain?

Who is on this committee?

Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!

My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?

Mozart -

So?

Leave me alone.

Are they?

All Vienna has heard that.

Do you hear me?

It was incomprehensible. What was God up to? Here I was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve God's gift and there was Mozart indulging his in all directions - even though engaged to be married! - and no rebuke at all! Was it possible I was being tested? Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense, no matter how painful? That was very possible. All the same, why him? Why use Mozart to teach me lessons in humility? My heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man. For the first time in my life I began to know really violent thoughts. I couldn't stop them.

No? Was Mozart a good man?

What anger?

Ballet? What ballet?

Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.

Oh yes, yes. And that was?

She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.

You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?

Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago.

Can I be of service, Miss Price?

What exactly did he call out?

Did he say a wolf?

It's a full moon. Where is he?

He's not?

Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.

David says Jack comes to warn him.

Surely you're not suggesting...

It was a wolf.

You haven't eaten your lunch.

Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?

Call me David.

Let's try a little harder, shall we?

I was. What are you reading?

What do you dream about?

Don't be silly. Can I get you something?

What?

Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.

Are you better now?

My friend Jack was just here.

Closet.

Let me go now, you'll make me late.

Alex, I've lost my mind. I woke up at the zoo! But you know what? I feel terrific!

Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?

David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.

Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.

Who is this girl?

Why are you doing this to me, Jack?

You've never had bad dreams before?

David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.

Jack.

Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?

It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.

Right.

Go on, ask them.

What the hell was that all about?

The Hound of the Baskervilles.

Nice doggie. Good boy.

Where are we going?

You really scared me, you shithead.

Thanks a lot.

So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.

What?!

If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead!

I'm not listening!

Shut up, you zombie!

What's wrong with you? Shut up!

You survived and now you shall continue the curse.

Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days.

What are you doing here?

I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.

What can I say, Jack?

Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?

Excuse me.  Yes?

Hello, there. What can I get you?

He may have a point, Lieutenant. Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man.

I don't rightly know, sir.

Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .

About twenty-four thousand.

Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie?

I remember once when your account checked.

When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.

Personally, I think you're getting panic-stricken about nothing. Dickson's all right.

Say, you know, I found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball. You've got to hit with the left hand, and from the inside out, it's the only way you can hit anything

Most of the creditors I know personally. I've seen them grow up in the community. I knew their fathers and mothers before them.

We want to talk to you.

I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr. Cluett.

Oh!

Fifty thousand dollars!

She wasn't to blame, Mr. Dickson. It wasn't her fault. Honest, it wasn't. I begged her to come up. She didn't

Good heavens, man! You're not suggesting that I

What do you mean?

What is the matter with you? You're trembling?

For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you .

Well, what?

You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.

What?

You know, there ought to be a Congressional Medal for men like you. America's comfort to misunderstood wives. I never thought I would find myself in that class.

I tell you, I'm not interested in your opinion.

Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything.  You'd do well to mind your own business.

Well, look who's here! Hello, dear.

Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it.

Yes, of course.

Ho! Ho! Ho!

I don't know.

In Mr. Sampson's office.

Come on in here, Helen. Bring your book. I want some numbers to try to get some action. Get Parker at the Union-Leeds - the Exchange . . . Winslow and old man Harris at the Home Mortgage. Snap into it, Helen. Just as quick as you can.

Helen!

Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke.

Got my letter?

Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?

You haven't got a uniform?

My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?

I already told him I was home.

You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?

Well . . . uh . . . I . . .

I want you both to take the day off. Go downtown and get a license and get married right away!

Good. I'll take this along with me. Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm sick and tired of the delay.

That's just exactly what he has been doing. This deal should have been closed weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .

The lobby's half filled now.

Yes, sir.

Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money here.

Absolutely.

No.

Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!

What happened? What did he say? Did you get the job?

Oh Matt, you must be mistaken.

Oh now, don't be silly.

Shh . . . !  I'll wait for you upstairs.

They must have turned him down.

Did you talk to him?

Dickson's in a jam I tell you. The run's getting worse.

Did you say Dude Finlay?

He was in the bank yesterday.

What did you find out, Mike?

Do you know this young man, Mrs. Halligan?

What time did Matt Brown get in?

Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?

That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.

We got a problem here, brother?

Corn gonna shoot at me?

Damn!

Okay, folks, I think we know how this is going to go...

He's planning a job.

Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...

'Bout time you got here, buddy.

Ride with me, cousin?

The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.

The James-Younger Gang.

Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper.

Beautiful.

And almost got hanged in peacetime.

Okay, you're gonna rest here.

Bob, rip up some bandages.

I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice.

You 'um big lawman?

What the --

Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.

-- rode right into them, screaming like a banshee.

Boys...

You know you're welcome any time!

Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.

So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.

She's still talking to Jesus.

-- if you stop saying things about my Zee.

And I planned getting you off the hangman's deck --

You've killed your fair share of men.

...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.

That he was.

Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.

Riders --

Jesse, are you awake?

Jesse, is that your hand?

I shouldn't tease a hero.

Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you, Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're everybody's hero.

Not if I find the right girl.

Little ones.

Tennessee?

Did you order our houses burned down?

How did you spot the ambush in Torrell?

Yes?

This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation.

Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth.

I like that.

You okay, Jesse?

Jim, you been with a girl yet?

Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?

Really?

Not at all.

How can that be?

There's only four of them...

Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir, it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field.

Really!

Just perfect.

You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity.

Every three months, the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty, Missouri. They always pull a job right before they return, probably to have extra money to give family and friends.

What the hell is that sound?

On a lot of lithium?

You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when?

Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.

I know. Stop it.

Are we here?

Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish." You'll love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely.

It's a plain end. I think.

Oh Jesus. I'm going home.

Will you call me before Thanksgiving?

Isn't that special?  Patrick?

I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time...

Nothing like last time, promise.

We should do it.

He's rich.

Your hairline looks like it's receding.

You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress .

Picked them up from the printers yesterday

Listen, what about dinner?

By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right?

What are you talking about? Bateman is what?

Patrick? Is that you?

Call me please, Patrick.

I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.

SHUT UP!

I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.

Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...

Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?

After six.

Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All right?

You don't like this, I take it?

Tell him I'm at lunch.

Yes, Patrick?

Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.

And don't tell me you enjoy working with children, okay?

Do you have a boyfriend?

Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.

Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie? Had you heard this?

Jean? What?

You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.

Yeah.

This tastes weird.  Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway you'd like. I'm at-

Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on. What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.

Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?

Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening.

Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just walked in...  Just joking...  No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John, right, got it.  Sorry about that.

Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything...  Not on "Page Six" at least.

Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own files, okay?

How old are you?

Bad habit.

Where did Paul hang out?

He had a yacht?

Don't you know this?

His girlfriend doesn't think so.

Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...

Nothing.

The earth just opens up and swallows people. 

Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.

What?

Well, I could he wrong.

Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.

No hash browns?

I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.

I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you.

Shhhh...it's okay.

How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?

Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break  Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.

Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.

How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit?

You are a fanatic.

When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest.

C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --

Go where? You can't get away from people like this.

Are you gonna tell me where you went?

Here we go.

Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.

Yes sir. I need to talk to you.

Milo?

And Outpost? You're happy there?

Conglomerates're lined up to finance the launch of the remaining satellites. They'll pay him a huge premium to get on-line.

We could move 'em up here.

It scales, don't you think?

No. I just went deeper into the machine. Preferred being the geek to having to explain. Lying would've been worse.

That's great! Thanks.

I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because of who you are.

Every entry was authorized.

Get the backslash, the colon, keys kids don't use but geeks do.  What would Milo want in here, anyway?

Now what are we doing? I don't get any of this shit!

I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.

The mainstream media. TV, or a newsmagazine.

Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."

Time?

We can't just assume they're standing by to receive Skywire 12 months from launch. I'd have to write in an aglet.

'Think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are?

Thank God.

Same with the excerpts I'm choosing: they'll play against any of the images you described.

Please don't go.

But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week.

Did you tell Alice?

I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.

So how'd you like the house?

Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites.

We tried the big vaporware number, Gary, it's no-sale.

Maybe he'll get back to work.

What is it?

There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual.

May I wash you?

In Japan, men come first and women come second.

How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?

Yes.

"Fifteen minutes of fame?" I'm going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that, either.

I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.

Thank you.

Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!

Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades?

Oh, and Austin...

Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence. Thank you for confirming the link between Dr. Evil and Virtucon. Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan. I'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately.

Yes?

Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.

Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.

Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger.

I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.

Have you ever made love to a Chigro?

Do I make you horny?

You've preserved my Jag! Smashing!

Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me!  Honestly, this isn't mine.

Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear.

A limousine has just pulled up.

Let's go get him!

I don't get it.

Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.

I hate having my picture taken.

Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell.

Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.

I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?

No, did you use a condom?

Hello, luv.

Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a rancid taste in my mouth. Do you have a piece of gum?

Who?

Everything seems to be in order.

Don't mind if I do.

But my design was perfect!  Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left.

Ow! You shot me!

I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have?

But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?

An evil petting zoo?

Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?

Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.

No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.

Come, everyone, let us repair to the main chamber. Project Vulcan is about to begin. Scott, are you coming?

Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.

Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?

I just don't see it.

And how do you feel about that?

We don't label people here, Scott.

I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.

As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.

Red ...

Knight ...

... death ...

Fear ...

I've come to apply for membership in Brolly --

I so agree. How did you acquire a taste for it?

You

Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell you everything ... The weather's getting worse and worse ... they're after me ... coming for me ... come quickly!

Quite right, but we still make the rules.

My number two. Special assignments. She's --

About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ...

A slight miscalculation -- my face was burned beyond recognition. Fortunately my research into plastics came in handy ...

Of course. I planned that, too.

Then what's stopping you?

I didn't. Mother did.

My father always wanted a boy.

That place is so absurd, so out of date ...

You know what I mean. This car -- and you. Nobody walks around like that. Milk?

Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?

No thanks.

The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.

So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How?

I wasn't about to.

But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style.

For you, Mrs. Peel.

Not quite. This is my field.

The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...

That's what we were working on.

Not that I know of.  Explanation?

Do you always drive this fast?

Yes ... ?

I told Mother I took care of you.

Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who?

Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...

Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?

When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.

They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel.

'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -'

Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel.

The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --

Steed

Think she really killed those agents?

I was hoping you could tell me.

I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?

Wonderland Weather Ltd.

Mrs. Peel -- ?

No, please! I beg you ...

John Steed.

Look at that guy. What a hunk.

He still thinks I'm going with him. I'm going to break the news to him tomorrow.

What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party?

What do you mean?

That's what we're going to find out...

Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.

I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?

All right!

And...

I don't want any trouble.

Great car.

Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be.

Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?

All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.

Cole, we've got to talk.

Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.

Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?

The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...

Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?

Um... that's very relaxing.

Remember, you promised... no screwing around.

I can't trust you!

Are you okay?

Ilene, are you crazy?

I'm using the same caterer for the shower I had for our Christmas party last year.

Ed, we're so glad you could come over at the last minute and judge our little beauty pageant.

So we want your best girls, the cream of your crop.

Your whores never showed up.

Let's go.

Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will.

Hookers beat you up?

I'm telling you I am, Joe.

I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch.

Is that all the coke in the place?

You want to share it?

What the hell are you doing?

You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?

Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.

Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience.

Where'd she go?

Where the hell is he?

How 'bout this?

He look familiar?

Guess who's here? Another surprise guest.

Debbie.

I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.

You always were sneaky, Stan, very sneaky.

Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's give him a break.

That's Franny. She likes firemen.

Biggest in two battalions.

-- What the hell's the matter with you? You always check the other side. I haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? We got a job here.

Did you do it for Tim?

-- Stephen, this is bullshit --

Doesn't work on you.  See ya around, little brother.

People actually used to pay you for this?

Why'd you come here, Brian?

Ya love it, probie?

C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...

Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I can get on the cover of LIFE magazine, too.

I had that fire. He didn't listen!

I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people!

How do you know?

You're his Lt., Stephen...  Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?

You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't you stay behind a desk where you belong?

Brian.

Thanks for calling.

Hey.

Hi.

Okay.

No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.

I was doing my job.

Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --

Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?

What is --

I'm sorry.

Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair?

You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard --

Who the fuck is doing this?

Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant.

-- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.

Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier

Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out.

No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point.

Nice bunch of guys.

So what do you want me to do?

Four months?

That's Sean? Jeez, he's a giant.

Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?

Oh, man, I'm sorry.

Every little boy's fantasy.

Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?

Completely out of control.

Aren't you even curious?

What?

Well, if it isn't the littlest McCaffrey.  Hey! You break anything with that you buy it!  Sorry, there must be something wrong with my eyes. I keep thinking that's a fire department uniform.

Uh huh. And "Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins". That was in your blood about six months wasn't it?

Fireman shit?

I hate it when we gotta fucking go look for it.

Stevie? Rimgale's here to see you.

Stephen, what are you doing here?

Where's Sean?

Sorry I hit Jackson.

Look, I'm sorry I --

Anyway, down here, take a look...

See that patch of shirt? We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here had ever heard of it.

Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.

I'm working on it.

You don't know... nobody knows...

Alderman Swayzak.

Brown Downtown... There hasn't been any smoking brown on the street in --

C'mere. You got some good blow, right?

First I'll put your Uptown in the spoon, then, to make it more exciting, I'm gonna add some Downtown. They call this thing a speedball, honey, but then you must know that...  First time shooting up?

Can you believe the nerve of this fucking guy? He kills people for fun, and then, he puts up 100 G to bring in some guys who raped a nun. What a sick fuck. Man...

I got it, man! I will find those kids. And I'll get the 50 G from the Church! Then the kids'll go to jail. I'll be in charge, of course. After a little while, I'll break the fuckers out -- and I'll turn them in to shithead I was just talking to. And pick up his 100 G. No. I'll hit him up for 200 G. Or 250 G. l can do it -- 'cause I've got the kids. Then, of course, there's the 180 G I'm gonna pick up on the Game tonight -- when the Strawberries win!

How come all those guys who're looking to get 50 from the Church haven't come up with shit? You got some kinda inside track?

You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again.

Are you all right, honey?

How are you doing, man?

There. Now you've got your profit and more. You'll have more product day after tomorrow, right?

I forgive you.

Large?

It's still my money. If you want to have a chance at any part of it, shithead, you will take my $120,000 and bet on tomorrow's game.

Oh, really?

Here's the deal: You meet me tonight across from the Garden. 33rd & 8th. At the beginning of the Ninth Inning. We'll listen to the end of the game together. You bring your cash, I'll bring mine.

I want 15 on the Mets.

He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?

I also thought of that bread, Father. And of that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died, and I kept the cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve God?

Those boys, those sad, raging boys... They came to me as the needy do. And like many of the needy, they were rude. Like all the needy, they took. And like all the needy, they needed.  Father. I knew them; They learn in our school. And play in our schoolyard. And they are good boys.

He gots to be did.

Everybody say Ho!

My name is Honeycutt and I want to try something different.  Can you do this for me?

My group we need some exposure. Was wondering if you could hook a brother up?

We're revolting against the powers that be, that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color.  And we won't stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the government of the U.S. of A.

Yeah, him.

That'swhatI'msayin'.  I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else.

And Big Black from Brooklyn, what do you do?

Life is beginning to look up.  It's all good in da neighborhood.

Seconds and thirds, too.

You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.

I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.

So that's what you been doing?

You're in this up till ya neck.

What about in the mean time?  Not the in between time?

Gentlemen, the show, our show will be satirical.  You know what that is, don't you?  Trust me on this one.

Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.

We ran out without my shoes and the floor.  I gotta get my stuff.  What about our savings?

That ain't funny.

I won't do it anymore.

I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.

No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?

But the line has to be drawn.

I understand Black culture.  I grew up around black people all my life. If the truth be told I probably know "niggers" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix.  Please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word.  I got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word.  I don't give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right.  Nigger is just a word.  If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I.

The middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave.  The middle class black family moves into a small Southern town that is run by the KKK.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black mother raises her teenage son.  And so on and so forth.  It's too clean, too antiseptic...

Delacroix, I'm glad you got your mind right.

Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer.  He has educated feet.

That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's off the hiz-hook!

I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.

That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?

I'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone.

I don't give a good goddamn about Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from.

This has to be a big mistake.

Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT.

I did.  I'm not an alcoholic.  I just like to drink.

The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.

Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.

Manray!

How did you know?

I'm in till the end.

Maybe something happened to them. Maybe they're lying in an alley bleed to death.

Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?

You've said that already.

The Jolly Nigger Bank.

Why'd you do that?

Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.

That's the way it came out.  Let me ask you one question.  Have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life?

What are you?  A man or a mouse? Are you a punk?  Punking out on me?

You've made it from the guttermost to the uppermost.  Don't you know you should never let them see you sweat.  Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?

It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show.

Richmond is not all the way down south.

Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.

How did you get this gig?

I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings.  Through the roof.  But in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead.  I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz.

Yes you!

You sing and dance?

Our guest tonight is the extraordinary, talented performer, Mantan.  Thanks for coming in.

Cousins, I want all of you to go to your windows.  Go to your windows and yell.  Yell, I'm tired of the drugs, the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents.  I'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks. I'm tired, you're tired, we're all tired of these so-called bible- thumping God fearing, whore mongling Professional athletes.  Aren't you tired of these basketball-dunking, football-running, hop-hip rapping ebonic-speaking sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different Ho's?  I know I am and so is Sleep 'N Eat.

Y'know my lady Lucindy?

Not her, the one with the little...

I heard ya lady is wild.

...perfect...

I fell out of my bed last night.

I don't know who I am.

Maybe you need to start.

I'll be down front.  You better start putting your face on.

You leave something out?

And?

Oh, you gonna make me say it.

Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will influence you.

Where's the beauty you promised me?

You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner.  When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on.

This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.

Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.

Good gracious!  What is this?

Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.

I have no luggage.

You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.

Who else can give me information about you?

But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost.

But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?

Never.

A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.

You want my heart?

The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.

I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away.

My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with me was a singular one.  Her life was passed in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me.  We would quarrel for a fortnight, then we should be friends for a month together sometimes.  One day, I was joking her, and asking her whether she would take the water again, whether she had found another lover, and so forth.  She suddenly burst out into tears, and, after a while, said to me:

Why are you shaking?

By name only.

Did you buy the horse, papa?

But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?

Your bother is in America fighting the rebels.

Yes, he's fine.

Sir William Cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches.  He was continually tinkered up by doctors, and, what with my usual luck, he might be restored to health and live I don't know how many years.  If Cosgrove would not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady?  But my fears were to prove groundless, for on that very night, patient nature would claim her account.

I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?

Don't like 'em, don't eat 'em, don't make no damn difference to me.

Hurricane kept you up, too?

Bill Styles...

Don't you ever point a gun at me!

Fuck, what the fuck is going on --

You framed-him...

Hey, I --  Holy fuck... holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?

What about you, wandering around alone? At least we have an alibi --

You too?

Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?

You saved Kendall's life --

We're not finished yet --

Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?

That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300.

He said he worked there --

What about the phosphorous grenade?

Is that what I did, now? And of course, you can prove all of it.

Cadet, what's your name!

You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?

What the fuck is going on?

Jesus, what happened?

Whose blood is that, Jay?

Mueller.

What happened to "degrees"?

Maybe I shouldn't tell you that. Maybe I should tell you I wasn't scared at all. But I was...  Enough to almost kill him.

I believe your next line is "What are you trying to hide?"

That bad?

This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne, the closest thing we have to an in- house investigator.

The exercise was one of his Section Eight "private sessions". Left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning.

Tom, bottom line: I let those kids go out there. If JAG shows up and I don't have any answers for them, my career is finished --

We've already been over the terrain twice. Nothing.

Nevertheless --

Yeah.

It's over. Time of death was 4:42. JAG's been notified and I called the Senator myself. My report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable... you two had no culpability in the matter.

You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike.

Gotta be honest, I love what you've done with the place --

Typical army brat story. Dad was noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was never any real doubt of joining up.

But we have to question him --  Thought you didn't have cigarettes --

"Too neat." How long have you been an investigator?

Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except Nunez. He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies -- he didn't see any crime committed.

Why do you care?

I didn't shoot West...

So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --

Buttfucks the cabin?

Are you sure?

You know, you never told me why you left the army.

We were close to something with Kendall.

We can tie you to the chair if it'll work better for you --

What if I don't want it?

Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.

A word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them.

Your phone number?

Pike, please --

Maybe we shouldn't go.

I remember now, it was before the explosion --

He couldn't kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own.

Nunez was chasing Dunbar.

Pike never confessed.

Pike never confessed.

It won't work --

Enjoy your flight to Washington --

We all know what you did, Pike. I don't know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here, but --

Tell him to shut up --

You think he did it?

You both know if you do this, if you go after a Senator's son and you're wrong... it's not just me in the hot seat anymore.

Then do it.

Bloom!

Well, she... uh...

I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.

Promise me you'll come back.

No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town.

Really.

Hi. How are you feeling?

Because see, my mother was banging the milkman.

He was buttering her rolls. Pumping her churn. Splashing milk in her box.

There was one time when I was eleven...

Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?

You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you? That's why they sent you here.

You know anyone's who's taken it?

I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens.

There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office.

You owe me three-fifty.

Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my own here. It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me.

What do you want, Will? Who do you want me to be?

Oh.

Daffodils?

How did you get so many?

It's me. Norther Winslow.

Oh. Oh.

I'm going to check on him.

I need you on my side.

Is that Dr. Bennett's car?

Mom, would you say you understand Dad?

I know it's not easy. Just remember, he didn't choose to be your father and you didn't choose to be his son. You just ended up together. You could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it'd be just the same. If you ask me, it's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all.

Is he awake?

Mom?

Did you and Dad have any other property?

I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.

You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.

A baby? What are we supposed to do with a baby?

What? What are you doing?

This is sensitive. Your car. Lovely car. Doesn't necessarily give the right impression.

You can see why it's sensitive?

How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?

You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.

I need to know who you are first please.

Hold on.

So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins?

She says she has a secret to tell.

How is bank?

I understand. I'm so sorry

Put the fucking kettle down.

He wants the money from your bank.

So. Is it different to how you imagined it?

Good. Or should I speak slower?

Uh... Are you a giraffe?

Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber.

So what are you going to do?

You must think... I'm the biggest pillock... In the world.

I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.

Give me some money.

No.

I don't hate you.

And who says what is wrong.

So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?

Some... What does that mean?

I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again.

What? I... I wasn't saying...

Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.

Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?

What happened between you and the blonde?

What?

I don't want anyone to die.

Okay. Thank you.

It's not mine.

Why?

You know the rules.  You do know the rules, don't you?

I'm standing most of my day. They're for support.  Didn't see you in church this mornin'.

Been eatin' like a princess all week. Even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo.

When? Now? Oh. No.

Hey.

Naw. They got some blue dye, though. You think them boots you got on come from a black cow?

For your hands?

Holy shit.

Sit down, man. Need a beer?

This don't feel right. Kitchen looks just like I left it. I know, cuz I cleaned it.

You gonna steal my truck?

It's not like I can't go out and have fun with my friends.

This thing you got... I've heard people say, you'd fuck a tree if it was handy. I can see that.  But that nigger Tehronne. Thinks he's some player cuz he hustles dope and stolen hubcaps. I mean, I can see a tree. But that piece of shit?

You wanna go home?

Better?

I'm not ready to grow old, Laz. Livin' with you. I feel it. Like I'm one foot in the dirt. Saw it happen to my momma. And that's not gonna happen to me. I got living to do.

Better than what you give.

My Daddy told me that a younger woman would bleed me dry. And that's what you did. Ya bled me.

Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I blow your face off.

GODDAMMIT, RAE!

SHUT UP! SHUT UP!

Mm-mm... Mm-mm...

Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.

Now, no harm's come to you... and I aim to keep it that way. Ain't gonna... gonna run a train over ya... or however you call it... see... you was runnin' wild on me... these fever dreams you was havin'... these fits. I'd be chasin' you all night.

I give ya enough chain so's you can get about the house. Get you to the kitchen. You need the bathroom, it'll reach.

We got everything we need. Plenty of food. Ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it...

Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...

Now that's sharp. That is sharp. Chain give you any trouble?

Want another?

Still makin' jokes?

I seen a man die. He couldn't breathe... his heart was... was givin' out.

Where you gonna be?

Are you drunk?  Keep drinkin' water and you won't get a headache in the mornin'.

I know that.

Go'on and sing it, I'll play.

Stop that foolishness. Just do as I say and close your eyes.  Close your eyes. And think about... well, for a song like this, I'd say you think about what you love.

Now that's sharp. That's real sharp. Miss Ella Mae set you up, didn't she? You like it?

You need some weed?

She got a spare minute she'll snatch up anyone... but me, I'm different. Sometimes she need the real deal, so she call me up. Girl got an itch. You know... what's a nigga to do?

She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction.

You ever seen a train run on a woman?

Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say...

Are you outta ya GODDAMN MIND?

A naked woman, chained in ya house?

You treat folks special when they company. It's just supper, R.L., shit.

Pass them potatoes, Lincoln.

Gotta get that chain off her, Laz. Somethin' like this gets out, you could land in a heap of trouble.

You won't at the square this mornin'.

You a preacher?

I think if I just piss... I'll be okay.

I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.

Well. That's my vomit. I came in here to get sick. I thought I'd make the toilet but... anyway, I got sick.

I'm a what?

Ain't been a week and you already some nigger's whore? Gill told me. Told me how you and he... you and everybody...

You got any money?

Alright. How much you need, ho?

Wait up.  You know the guy who did the Weismuller through the window --

Frank Abolofia.

What are you doing?

What'd you say?

Nick, have I been a good partner?

I worked the three nine in Queens, Charlie.

This should be it...

Getting very weird.

Now that's the kind of motorcycle I want to see you on.

You'll take care of that.

Are you expecting anyone?

Nick, no one's seen Kobo in three days.  He might not even be in Tokyo.

You said you could keep up with her! 'No problem, Nick-san.'

Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous...

She disappeared... shit!

I'm not drunk...

Nick!

It's very small.

No...

Just one, compadre... Kampai.

You know, Nick, we can't lose.

Think we'll get him, Nick?

Dead gaiijin's are big news.

Look, you need Ich.  I've been here five years and I still can't read all the street signs.

She ever pull down her shades?

And I'm supposed to care?

They want your autograph.

Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.

This is my stop.

One guy do all the damage?

You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight.

You lost a man we wanted for some time.  It was very incompetent on your part, officer.

While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.

-- Do you know where she is, detective?  Do you know how to find her?  Even where to start?  We will find them.

I took Kobo from the street.  I gave him a home, a future... But my ways were too slow for him... I served seven years in prison for my boss when I was a young man.  Kobo wouldn't serve seven minutes for his Oyabun.  He was supposed to take over this syndicate when I retired.

We're not used to the big city. Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost.

Let's go while there is still time.

And what can he do for you?

I want more life, fucker.

How about breakfast, I was just going to make some.

I'd be happy to mention it to him.

When?

I was just about to have my dinner.

She was gonna get away.

Look, go home.  Get some rest. Take an aspirin.

Well, when do you get paid?

When might that be?

You equipped for random questions?

How do I stop one?

Here's something you might find interesting.  They have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum. However, after a period of time it is only logical that such a 'mechanism' would create its own emotional responses, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.

Not if it works.

Next.

Number three.

I think I have no money.

But I would like to buy you drink.

Prosit.

You want to see my friends?

How long you had these guys?

You like to kiss her goodbye.

My birthday is April 10, 2015. How long do I live?

Money?

Love is just another name for sex. Love is sexy and sex is lovely -- I don't care what you call it, an android can't have it.

Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.

What if you change your mind?

Taffey Lewis?

I'd like  you to take a look at these pictures.

Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.

There's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place.

It's a good job.

The best.

You become pregnant by a man who runs off with your best friend, and you decide to get an abortion.

Is there anything else?

Two of us might be more effective than one.

How come you're not on the job?

What do people do in the afternoon?

Do you dream?

I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something more to it.

They could clean around the arrangement.

Have you ever known anybody a long time?

Ten years.

Do you think I simulated what happened between us?

Where the hell you been?

Bad?

Is this to be an empathy test?

Know what a turtle is?

Same thing.

Where are your folks?

Whatcha doin'?

My glands.  They grow old too fast.

Oh, now, that's a great one!

This is my new friend...

Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.

My office.

Please excuse this interruption.

Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to defend myself.

Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.

Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?

Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing.

So far?

I'm sorry!  I said something wrong, didn't I!  Please forgive me!

Rogers Hornsby's worth like four thousand dollars!

So...Mister Andretti, your first time on the freeway?

Wait!  Wait!

Wait, Eve, please!  Wait.

See, ya.

...Okay.

What's fair?

You got it! Wait here while I change.

Wait! Wait!

We'll have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry.

Thank you.

Bites what?

They're all divorced?

Yes!

I thought only hookers drank those things.

You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!

In the house?

Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.

No it's not!

Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!

What about her?

Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.

Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.

You wanted to see me!

Eve?!

I'm really sorry!

I know...and I'm really sorry.

Adam...dumb question, but humor me. Have you ever had sex before?

Uh-huh. Adam?

Really?  Okay!

Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron. It's the best thing.  The best thing for you. I promise.

Is that a birthday cake?!

Are you all right?

All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my father!

How do I leave here?

Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.

Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!

Like a painting?

Because he's forced out at third! It's a force!

Well, do we just go on up?!

Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...

Uh-huh.

You're sure?

That's what everybody believes?

You have very nice ceilings.

I love Lucy!

When did we get it from them?

I don't think so.

Not on him.

Why did you park way back there?

Twenty-five? Around there.

The sky?  Where?

Say what?!

Oh, that would be wonderful!

Oh, Adam,that would be wonderful if you could find a girl. One who's not a mutant...and hopefully comes from Pasadena. Nothing against Valley girls, but in my day anyhow, the girls from Pasadena, I don't know...always just seemed a little nicer.

Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.

No.

No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!

Yes, I can tell that just looking around.  "Boy?"  Did you say you were a "country boy?"

Really?

Well, put it down and come in!

I'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, I think it's prudent that we cut the evening short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the meantime...I'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance!

How long will we have to stay down here?

Days??

Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.

Home sweet home!

What's that noise?

To go up.

Hi, honey! Feeling better?

Uh, oh. Now it's time.

Why?

Not bad for a three and a half year old! I'd like to see the public school system match that! I don't care how terrific it is!

Get the presents and do the lights.

No kidding.  Who else would have done it?

If we still have one.

In the generator room again?

How long will you set it for this time?

Well, please excuse us!  We...we haven't entertained a guest in...um...

You came back for these?

I don't know.

That water's freezing!

Where are you going?

Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.

Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think?!

Oh, no!

Good God...you don't think there really is a bomb shelter, do you?

What do you want to do with it?

What's wrong?

Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?

I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.

Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. Goddam!!!  This is the suavest guy I know. Look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. Shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. This beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. It makes me puke.

Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.

Are you Detective Williams?

My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?

He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. There behind Vista, I found an ear.

I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business.

Is that why you say it's horrible?

Jeffrey! Come on in.

Not yet.

Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.

That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?

NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.

Do you like talk like that?

Thank you. honey.

Do you like me?

I made it go down the toilet.

No.

Nice guy. Who's he?

Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.

Falling.

I want you to hurt me.

You like to open me, don't you?

Shut up.

I'm glad you do.

Dorothy. No!

I'll call you.

Look at these. What are these?

Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.

Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.

What?

Thanks a lot, Mom.

I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.

Sandy?... Sandy, please.

Good to see you, son.

How ya doin' Dad?

Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?

You really do hear a lot, don't you?

What happened to him?

I've gotta go in.

I guess I'll see you sometime.

You hungry or thirsty, or both?

I'd like to talk to you about something.

Alright, now tell me. What is it?

You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.

I already know. The "Slow Club". It's on Route 7.

What's the plan.

Wow. Should you tell my father?

You were late.

You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.

Oh yeah?

Great. Hey, I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble.

What was that all about?

It's okay.

Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?

You want to dance?

Sandy?

Look Jeffrey.

Come on out a minute, okay?

Fuck you.

Paraffin came up positive. And bullet holes are usually a big clue.

What the fuck are you doing here? What, huh!? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? ANSWERS! I WANT FUCKIN' ANSWERS!

Anybody you think is evil?

Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?

Climb the corporate ladder, boy. Don Rocco.

No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it?

Look again for fuck sake!

You little fuck. Let him go. I'll drop you right here.

I finally found your Da's army revolver, Connor.

Well, the light caught the side of his face for a second. And it looked like he had a gray beard, maybe... late fifties, early sixties.

No fuckin' hot water man. That...

Where the fuck are you going?

That was way easier than I thought.

Nine bodies.

Mafiosos getting caught with 20 kilos and walkin' on bail the same day.

Who did you kill?

So what do you think?

Give the guy a shot.

There he goes.  Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to bring this man into the light? Are we ready to truly do the work of the Lord?

Now, you will receive us.

It is your evil, who will be sought by us.

Yeah?

Your what?! Your fuckin' what?!

So Duffy, got any theories to go with that... tie.

Allow me to enlighten you gentlemen to the protocol of the porno industry, as I'm sure you've never been in one of these places before. A man goes into the booth, puts the money in the slot. The dancer gets it on the other side. She hits the button, door goes up, now there is only glass between you and it's  little fireman time.

That's one big fuckin' shoe!... and think about it. Of all the ways to kill a guy, crushin' him to death. That's very particular. You don't get many of those. I dunno. I feel something big here. I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of these turning up.

Who the...

Oh, she's quite proud of herself.

It's only 11:00 here boys so I got lot's more drinkin' ta do with your worthless relatives down at the Anvil.

Right now.

This is some heavy shit. This is like Lone Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it! There's so much shit that pisses me off. You guys should recruit 'cause I am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin' down the street waitin' for one of these assholes to get me, y'know?

Hello?

Roc. You okay?

No. You sure you're okay?

Hurry the fuck up!

Vincenzo, that fat motherfucker, Yakavetta's right hand. He's the one who set me up. Then he went around shooting his mouth off, telling everyone I was as good as dead. He goes in there every Wednesday night around 10:00, he jerks off in the same booth to the same titty dancer. Never misses.

Well, truth be known, those first ones just kinda fell into our laps.

But in this day and age I believe what they do is... necessary. I feel it is... correct.

I want to stand for what I believe in, father.

I believe these young men are right.

Yes.

You gonna do what I say, got it?

I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me!

Don't do this my son.

Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?

Continue the joke.

Making Hutch David Soul?

Plus where's Huggie Bear?

Now that window can never be locked. It's impossible.

She's really kind of hot.

It's got a V-8, Dignan.

That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.

Holy shit. What'd I tell you?

But he didn't say anything.

OK. Escape route. The most important thing you can have is an escape route. Just in case somebody's tailing us. Or even chasing us, as the case may be --

There's another stocker, right?

Is that the manager?

Holy shit.

What about what that guy said?

Can I get that credit card from you?

Well, then cut it in half.

I'll just say it.

You owe me fifty bucks.

May I have a word with you, please?

She's from Cuba.

He needs to hire an attorney.

But if it wasn't for Dignan I probably would of died.

He told you and you let him do it.

If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?

If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now. Of course I'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped.

We're going over to this bar if you feel like going.

I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and --

She doesn't need to know.

Our money situation is not good.

Mr. Henry has an inside source. We call him Steve. That's where we get our information.

You could give somebody a concussion.

No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.

Next week we'll be drinking piña coladas.

Yeah. As a girl.

We all set?

What's happening? What's going on?

Where's Kumar?

Dignan, it's too late.

Does it float?

No. I'm not.

It's hard to get much spin with this kind of paddle.

You know, your form is for shit, but you've got a hell of a talent.

Every once in a while some cat comes to me. He wants to know how I made it. How did I become a success?  The first thing I tell them is: follow your instincts. Let your instincts guide you. The second thing I tell them is, for Christ's sake: you got to know your grammar.

I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?

That was a test?

How does that feel?

This is good.

But you're thieves. It's what you are.

Are you serious?

Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.

Anthony, I --

What?

Why not?

At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. That's partly why I was in custody so long. Sixty days.

No, I know. I'm just saying. I feel fine. You want a piece of cake?

What are you doing?

Let me see it.  Did you drop it?

Jesus, Bob.

Yeah.

Did you ever hear of the S. Cooper Trust robbery?

Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.

Where'd they come from?

I don't know why the fuck we're having a party. The damn job's not over yet.

No.

He looks like he was designed by scientists. For desert warfare.

OK, Bob.

If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?

What did I say?

The guy is fucking insane.

Where'd she go?

What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!

What happened?

This is natural.

Did we get it?

In all probability nothing would of happened. But why take the chance? That's why I ran. I mean how many plants were even back there? Five? Ten?

Is he chasing us?

What do you mean get back?

This could be a trap.

Give me the keys, Dignan.

Future Man would never go to jail for you, I'll tell you that.

Yes, I do.

It's not your decision and he's not your brother, Dignan.

Come on in. What you been up to?

It's too bad about what happened on the road.

Right. It was extremely stupid.

Come on!

Do you have your own room?

How's that 700 bucks coming?

Fancy seeing you here, Bob.

You got to have fun with it. There's no point if you're not having any fun. Would you like me to be there tomorrow?

Where did he go?

Why did he go that way? 

Where is he? Where is Rob?

You like Chicanos?

Guess I'll get another Tecate.

Fuck you. You a Hoto.

Come on in!

No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse.

Go to the airport. Get a plane. I'll have a brass band waiting for you.

Treadstone.

To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.

Oh, God... It must have been Bourne.

Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...

There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know.

Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?

Show me again...

That's not what happened to your parents.

They loved you.  And I killed them.

What do you want?

What's going on in Berlin?

-- what? --

-- it hasn't been two years --

But we were so careful.

So...

That's crazy.

...but you're not -- you're not sure...

-- it's just him? --

A Russian?

You didn't answer my question.

-- who? -- who else is here? --

How long have you worked for the agency?

I want that area secured, I want any evidence secured and I want it done now. Is that clear??

Good luck.

Believed what?

So he fooled you.

Did you?

Some women like Dobermans --

Black coat, possibly leather. Dark slacks. Dark t-shirt.  He says they're gonna try and corral the guests on the street over there, and then check them out, but...

His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself. 

We're looking at all Berlin outbound. Good news is, every train station in Berlin has thirty to forty fixed, digital security cameras. Common feed.

What are they doing?

Peace?!

A wise plan. And how is your father? We have missed him at the council.

Nor you. To you that word is as unfamiliar as love.

You know it's a trap.

Keep these. We're going too.

They're English soldiers, ain't they?

Test of manhood.

Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.

I am the one who is rotting. But I think your face looks graver than mine.

So more men were slaughtered uselessly!

Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --

-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!

I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like this one.

Tonight then.

Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.

I am the Princess of Wales.

Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?

I understand you have suffered. I know... about your woman.

Who would do such a thing?

What?

And you say he doesn't remember any of it?

Anything.

Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.

It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.

Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy.

We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.

I... I blacked out.

Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?

And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...

Best not bitch up. Wind up someone's luggage that way.

Just tell me if anything weird happens.

Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet you.  He's as handsome as his father.

Where are you now?

The car doesn't vanish Evan. The movie in your head has broken, that's all. But now I've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car.

It's a little complicated. I haven't seen results exactly like these before.

Think Evan. You've invented a disease that doesn't exist. Alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia...

You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.

Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.

It's an experiment with flatworms and a maze. You take a flatworm and run it through the maze until he's memorized it. Then you put a new flatworm in the maze. He's clueless. Banging into walls, getting lost, whatever.

Whasamatter? Lost your Rolex?

I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, right?

God, Evan! I never thought I'd see you again. How've you been?

So how's Tommy?

Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?

Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.

Jesus, Kayleigh, you're...  Incredible.

Hey, uh, don't go freaking out on me over this, but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera?

Why are you doing all this for me?

Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare you away from me.

It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?

Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him!

Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?

What's happened to you?

On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.

Oh? There's proof now?

Off to change everyone's life again, is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act.

I was?

What time is it?

What's happened to -- How are you doing that?

It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?

So what's the point?

What?

Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on!

What the hell are you doing?

Mom. Don't cry. I can change this.

Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.

Lenny? Come on!

You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it.

Here you go, buddy.

I should have known.

No, of course not. Do you mind if I do?

He did. Captain Renault did.

So you decided to go to America.

Does he know that?

You want my advice?

Such a bargain. But that is your decision?

Now you finish locking up, will you, Carl?

-- Don't tell me where you're going.

Goodnight.

Er, goodbye, sir.

Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.

It was gracious of you to share it with me. Good day, Mademoiselle, Monsieur.

And Mademoiselle?

Mademoiselle, after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.

It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.

Not an easy day to forget.

Say goodnight to Sam for me.

I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.

Yes?

Ten years ago? Let's see...  ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?

Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.

I didn't count the days.

I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night.

Why did you come back? To tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station?

Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?

You use "Richard" again? We're back in Paris.

Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.

No. Oh, Richard, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but, but you, you are our last hope. If you don't help us, Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.

Oh, you'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out? Then he'll have his work, all that he's been living for.

Richard, Victor thinks I'm leaving with him. Haven't you told him?

But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?

I don't understand. What about you?

Hello, Sam.

Does he always leave so early?

No, Ilsa, I won't let you stay here. You must get to America. And believe me, somehow I will get out and join you.

Our faithful friend is still there.

Yes?

Ask me?

Captain, the boy who is playing the piano, somewhere I have seen him.

Yes.

Hello, Rick.

How do you do?

Good morning.

Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to say.

Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?

I know a good deal more about you than you suspect. I know, for instance, that you are in love with a woman. It is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman. The first evening I came here in this cafe, I knew there was something between you and Ilsa. Since no one is to blame, I, I demand no explanation. I ask only one thing. You won't give me the letters of transit. All right. But I want my wife to be safe. I ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca.

Monsieur Blaine, I don't know how to thank you.

But we made a deal.

No. It's all arranged.

Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to explain anything.

Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.

I am delighted to see you both. Did you have a good night's rest?

That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.

And the honor of having served the Third Reich.

By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.

This is hardly the time or the place.

You will give us the names?

For the time being.

Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.

Especially so tonight, Major. In a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers.

Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.

Ho, diplomatist!

You see, Major, you have nothing to worry about Rick.

Mademoiselle.

Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him stay.

Hello, Louis.

You know, I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne, maybe get her on the rebound, eh?

How observant you are. As a matter of fact, I wanted to give you a word of advice.

Victor Laszlo.

Oh, but I just told you. --

Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official.

I think not. I have seen the lady. And if he did not leave her in Marseilles, or in Oran, he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.

It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.

The winning side would have paid you much better.

I have my orders.

Oh, no, Rick never --

Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.

Well I was right. You are a sentimentalist.

Will I see you tonight?

Come on, we're going to get your coat.

Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too.

You'll excuse me, gentlemen. Your business is politics. Mine is running a saloon.

Well, Rick, after tonight I'll be through with the whole business, and I am leaving finally this Casablanca.

One moment. Tonight I'll be selling those for more money than even I have ever dreamed of, and then, addio Casablanca! You know, Rick, I have many friends in Casablanca, but somehow, just because you despise me you're the only one I trust. Will you keep these for me? Please.

He'll double what I pay you.

You ever going to bed?

We'll take the car and drive all night. We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing and stay away until she's gone.

What's that you're playing?

Where is she? Have you seen her?

Thirsty.

No more water, you said.

No.

You're beautiful.  Marry me.

It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.

Well, I have to say, I'm impressed.  You never gave up.

You know what happened to this?

To tell you the truth -- you did.

No.  that was the last one.

Keep painting.  Promise me.

What brings you out to the sticks?

Your eyes are puffy.  Did you take Valium again?

Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?

Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.

You know, for when you travel.

Look, I love the puppy.  I love you.  But I have to go.

I didn't want to.  It just happened.  One day Gary was there.  He took care of everything.  He took care of me.  I was a mess.

Her name's Hannah.

I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals.

I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg.

My favorite doctor.  What's the verdict?

Which I didn't have.

If you say you are.

I used to drive one of those.  A long time ago.

You're Chuck Noland.

Really?

Maybe I should take a few days off. Roger's working now, you could use some help around here...

When'd you start working here?

What a journey you've had.  It seems more than a person should have to bear.

Okay.  After three years the PTR reverts to tape storage, which is okay because we access it through the CPC.  Here it is.  Ten packages from the same sender.  Baku. Delhi.  St. Petersburg.  The guy was a real road warrior.  This package was Kuala Lampur.  No activity in his account after this package.  No forwarding addresses after K.L.

You what?

I'm from Arkansas.  Tell me a story with Robert E. Lee in it and maybe I'll pay attention.

God damn!  God damn!  Chuck, it's you!

I beat the odds!

How about we go somewhere else?

Must have taken a hell of a long time.

Not just that.  Take your time.  Use it. Live it.

It's not ergot, it's not pituitary extract, it's not oil of rue...

I was dreaming about you. How beautiful you were!

Then I wasn't beautiful.

They want to replace me! The Board of Trustees wants to *replace* me!

These *credentials* are against the law!

He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!

Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.

Homer, you know I would never kill anyone--you know I wouldn't.

Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?

Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.

So, Mrs...

How many months are you?

I've never seen a lobster.

A movie *outside*?

People watched the movies in their cars?

How could you not *care* about the movie?

That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.

I *know* this was right.

Olive told me.  You might have told me yourself.

No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do.

We should take her to St. Cloud's. That much is obvious, isn't it? Let her make up her mind when she gets there...

Hi...

You ain't been through what I been through, Candy.

You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's not Jack, is it? It's *Muddy*! Is it Muddy?

So many children. Are they all orphans?

There! You said it was boring.

I love you, Wally.

I was just showing Homer the orchards... kind of a geography lesson.

Nobody special enough, Curly.

So here is my candidate. What do you think?

Uh... it's the end of October.

Has anyone offered you anything to eat?

I wonder if you might give me a ride.

No, I'm not. I need a job.

It's almost like flying.

Uh... I'm shipping out sooner than I thought. I just wanted to be sure you were settled in--and happy enough, considering...  Are you bored stiff? Or can you stick it out for a bit?

It's big enough to keep you out of the war, I suppose. Ain't that right?

Are we supposed to be up here? The rules said...

I didn't see where you was pickin' this mornin', Homer, but you musta worked up a big appetite. You look like you're serious about gettin' to your lunch today!

I think you been stayin' up too late at night, Homer.

Homer, don't you know what business you in? You don't wanna go into no business with me, Homer--ain't that right?

What's that? What's it called?

First pregnancy?

It's obviously an aborticide.

Fuzzy is not uncommon. I tell you, there's something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers. They seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along.

I haven't, either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*.

Okay, he's just a Wilbur then.

In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.

You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I hope.

But you don't look very happy.

Shit. We don't know what he is.

It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'.

I fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissed--that part of the world requires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here.

I fail to see how a little Christianity could *hurt* anyone here!

You all take care of yourself, too, Homer!

You pickin' nothin' but cider apples, Peaches--I hope you understand that.

Where's your manners? Make room for Homer, so's he can enjoy the view.

I told him that you all is sick.

That what happen--you lost you only daughter so's you killed yourself! That's what we say, all right.

That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer.

Where do you think you're going?

That Candy--she's the nicest girl I know!

You're lucky he didn't cut your *nipples* off, man.

You ever see a palm tree, Homer?

But I'm not that late. You didn't have to give away my seat.

Oh. Well, thanks for the drink.

Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --

Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works. So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times the initial loan.

Same thing with playing a con. You have to be able to see that deep.

Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to play the Inside?

And I think it's because of this redhead...

Grifters...

It's all about the money, isn't it?

So how'd you get caught?

Is that what it was, Jake? Was it love?

So much for honor among thieves. You would have cut loose your friends, your girl...

We were back on.

Alright... Turn around. She doesn't get shit, unless I get that money. Where is it?

Like putting on a play... Guess some people forgot their lines.

Not that I recall. What do you want us to do about it?

We'll take care of it.

Currently, the King Pin is a very large-type pole stuck up our asses.

Whoa. What?

This might just be me, but that is hands down, the dumbest fucking idea I've ever heard.

Poor bastard never knew what hit him. Jesus, I almost felt sorry for the guy.

Seems Lionel Dolby came down with a sudden case of drowning last night. They just pulled him out of the East River.

You know what we're doing with the money.

She got one leg out from under him. Now we had to lean.

We're going to make it back, Grant. Three or four times over.

Minus one.

Honest mistake. Just give me the money back and all will be forgiven.

Why not?

Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...

What do you need from me? Permission? Go! If you can fleece him for two million, then do it, Kid.

Look at you, you skinny prick.

Don't get me wrong, Jake. I like you boys. You guys are the steadiest business in town. But what can I say? Twenty percent's still better than what we give to any of the other criminals.

Sorry, I --

Of course. Jake. Nice to see you.

Take it from me, you never do. But congratulations. Nice to be married, isn't it?

Thank you, sir. You know, I hope this isn't too much of an inconvenience, but if Carolyn is coming down for the weekend, perhaps I could give you something for her? It's a check. We split the cost on a few books and I haven't had the chance to pay her back yet. Could you..?

What about... The money?

You need to get a haircut.

I don't trust anyone.

I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option.

It's more than that.

Who says you have to know the King to be in a hole? I actually did have a real job once. When I was in high school, I worked as a candy striper.

Shit, what was that guy's name? I really liked him.

Jesus... Take it easy.

What about...

What do you get, Lily? Finder's Fee? Because it is all about the money, right?

You better hurry. The police will be here any second.  I don't really understand my motivation with this. Why am I washing glasses?

Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?

Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.

Him.

Feeling lucky today, Miles. Found a penny -- Heads up. There was an empty cab right outside my building. We hit every green light.

Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?

When this is all over, you're going to tell me who the King put on Al.

And like in a game of chess, you've played every possible move in your head...

Aces, Suits.

Can I speak to you in confidence?

Try and keep up... You ask for the Advantage Goods, then you guys come in looking to be Bean Traps. So I gotta think you're either working the mace or playing the Jug Mob.

Can't say.

So what do you want?

If you Feds are so hot for him, why don't we just bring him in right now?

You guys awake?

He's headed towards the eastern most exit. Do not, under any circumstances approach. I want to follow this all the way down to Vig.

Hope so. Those fucking orthodontist bills are killing me. One fifty every time they tighten those bitches up. One fifty! It's not even covered.

My car's in the garage.

I hate cheats.

I got scared.

I've been watching you work. You're the best in the place. But you know that.

The Indian rope-trick.

You fucking little shit! You shopped me.

How about fifteen hundred?

Eight-fifty.

She went back to South Africa.

Right.  Look, I must get back to Habib.

Jack, look, next weekend I'm having a house party. Here...  It's near Oxford. Why don't you come? It'll just be social. No business.  Bring a friend. I've plenty of room.

A bit unexpected, wasn't it?

Take it back. Till you sell your book.

I loved it blond.

Are you drunk?

What are you doing here?  You know the rules.

Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and --

The door, Jack.

It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.

No.

For Christ's sake, Jacko, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Have you written that name down? Reynolds, at the Golden Lion. 

I'm sorry, madam, we don't accept gratuities in the UK. It's different in South Africa.

It's against the rules. Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters.

To coincidence.

Near the casino.

I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off.  I must go. Let me pay for this.

He doesn't gamble.

I didn't.

But if it does.

I want you to forget what I said.

How much do you owe?

Hello...

Jani! Where are you?

I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?

Don't worry, I won't report you!

David Reynolds, I'm the Manager here. Sit down, John.

You've been recommended by the management here. They know your father. He has a bit of a reputation, hasn't he?

In any case, I understand you've had some previous experience... in South Africa.  You'll find the rules a little different here. Before we start, you haven't got a police record, have you?

Where did you go to school?

There are three types of casino in the U.K. High volume. Small faction. And MOTR. That's middle of the road. Us.

25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.

You use two alternating, don't you?

I make it six.

We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.

You can start Monday week.

Mr Tchai always likes to play at that table, and only with Bella.

Thanks for the information.

I'm getting this flickering light on one of my panels.

There she is. Definite 99%-plus probability that the planet is going to deviate from its normal orbit in another twelve thousand rotations. It'll spiral in toward its sun, and --

No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!

It didn't go off.

Find me something, I don't care where it is.

Quantum is up thirty-five.

Rechannel all safety relays --

Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?

False data can act only as a distraction. Therefore. I shall refuse to perceive you.

Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?

Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.

Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.

Yeah. Eight, it says here.

What are you gonna name it?

-- open circuit breakers --

I really think I should try and locate it immediately. Might be something important.

Doolittle! Help me.

Commander, sir, we have a big problem. You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck. It won't drop from the bomb bay. It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in --  -- less than eleven minutes.

Commander Powell? Commander, hello!

Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.

Who are you?

But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.

You're attractive, you're smart.  Stand on your own two feet, know what I mean? And you got a wicked sense of humor. Man, you really zinged the boss a couple times, it was all I could do--

Man, you got a bad attitude.

Who's Camille?

Move it.

How're ya doin', Max.

I was crazy about you...am crazy about you.  But you keep everyone at arm's length like there's some great big dark something going on that-- I don't know... It's just that the more I tried to get close to you, the more you pulled away.

Lemme put some clothes on.

But I'm afraid of--

Which is none of your business...or mine.

What're you lookin' at me for?  I'm not his next of kin.  Anyway, I don't got that kind of cash lyin' around.

What're you looking for?

You're light a deuce.

So Max, what do you do with all your money?

He's a mistake I made about six months before you did.  But don't feel bad. Justine made the same mistake, along with Renee, Jada, Tia, Brooke--

What a creep.

You didn't...

I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends--

What makes you cry?

Soon, baby.

I'm sorry if I caught you at a bad time.

Who is...

So this guy walks into a bar and says...

Lemme get my coat.

How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?

Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.

You got a lotta nerve.

L-Triptophane...a neurotransmitter sometimes used in homeopathy to control seizures.  Then the lightbulb went off.

We got separated right away.  I never knew how many made it.

I already don't like the sound of this.

I would've come sooner, but...I didn't... How're you doin'?

You believe that?

Forty-seven people drowned last night off the coast of Vancouver after paying smugglers twenty thousand apiece to get into Canada so they could get work in order to eat.  Only they got marched overboard at gunpoint instead.

These girls, kidnapped during the last month and sold overseas to the highest bidder.  The oldest is twelve.  The youngest about the same age you were when you escaped.

I'm looking for a lady who works here.

Know where I can find her?

But she does work here?

I need to talk to her.

Max something.  I got no clue where she stays.

Who is it?

What do you want?

How do I know you're telling the truth?

Help... Lemme go... No, don't let me go... Help...

Say the words, "I understand."

What about the other kids?  You get anything on them?

I need a favor... I need you to trace a number for me.

Craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him.

You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.

Tell me the truth.  Am I a female fog bank?

If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking.

A long time.

So are dogs.

Yeah, I can see to it your winning streak continues.

Not right now.

Probably a touch of what's going around.

Right, the big one-oh.

Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?

Or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending.

Does this person have a name?

Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you?

She was the one--

Thanks, miss.

Huh?

What the hell is that?

Whoa. Some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me. I'm a brewski man myself.

Well, Amanda, this has been quite a night. So far you've seen me and my dick throw up.  What's next? Projectile diarrhea?  Man. What a stud, huh?

You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?

Beth? I can't believe it.

I've loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you, Jeremiah. I've just always been too scared to show it.

I feel like such an idiot. Why didn't I just say something a year and a half ago? Man, think of how much time we wasted.

This is the best thing that ever happened to me at school! Not only are we on again for KISS in Detroit, but we're actually sitting right at the fifty yard line! I dare you dudes to find a curlier scenario.

Well, the least we, his only buds in the world, can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his sentence.

Will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead.

Yeah, she gives you shit and you take it.

There's only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just doesn't matter anymore, Lex. You familiar with a condition known as Absolute Zero?

What the fuck!

Uh... dudes?

Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.

Jam, listen up.

Hey, Look at the front entrance! A car's pulling out. The parking space from heaven. God is surely smiling down upon us tonight, dudes.

I'm sorry, guys. I thought it was a nice thing to do.

They're not idiots.

Grounded for the rest of the year?

Jeremiah... what's gotten into you?

Okay, you better have something really sinful for me this time, son. My patience is worn to threads and your mom will be here any minute.

I was insulted, so I asked her if I was wreaking some wicked b.o., right? Then she said no, she wanted to take a bath with me.

Hey, take it easy, man. This is the girls' crapper, remember?

I did it! I did it! We won!

The Chinese have a proverb: "That which appears too good to be true, usually is." There's gotta be a catch.

About fuckin' time if you ask me. I'm just going through the motions till I drop out anyway.

Man, that weed knocked Christine on her ass. She's sleeping like a baby stella.

Really, Trip, can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change?

What do you want?

Gimme your gun, boy!

I should hang up on you right now, but you're the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk. What are the names of the four members of KISS?

Good morning, mongrels!

I'm not following you.

Dea ex machina...

What'd you do, Donnie? What'd you do!

I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things.

Where are you going?

So when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? Like, do you dream?

Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?

What happened to your neck?

That's alright... I understand.

They suspended me for two days.

So, we call them... IMGs.

You want to skip fourth period and go to the Ridge?

I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.

I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's my fucking stepdad. I know it.

Come with me.

No. Frank.

You're such a fuck-ass.

He can't, Samantha. He's been suspended from after-school activities. Donnie... are you still with us?  How was your therapy session tonight?

Good Lord.  So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.

Know what?

No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.

Donnie Darko, perhaps, given your recent brush with mass destruction, you can give us your opinion?

Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.

Is the death of one species less tragic than another?

His name is Frank.

Don't you watch the news?

So, tell me about your day, Donald.

Can anyone else see him?

Is Callie still around?

Nothing.

So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?

People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.

That I did it again.

Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.

Where are we going, Donald?

How is that possible?

What is going to happen?

He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me.

It's too late. I've already ruined my life.

It's called "The Philosophy of Time Travel".

Thank you for seeing us... We... just felt that it was time to discuss...

So let me get this straight. No airline will claim ownership of the engine. So we have to wait for the FAA to decide who fixes my roof.  Fuck that. We're taking the money out of savings.

What?

Did you just call me a fuck-ass?

Kitty, I would appreciate... if you could wait...

There's no rule!

Hell-no, she ain't quittin'.

You-betcha.

I just, I just can't believe it. I'm Minnesota's American Teen Princess!

Shut up, yous guys. Look, Amber, I'm not gonna win. And let's be honest, a family only needs one "Liza" and you know Peter's got much better legs than me.

I'm lucky I have an after-school job where I can practice my talent.

Go on! Get out!

Mom!

That's it, I'm goin'...

C'mere. I love you so much.

Mrs. Clark, why are you doing this to me? Why're you pretendin' you don't know what's goin' on?

What?

Oh -- oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, Becky -- bring it on.

If you want seconds, then I'll make sure it's hot enough for ya.

Hi...

Oh man, you got leutefisk in your hair.

This here's Loretta.

Let's just say who should win, who deserves to win is Amber.

Well, excuse me, Annette, but I'm braggin' up your kid, here.  Amber's gonna be the next Diane Sawyer, y'know...

Don't fall for it. She lives two trailers down.

We're also the co-founders of the Minnesota Modeling Academy. Applications are at the tiki bar. We'll wave the fifty dollar application fee if you list a friend and put her address.

What a surprise. Gladys Leeman's finally gonna go to State. And she'll probably ride on Becky's ass all the way to Nationals, too.

Hey, ya like it? Open it... Yah -- the globe. Pull at the equator there.

Lester?

Hey, Ted, sorry. I didn't know your family was in the garage when I set it on fire!

That's enough!

...that filth is better left in the "Sin Cities."

Iris, stop!  It's not his fault. The communal wine just proves too temptin' for some of them.

Oh! What is it?

What!

EE-AAAYEEEE-AAAAYOUIAAAEEEEEEEE!

Of course you're All aware a king must have an heir some one to pass the family name along will some one tell me where I'd ever get an heir if a king can do no wrong

You can't say that to the President... Put back "President"... Now let's hear how sounds.

That's what I wanted in the first place.  Tear it up and send it airmail.

Dear Sir... enclosed find check for $100.  Yours very truly...  Send that immediately.

Father...

Eureka Ammunition Company -- Gentlemen -- Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight --  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way --  However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty --  -- and I don't say that to everybody --  Have not received last month's drawing account.  How come?  Your neck is like a swan...  Yours very truly.  Now read it back. 

Well - what is he now?

What do you whistle?

That's no good.  I like to work on the outside.  I must have something easy.

You've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to me -- Now, who can I insult?...  Who do we owe money to?...  AMBASSADOR TRENTINO!  How about him?

You're lucky I don't slap your face -- you oughtta be ashamed of yourself. Where did you hear that story?

Wait a minute.  What kind of an army do you think we oughtta have?

I'm glad I didn't ask you for "Washington Crossing the Delaware".

Well, we'll let that one go.  Now -- how many battalions you got?

Are you sure you're not tired?

I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll give you Mrs. Teasdale as security.  or my jackknife.  If you want my advice, you'll take the jackknife... I've a better proposition...  Make it $25 and I'll give you a first mortgage on my son and I hope you foreclose.

When you get through with her feet, you can start on mine.  I haven't been to a chiropodist in two years...  If that's not an insult, I don't know what is.  Gloria, I love you.  I --

This has gone far enough!  This interruption is humiliating, to say the least...

Oh -- you mean... worm?

What'll I do with this card?

But -

Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.

If only we can get his Excellency to listen to reason...

And here is one of Frederick's mother.

You stay with me.

...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.

Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?

You sly bastard. You're doing this to spite me, aren't you!

What are you going to do?

Don't!

What happened?

He's a clumsy git. Never watches where he is going.

He's a freak! That's how they live. We're partners, him and I, business partners. You're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood!

A hospital is no place for secrecy, Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment. Why wasn't this patient properly admitted, and why is he in isolation? Is he contagious?

What are your plans then, Treves... You are aware that the London does not accept incurables. The rules are quite clear on that point.

I certainly sympathize with your problem, Treves... Why don't you try the British Home, or the Royal Hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him.

A few words? I thought he was imbecile?

No, Treves, it's out of the question. Now if it was up to me, I'd say "Certainly, let's meet the fellow, by all means," I'm sorry, I simply can't speak for the other members of the committee.

It's only a physical problem. He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth. But he can talk, and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him. So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying, just tell me and I'll make it clear.

Yes, I spoke to both the British Home and Royal Hospital for Incurables. I'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly.

How did you, know the rest? I never taught you the rest of it.

You are quite right, Treves, this is an exceptional case. And I quite agree that the committee should see Mr. Merrick.

Don't we?

Don't you think this is a bit premature? We don't have the backing yet to...

Are you comfortable here?

You never mentioned his mental state.

O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?

What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?

Good day...!

Tell me about it, please!

John, I'd like you to meet one of the brightest lights of the British stage, Mrs. Kendal. Mrs. Kendal, John Merrick.

It's all arranged. I'll send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany Mr. Merrick. You'll be using the Royal entrance and Princess Alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box.

Is he... dying then?

What's this?

Yyyy... Yyye... yyyess.

...Yyes

John, may I introduce you to Sir Carr Gomm.

How long will I stay here?

It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit with you very much. It's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself.

Who are they of?

Stand up, John. Let them see you.

The workhouse.

Good Lord, Mr. Treves!

Yes sir.  What's that?

So you see, John, there's no need for a lighthouse. All your friends are here.

HE'S GONE!

Are you the proprietor?

Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!

Well... where is he?

It's your fantasy...

It's all right! It isn't happening!

What's the matter?

What?

Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?

Where's the Cloak Invisible?

But you don't realize....

Blow the third note! The note to take us home!

I don't want to live WITHOUT you.

LOKI! Where did YOU come from?

Is it night or day, Erik?

But you don't want to hear it.

Of course we're not; we'd genuinely like to hear you sing.

We're just not a very musical nation...

Your Majesty! We come from a world where there IS no music. Where men live and die by the axe and by the sword...

Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!

Is there something the matter with it?

It's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life.

Of course I like women... I LOVE 'em.

I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all?

I just said I didn't feel like raping you.

Thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death.

FIND the Rainbow Bridge?

What are you talking about?

Erik! Row! What are you doing?

What's wrong with making friends?

Halfdan the Black's here!

Slower! Nobody can row at that speed!

Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif.

Look, the sky is blue...

Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.

First we're flying -- now we're sinking!

A magic dishcloth.

And you, Keitel Blacksmith.

Well, what else do we do?

So Halfdan the Black's using magic, is he? Well, I have a magic to match his! 

I AM one, Dad!

Bye, Leif.

Yeah... well...

There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.

And a sort of slightly sick feeling?

Oh! Who cares? We're HOME!

Help!

Made by YOU, Loki!

It's a tradition.

So did my father and his father before him.

But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.

You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.

And you've got BOTH axes?

And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.

I don't know, honey. It's horrible.

Thanks, guys.

Yeah.

Who was the girl you walked off with?

But I thought, I don't know, I thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what I was feeling and that you were attracted to it.

And I just liked you so much.

I just thought I'd say hi. I was in the neighborhood.

Come over after I'm done here?

It's so cool. You're by far the most sensational person in the room.

I didn't have a chance to wrap it.

What's wrong with me?

No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.

Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.

Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then.

You're sure? It's cold.

It's okay.

Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.

Take care.

You like that?

Frost?

It's pretty.

Well, I should probably get going.

Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?

You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God, I'm an idiot.

Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?

That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.

Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?

You should stay.

I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.

Yo ho ho!

Let me drive you home.

Let's talk about it later.

What?!

You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!

So, um --

You don't tell me things, Joel. I'm an open book. I tell you everything. Every damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust me.

Joely...

Such a beautiful view.

Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?

I scoured the city for it.

I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away, after all.

Well, you're married.

Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.

I had you pegged, didn't I?

I know.

You said...

Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.

This is it, Joel. It's gonna be gone soon.

No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated.

Me too. There's this poem --

Do you know her poem that starts "Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which we don't live...

Cool.

So go.

Bye, Joel.

Says you were closed off, non communicative, never told me what you were feeling.

Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?

Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.

What took you so long?

She's so sexy.

I can't. I have to go home. I'll do it later.

Okay. I wish you could come.

I'm sorry you saw one of our notification cards. You never should have.

We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about --

Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.

The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.

How was it?

Oh, sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We were taking each other for granted and --

So you think the dissertation will get published?

Stan... c'mon...

Let him go, Stan. I can help.

It's amazing, isn't it? Such a gift Howard gave the world.

It's not erasing. He's off the screen.

Hey.

It was here. At his car. I was coming back from a job and spotted you together. You seemed caught. I waved. You giggled.

I really like you, Mary. You know that.

What's this?

Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."

Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.

That's lovely.

It's fine, Mary. I'm happy to hear it.

I'll go out for a smoke. If no one minds.

So, I've got to drop the van off.

Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people.

Mary hates me. I've never been popular with the ladies.

The Clockworks is one reason that I am here on Siwash Ridge. I accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman by an aged Siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the Clock People.

What do you believe in then?

I want to go back to the Clock People. I kind of miss those fool redskins and wonder what they're up to. What's happened to Jelly?

I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?

You don't?

Tell me about it.

You're political, then?

Looks like every time we get together things are in a mess.

No, I guess not.

Whose fault was that?

Thanks.

Are you in show business?

For magazines?

Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever.

That means top-secret, Cooper.

Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you?

Holy shit...

Time to play Spam in the can.

...cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission...!

...come on, Skipper, I already put my shoes on...

Captain Miller, we're ready to repressurize the Clark.

...and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before.

Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical on me.

We'll have to re-route through the port conduit to the APU.

Please... kill...

What's wrong?

You wanted to see me, Admiral?

Incredible... These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared... this, this happened? This isn't some kind of hoax?

It's against my better judgement, but I'll run this by the Man downstairs. You'll know my decision by the end of the day.

You're not seriously considering sending him?

Does he know that?

What, Justin, what shows you?

What does?

You've reached the First Containment Seal. The engineering decks are on the other side.

I've reached another containment door. This thing's huge...

...I don't want to die...!

What's the hold up?

I put in for a replacement for you but no one...

Jesus its huge.

The blood came from somewhere, Peters...

Okay. I'm on the bridge.

I found one.

Hold on, what's this "gravitational distortion?"

What could cause them?  What's in the Core?

It's insane.

I want this room sealed. The Second Containment is off limits.

You have something, Dr. Weir?

We barely have enough power for life support as it is, if we can't stop the drain, we're not gonna make it.

If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too.

I'm not asking you to believe me. You'll see for yourself... and so will your crew. You're all coming with me.

I don't like it either, but you know the rules: we get the call, we go. Is the course locked in?

I guess we're about to find out. Keep us slow and steady.

Captain Miller, you copy?

Sir.

It tastes bad.

It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.

I thought of that, with the filters from the Clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. After that, we'd better be on our way home.

Who?

It's not bullshit, it's the only conclusion the data supports...

What?

Weir activated the drive. He's sending us to the Other Place.

Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?

No. I saw nothing.

There's no one in the corridor but us.

Yes. Yes, Justin, we heard it.

Where is she?

Jesus, that is one big ugly fat fucker...

Foredecks. Crew quarters, bridge, medical and science labs, hydroponics, what have you. That central section connects the forward decks to the Engineering containment area. Can we move in closer?

Miller, do you read me, Peters --

What if the air has gone bad? We can't wear these suits forever.

The reactor's still hot. We've got several small radiation sources, leaks probably. Nothing serious.

What is it?

What is it?

How'd you know it was me?

You don't know what it's like out there. Walking around like some kind of circus freak. People staring, whispering --

I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.

About me? How sweet.

What do you want, Vic?

He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."

I'll be watching over you.

What did you wish for, honey?

Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here? This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --

I can't take this.

He knew about NASA. What if he made the call to shut us down --

No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.

I had it at four.

Isn't that your speech?

This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.

The shields on the station should protect us.

Are you alright?

We had a tough year.

You got a chisel round here?

Ben --

Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.

Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.

Reed?... Sue?

Me like-y.

Now what is up with that?

Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--

Back it down, Johnny!

What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.

Johnny. SUPERNOVA.

Apparently I can disappear.

Sweet.

How's the IPO?

I mean, you broke up with me, right?

Reed. How close are we to a cure?

I found a broken gasket, from space --

Ben's still out there --

Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?

'Scuse me.

Were those flowers really for me, Brad?

Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!

Something happened to them, mon.

Come on, Hamilton. You're going over there to represent Captain Kidd Fish and Chips. We have stores all over Southern California. Part of our image, part of our appeal is in our uniforms. You know that!

Everyone wants to know where Lisa is. How should I know where Lisa is?  What am I gonna do? Now my little sister goes to the same high school. The party's over.  So who do you have first period?

Thanks for getting rid of those flowers.

It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.

Is everything okay at work?

Hey, Brad. Are you still a virgin?

Any problems?

Did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way?

Leave me alone.

Hey! We came over to help you with Math homework!

You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him?

Do you want to take a quick swim?

Pick a suit.

Are you really a virgin?

Oh. Hi.

Why don't you call me up tonight?

Take that back.

All right... where did you see her?

Don't talk to her. Let her know. Use your face. Use your body. Use everything. This is what I do. I just sent out the vibe and I have personally found that... girls do respond. Something happens.

No. I don't think so. Not right now.

She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.

Jesus. I'm sorry.

You're losing it, Damone.

All right, what you want to do is go to the Free Clinic and tell the doctor that you have sex regularly -- several times a week -- and that you need Nornel One Plus Fifty's.

Merv, this is the action down at Sunset Cliffs at about six in the morning.

That's him! He did it!

Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.

Yeah but they look more sophisticated. You'd probably think they'd be better in bed.

Well I never did it.

You'll always remember your first time.

You've got to get used to working Christmas. People are always screaming and yelling... then they get home and they're all Christmasy.

I guess Ron hasn't called yet.

Don't you think it meant anything to him. Even if I am fifteen?

Does that ever happen?

How long does Doug take?

God, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban.

It couldn't be.

Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!

You know, there's one thing you didn't tell me about guys.

Another summer of working at Swenson's.

Dartmouth?!

I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff.

Do you want to sit there, Jeff?

Thanks for picking me up.

It's very warm out tonight.

You keep them.

Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?

I had a really nice time tonight.

Aren't your parents asleep?

So... pretty nice house you've got here.

This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan?

Where's Mike today?

What's April 16th?

What about the notes?

Hi, Mark.

Are you ready to order here?

Certainly, Mr. Duke!

Oh, and could I get a quart of Wild Turkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and a night's worth of ice delivered to my room, please?

Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?

What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?

Hell, no. We'd never hear the goddamn end of it.

We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.

Where ya comin' from, young man?

I didn't think so. Because in spite of his race, this man is extremely valuable to me. Hell, I forgot all about this beer. You want one?  How about some ether?

Thanks for the ride. Thanks a lot. I like you guys. Don't worry about me.

Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?

He said he understood, but I could see in his eyes that he didn't. He was lying to me.

Turn up the fucking music! My heart feels like an alligator! Volume! Clarity! Bass! We must have bass! What's wrong with us? Are you goddamn old ladies?

Savage Henry has cashed his check! We're going to rip his lungs out!

How long do I have?

Two Cuba Libres with beer and mescal on the side.  Who's Lacerda, he's waiting for us in a room on the twelfth floor?

I just went upstairs to see this man Lacerda. I told him I knew what he was up to...  He says he's a photographer! But when I mentioned Savage Henry he freaked! He knows we're onto him!

What are you talking about?

Please, don't tell me those things... Not now.  This is my last drink. How much money can you lend me?

Can we make it?

Fuck yes. I was beginning to think I was going to have to go out and get one of the goddamn maids to do it.

You cheap honky sonofabitch...

Listen, she's running away from home for something like the fifth time in six months. It's terrible.

You filthy bastard. I should cave your fucking head in.

What?... What kind of goddamn monster are you?

I saw these bastards in Easy Rider, but I didn't believe they were real. Not like this. Not hundreds of them!

This is a fucking nightmare.

What's wrong with you? Hell, somebody has to do it.

Sure. It's all on the Q.T., but everybody who matters is with us all the way down the line.

There was nothing in the atmosphere of the North Star to put me on my guard...

What are you doing? You were supposed to turn back there!

The airport is over there!

Don't take any guff from those swine. Remember, if you have any trouble you can always send a telegram to the Right People.

Maybe she's telling the truth. Maybe she's not part of it.

You'd pay me for that?

Could I have that, please?

You realize...

Come on, baby don't try to tell us you never heard of the Grange Gorman.

My god damn foot is gone! Who fuckin' shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!?

I don't think you should...

Stop it.

Okay, now. Easy steps. Easy breaths. Easy steps.

Wha?

And that's how I ended up here.

They're right here.

Jesus Christ, I'm gonna have a stroke.

Don't bullshit me! If you know a way out of this place and you're holding out --

What tunnel? Where?

This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go.

I'd love to be macho, but this is a pants wetter from all angles.

That's an unwise thing to say, you know that?

So, what now? Did those things leave?

Your brother, huh?

I'm in.

All right!  Tell us about the truck!

Oh, no.

Really?

Will I go crazy or something?

Um-hmmm.

How much you got?

What? Really?

My husband...

He's dead.

Jesus Christ on the cross... Someone make sense.

Will these boards hold?

Go for it. It's by the far wall. A small wave band. Channel 9 is the emergency frequency. But I don't see the point.

How many?

Keys.

Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!

This one will just stun ya, but this one will put ya to sleep.

Sit still, look less like a meal.

Welcome back.

They were all over the place.

Bullshit.

Clever fuckers.

Fine, Chief.

Hurry!

Yeah, I'll go.

Do we have anything else to defend ourselves with? Anything?

I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side.

Hey little bear, aren't you going to join the others?

Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.

I guess so, sir.

Since we have you on a seven year contract, I'm planning long-range. I'm going to loan you out to Sam Goldwyn to make a picture called "Come and Get It."

I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?

Face it! Confess it! You're weak!

You're afraid!

Okay, but come here first.

The Group is more than a theatre company. It's the embodiment of an ideal. Our approach allows the actor to be an artist in the fullest sense, a creative individual and an instrument of change. You see --

Forgive my indulgence. Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. The point is, Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful play. Most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead...

That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.

But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people!

Hey, where's the fire, sister?

Get your clothes on, lady --

You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it?

Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn well better get used to it!

Harry!

We're all square now, Harry. Right?

You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?

This is the answer: a subscription drive to "Voice of Action!" First prize is a trip to Moscow! You could visit the art theatre, maybe even meet Stanislavski!

I know that, Dad, but --

You know where you're taking me. You know what she'll do. Just give me a minute, slow down, give me an instant for once in your life, please?

Bread?

You're poisoning that child's mind.

See you next weekend?

Kurt!

Only if you were in it. Are you?

Gosh! You'll break a lot of hearts.

Okay then...

But I'm not. The newspapers're --

Sure don't talk like you're sixteen.

Don't be a rat, Harry.

Honest. When you were up there, you were really... there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid.

Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.

Frances...

How ya doin', Farmer?

Not bad. But come on, Harry; what's the real reason?

You're telling me.

Frances, you're a movie star now. If you give them what they want, you can get anything.

Harry? Harry, where are you?!

Two lines! Two fucking lines! 'My wife returns from Europe tomorrow. I can't see you any more.' Just like that!

Nice joint. Can you afford it?

What for?

Six months' probation...? You gotta learn when to do battle, Farmer. You're not going to win many bouts with 200 pound cops.

Harry, I have to go home. I have to talk to Mama.

You know something, Harry?

What a man!

To quarter-horses.

Why are you always leaving me, Harry?

You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.

I know a thing or two about marriage. You... you understand me more than anyone, Harry... maybe even more than Mama. But... you're too important to me. I'd fail you. I don't know how or why, but I would. And that's a chance I just can't take. Do you understand?

Frances, it's me, Harry?

I love you, Harry. I love you.

Been a lot of years, you know. A long time waiting. For what? End up feeling like a sap.

I got a new car. Only it's red. Did you know Mama died?

Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry...

Yeah.

...Is that not true?

Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?

You're on your way to a contempt citation, young lady.

And what's the title of this seduc... assault?

I'm not!

You think I got it?

I don't care.

Tell them who I am! Tell them who I am!

And here's one from nice Mr. Zeiss. He says that...

Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense. You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now.

What?

I think I need a little air.

Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.

You know, the surest way to lose an appetite, is to drink, little sister.

Yes...?

No, my dear. You must be mistaken.

Do you expect me, for one moment, to believe you have greater insight into my personality than I do?

Normal. Average.

This whole thing is a joke!

I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said...

I'm sorry. She misunderstood, that's all.

Huh?

And do you think it's radical for a man to have a job and feed a family?

I've never been shown a kindness. Show me one now.

Friends? Do they live around here?

I have been... afraid. Afraid... they will hate me... because I am so very ugly... and they are so very beautiful

Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?  Who am I?

You will honor your promise to me!

That's the nature of all progress, William. Don't let your brother sway you otherwise.

I should go. I should leave today.

What kind of God is He to will this?

God took her from us.

Oh, do give him here! He needs to be comforted and held!

Don't listen, Willie. Progress is a feast to be consumed. Women would have you believe you must walk before you can run. Or run before you can waltz!

You will.  What do you want, Victor?

If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?

Do you know this man? Is there something between you?

I thought I'd never see you again!

No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today.

I remember the first time I ever saw you. Crossing the floor of the grand ballroom with my parents at your side. So beautiful even then.

Victor!

It's going to ram us.

What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.

Now you've got him started.

Only you would think of that!

You're making a scene!

We all know how hard you took Waldman's death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But it is time to move on. It is time to concern yourself with life.

We feared cholera. Turned out to be pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm.

In science, the letter of fact is the letter of law. Our pursuit is as dogmatic as any religious precept. Think of yourselves as disciples of a strict and hallowed sect. Someday you may be priests... but only if you learn the scripture chapter and verse.  Any questions?

Electricity.

Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.

It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous.  Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed cautiously. Assess as we go.  What I do on my own time is my own business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind? Fine, do so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal studies.

"...a sincere and heartfelt apology which you will then read aloud to him before the assembled student body and faculty.

Re-configure the leads?

You're awake. I've prepared some broth. It'll help restore you.

Ah. An explorer.

We are kindred, you and I. Men of ambition. Let me tell you all that I have lost in such pursuits. I pray my story will come to mean for you all that is capricious and evil in man.

So young, so pretty. What monster could have done such a thing?

Cabin B is ready.

Next Friday.

Steve said for you to start on the boats.

And it's this place. It makes no sense, but it spooks me.

Filmmaker.

Trouble?

I don't hear it anymore.

It sounded like Brenda.

I'll be along.

You know what I said, though.

What the hell?

What hath God wrought?

Ow!

Wind's up. It's shifted a good hundred and eighty degrees.

He keeps on acting like such an asshole!

Mmmmmmmph?

Best over...

Doctor. Now, if you were a flavor of ice cream, what would you be?

I told you not to buy that hunk of junk!

What is your purpose in Mexico?

What was that?

Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up to you?

Unless you two wiseacres wanna be introduced to the joys of hitchhiking, what say we drop this?

What's this guy's problem?

Okay, I'll kill you when you change, I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.

Why did they block the door again?

Where are the keys to the motor home?

My children are not going with you, and that's that.

Jacob Fuller. Jacob, that's biblical, ain't it? What am I askin' for, of course it is.  What are their names?

Where is the little lady?

I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this friendly. But you're right, enough with the getting to know you shit.  Now, there's two ways we can play this hand. One way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. The other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. Now, if we go down that first path at the end of the day, I'll win. But we go down the second, we'll both win. Now, I don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family. Y'all can live forever or die this second and I don't care which. The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our money. And right now I need to get those three things into Mexico. Now, stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the bank getting its money back. Right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. Am I correct?

I thought so. You help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody's happy.

Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.

Out of the stew pot and into the fire.

Why not, against your religion?

To your family.

You too, preacher?

It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?

I'm really sorry.

We have to go back for Daddy!

Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already alerted the Mexican authorities. They intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice.

We've received no news one way or the other. We can only hope for the best.

This can't be confirmed at this time, but we do believe it to be true. We have reason to believe it was the youngest brother Richard, and he was shot in the vicinity of his neck and shoulders by the store's clerk.

Hot goddamn day!

Not even for lunch?

Well, if there ain't there sure oughta be. Who knows what goes on inside Mongoloid's mind?

They'll probably make a run for the border, which would bring 'em this way. And if we get our hands on those shit asses, we're talking payback time. We'll get 'em all right. I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your commode.

What do you want from me? I did what you said.

Were you giving that pig signals?

I never said help us!

What dya mean?

What the fuck is wrong with you --

Start the car.

How's it feel?

I got both rooms on either side of us, so we don't gotta worry about eavesdropping assholes. How's that feel? You okay?

Where's the woman?

Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.

We are...  "South of the border down Mexico way."

Far out.  Where are my glasses?

What dya mean, don't worry about it. Of course I'm gonna worry about it, I can't fuckin' see.

That's what you think?

I'm lookin' scared?

My shit is together.

In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take it that's yours.

He's right, Kate. Daddy's dead! He was too far away. If flinging that door and filling this room with those bat-things would save him, I'd fling it. The only thing it'll do is turn us into one of them.

B.O.Q., south side.  Take a starboard tack out the door.

Okay, but... You didn't have to do what you did.  Not for me.

-- and now I got reporters from Toadsquat, Iowa, calling my office and askin' what I know about this "G.I. Jane" thing.

Uh, V.I.P. security arrangements generally take some time, Senator.

Of course, but there's more --

Well.  'Least now we're talking the same language.  So one standard.  Is that what you're after?

Then good night.

I don't know of any delicate way to say this, lieutenant, so I won't try.  Claims have been made that you have engaged in fraternization -- of the same-sex variety.  Specifically, that you were...  "... seen leaving the apartment of another female officer at such a time and in such a manner as to suggest conduct unbecoming."

Banditos on the east perimeter!  150 yards!  Shit, she was part of it!

White House boys want a private meeting.

Uh, question, ma'am.

Would I be the only one?  The only woman?

Uh, ma'am.

Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that --

It should.  You nominated him for Spec-Recon just three days after you nominated me.

What are you saying?  That a women's life is more valuable than a man's? That a women's death hurts a family more?

Montgomery, why do they call you "Flea"?

Well, Flea, I appreciate the respect you just showed me.  But I don't need it and don't want it -- not that kind of respect, anyway.  It's just gonna hurt us both, okay?

Really don't wanna be captured, el- tee.  Heard some bad things.

Six o'clock!  Marking, marking!

O'Neil?

Miller.  Thought the guy was made of depleted uranium.  Really didn't expect to lose him.

Automatic five-second deduction, which slips you under the wire. It's called "gender-norming," O'Neil -- standard procedure for all females in physical training courses.  Where you been the last few years?

Do we know it's him using the beacon?  Not a decoy?

Unless you Whiskey Run.

Well, you're doin' shit-hot at Intel.

Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you.

That bad?

So why are you telling me this?

Which is guy-speak for...

It was made clear before you came -- harassment equals career suicide. Can't say anything good, so they don't say much at all.  To your face, anyway.

So the shit you gotta go through? To get from here to there?  Brother said it was worth it.  Worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything.

At first.

Last time I didn't.

Do you, uh, know...

What're you guys doing?  Huh?

If not, firing will only give away our position to hostiles in the area.  Now how smart is that?

Say again, sir?

England went out with a stress fracture.  That puts you in charge, lieutenant.

Simple question, lieutenant.  No reason not to answer.  What is your father's name?

Would you have shot if it was a man?

That's what your crew said.  Are they lying?  Or are you?

I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew --

Do you?

Got it.

WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?

All right, fire-and-evade maneuvers. Drop everything but weapons and the PRC radio -- we're gonna be high speed, low drag all the way to the link-up site.  Ready?

Maybe we should call the Coast Guard.

Can't live with them, can't kill them.  What's the point?

You mind?  I'm trying to eat here.

This ain't about some little soldier girl sloggin' her way through commando school.  The implications go way beyond.

Okay, so now work it from the other end.  Think about California -- and how things might be handled there.

What?

Animal, you don't think that's true, do you?

Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you scared?

He stole my report! That's my report!

You okay?

Yeah, I just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me.

My God. He's going after the nest.

Don't you think we have enough?

He's not going to do it.

You're a reporter. That's what you always wanted to be, right? I'm happy for you. Really, I am.

Wait. I'm sorry. You're right. Eight years is a long time. Can I offer you a cup of tea?

Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?

...he's pregnant.

I didn't mean for it to turn out like this.  Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.

Circuits are overloaded.

Come on, the broadcast booth is right over here.

Are you okay?

Who was that French guy, anyway.

And I'm supposed to remind you to call him on all of Caiman's expense p.o.'s.

My life sucks.

I can't believe he put the moves on me. After everything I've done for him.

Hey, do you have any glue in your bag?

Mr. Caiman...

Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace.

Caiman, wait. Take me with you.

We did it! We've got the exclusive! Way to go, Audrey!

Three years digging up worms in Chernobyl? How did Mrs. Tatopoulos handle it?

Make sure they find that nest before it's too late.

Merde!

Dr. Niko Topopolosis?

You didn't answer my question. In fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions.

General Anderson, the problem was the terrain. If we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of Central Park...  We should be able to take him down.

Organize a search party. I want a complete sweep of the entire city and subway system.

We have learned that your American friends have decided not to look for the creature's nest.

How did you get all of this stuff into the country?

Dr. Lazarus... I hope that I'm not breaching protocol but.. I am so very humbled to stand in your presence... I have studied your missions extensively... Though I am Thermian, I have lived my life by your philosophy, by the code of the Mak'tar.

This is it?

Just as on your home planet, sir. If I may say, it took me three years to master the spikes, but now I sleep with a peace I never thought possible...

No, don't talk like that, son. We're going to get you fixed up.

Don't speak, Quellek.

You WILL go out there.

God, what an ass.

At ease men.

NO!  WE'RE ALMOST THROUGH!

What?  What?

ALEXANDER??? PLEASE? You're my advisor, advise me!

~hex!  Alex, are you oKav?

Settle down, Alex...

You were holding it upside down weren't you?

A boy comes to the door.

Oh my god, It's real.

May I get the check?

Back there. You said "the Commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals."

He always has to make the big entrance.

Oh.  Okay.

... Yes?

Yes, I know, and I want you to know I thought about what you said... I know you meant it constructively but...

... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-

Okay, we got it.

Commander, do you have a camera?  I'd die to see this in person... All they showed on T,V was a machine here, and a wall here... I don't know why they didn't show the whole thing.

But you don't?

Commander, you and Lt. Madison will have to go through the crushers one at a time in three second intervals. Tell me when the first crusher hits the bottom...

The enemy is matching velocity.

The digital conveyer?  You mean I'm going to get diced into cubes and sorted up there in a thousand pieces?

How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?

They're still behind us...

Guy, you're not going to get killed on the planet, okay?

"Assault on Voltareck III."  Episode... 31 I think.

They're gone.

You have no idea what a perimeter is, do you?

~e're alive!

A few fans built a little set in their garage.  .  I come in for an hour at most. It's a nothing.

This isn't mine. Wait, where is that kid?...

It's Jason...

Wait. When are you going to tell them?

We're leaving, Jason. We're leaving NOW.

We're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right?

Maybe we can lose them in that cloud.

What?  What did he say?

So... We get to shut down the neutron reactor?

We shouldn't have to DO this!  It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?

JASON  You think you could-get any closer to those mines?

Tommy, look!  Those lights...

Wait. What did you say?

Accelerate to Mark 4, Tommy.

Commander, I must speak to you. It is a matter of supreme importance... We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula, and we require your help. I beseech you to come with us, back to our ship. A great many lives hang in the balance...

I... certainly, but-

An interstellar vox.

To our brave guests.  Few in this universe have the opportunity to meet their heroes.  We are blessed to count ourselves among them.

Mathesar?. .. Has Sarris seen the.. historical records?

Sections of rooms made of plywood. Our Beryllium Sphere was painted wire and plaster. The digital conveyor was Christmas lights... Decorations.  It's all a fake.  I'm not him...  I'm a nothing. A nobody.

Well, it's... This was a device we...  discovered on an alien planet.  We don't know what it does either.

The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.

Damn-it!  You've given us a whole new season, Benedict!  And Congress thinks that the British are going to ride right over us come spring. Now half their army is back in Canada.

What do you think, George, shall I resign?  It's what they want.

The army needs you.

Wil, I'm giving you your freedom. Do you understand?

What sort of boots would you say he's wearing?  I should say, no sort of boots at all.  Aren't those rags wrapped around his feet?  Is that what he marched here in?

And, is that a pitchfork beside him?

I am to take command of Major General Lafayette's division and lead the attack.

Excuse me, General, but may I ask how do you feel?

They're among the best divisions the British have.  No conscripts, no impressed recruits, just professional killers.

What are we going to do?

General Greene is here.  There are two other divisions here.

Sir, I think no such thing.

This is a declaration of insurrection!  Who wrote this!?

I want to address the officers, all the officers.  Next Friday.  Can we arrange it at the mess?

If he supports the British why is it that every time he gets near them he kills so many of them?  Unlike General Lee... who you and Congress backed for second in command and who is a goddamned incompetent!

Partially...

A grand scheme?

What do you mean you're not a Christian?  Of course you're a Christian, we're all Christians...

'Continentals', Congress' paper money.  It was worthless to start with, but as you see, counter feiters have made them even less than worthless.  Can you tell which one is fake?

'Charming little victories?' Please don't expect much more of us, Monsieur.

Because, if the British got off their asses and came up here, now, we would be smashed.  And the revolution would be finished.  Tell King Louis, it's that bad.

I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be destroyed...

When I was a young man we used to recite Cato... We would come together recite it like they were words from heaven.  Devotion to country, duty, purity of heart... Purity of heart.  I was drunk on something then...

Did you know that Jefferson has proposed a law in Virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the church?

To win this war I need an army.

We can't take them.  Are you all right?

Nathanael, someone bred to station, bred to being a gentleman -- unlike these men -- his sense of duty naturally prevails over the baser needs.

I certainly didn't mean you.  Of course you are a gentleman, an officer and a gentleman.

General Greene?

Sir, if you don't mind my saying, I don't understand your history at all.  I mean, why would you want to win the war?  You're not after glory, like Benedict...  You're a slave owner, and yet you invite blacks to fight in your army.

What the hell are we doing?

Well, this must be about something!

Well, the widow Curtis will bring you riches, position, land, even half-grown children.  You won't have to do anything at all!  You shan't have to do another thing to prove yourself.

You remember, George, when we were 'studying' the great philosophers?

So, you are William's wild young neighbor?  Or should I say, 'brother'; William claims you as a member of his family.  I have heard so many unflattering tales about you, and I understand, that except for you, this 'family' is quite cultivated.

We can grow three primary crops in a season and, if we have some luck, we get a forth.  The temperature is generally mild.

Africa?  That's so far?  How do they get here?

What do you really think of the minuet, anyway?

I always though London was the place to be:  capital of the world, the most spectacular city on earth.

What are you doing?

I've been surprised in an unguarded hour, But must not now go back; the love that lay, Half smothered in my breast, has broke through all, Its weak restraints, and burns in its full lustre.  I cannot, if I would, conceal it from thee.

I say!

Is that your test of patriotism, George; if a man will die for you?

I reserved a Cadillac.

And I mean high up in it.  That's why Harry's gonna make Mr. Lovejoy with me, not Chili Palmer.

Doesn't matter what it's called, Harry's got Martin Weir and it's gonna be big.

What about him?

You get life for kidnapping.

And that's for the airport.

About sixty.

Where is my nephew?

He's around someplace.

No shit, come on. How you gonna do that?

Get something going there.

I really think I can be of service on this one.

I need the money.

Karen? You okay?

I'm at 8150 Wonderland Avenue. It's right off Laurel.

Where's Karen?

I'm working on a few things.

The airport.

Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.

Where's Leo Devoe? Where's Chili Palmer? Where's my fuckin' money?

What?

How'd you get in here?

So what brings you to L.A., Bones?

Get in line, bro.

You a quick draw... 'bro?' You better be, your piece stuck way down in your belt like that.

You're an investor, is that it?

Your wife a Lakers fan?

That's the idea. I'll think about it.

Guy owes us a hundred and fifty grand, sixty days over; a movie producer.

I'm looking at you.

You want to hear this idea? It's about a dry cleaner who scams an airline out of three hundred grand. Go on, tell her.

It's the kind of situation, you don't pay, you get your legs broken.

Keep going.

You mean, Leo?

Murray Saffrin, guy who wrote it, did all my Grotesque pictures, had it in a drawer for twenty years. He shows it to me one day, tells me he's got a star interested, would I produce it.

That's the difference between you and me, Harry. I say what I mean. I want something from someone, I ask 'em straight out. I want Martin Weir, I go get Martin Weir. I don't fuck around with his trainer's shrink.

Here's your keys, Harry.

Really.

You got a miss. Leo Devoe. Guy's six weeks over.

Yeah, he told me.

Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month.

Which also means when I speak, I'm speakin' for Jimmy. So e.g. as of now, you start affording me the proper respect.

We talk different?

So you want to know.

Martin, I'm not connected to those people anymore. Not since I walked out of a loanshark Operation in Miami.

No, I want you to look at me the way I'm looking at you. Put it in your eyes, 'You're mine, asshole,' without saying it.

From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?

You take all my money, but you're borrowing part of it?

It's not one of these?

We call you a taxi.

Well, basically, this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand, plus he's a few weeks behind on the vig, the interest you have to pay.

But a week. That's a hundred and fifty percent a year.

A couple days ago by, people from the airliner come to see his wife, tell her how sorry they are and all that their plane exploded and offer her a settlement, the amount based on what he would've earned operating the dry cleaner's the rest of his life. Leo had some kind of trouble with his kidneys, so they were giving him about ten years.

I wanted to come by, apologize for coming into your house like I did last night.

No, no... you left the patio door open. You gotta stop doin' that, all the nice things you got around here.

Yeah... that was a good scene. I mean, for a horror movie.

I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream.

Yeah. It's a real gift.  I'm just saying it'd be nice, one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line. You know, like in that Bette Davis picture, "Cabin in the..."

You been here the whole time?

I got you a copy of the script.

I don't want to act in it, I want to produce it with Harry. Especially if I help him get Martin.

That why you came over here, to ask me that?

That was Martin. He wants to have lunch tomorrow. That is, if you can make it.

Yeah?

You don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor?

Harry... My God...

Harry, what're you doing? You're supposed to be in the hospital.

Momo could buy it, I could run it for him. Show some Cagney films.

All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't.

What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?

Hm?

I miss Murray, Harry.

So this means you've reconsidered our deal on Mr. Lovejoy?

Yeah, what'd he have to say?

Well. I got an audition tomorrow.

Harry, what're you still doing with those guys?

Harry -

Karen. Wow. Look at you...

Oh, for Christ's sake -

But you are interested?

Hi, sweetface. You look great. And mmmmm, you smell good, too.

Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. What type of vessel?

Are you crazy? Do you realize we got ourselves a ship? We own a ship, Dodge.

Fucker!

One minute I'm minding my own business, the next thing I know the whole place is burning up.  An oxygen tank must've blown on the welder. Started an oil fire.

Where from?

Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either.

If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago, we just hit the jackpot.

What other choices have we got?

Maybe that is his boat.

Smokes?

Yeah, from one side of the harbor to the other. But we got half the Bering Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to drag her over.

It's a bloody navigation hazard. One boat can't control a ship that size.

Mother fucker!

The number one turbine's pretty well trashed. Number two runs, but it's way underpowered.

It's a hell of a lot of money.

So what're we gonna do. That's the big question, right?

Yeah, yeah. I'm on it.

Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be doing if we don't get this boat running.

I didn't touch the fucking radio!  Ever occur to you there's somebody else on that boat, skipper?

That oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants.

Then why didn't they take it.

Stay away. Or else.

Coffee?

I think we'd be surprised where a drifting ship might wind up with a little wind and the right current.

Take it easy, you'll live longer.

What guy?

What? What the hell're you talking about.

You sure it wasn't me?

He needs a doctor.

How's he doing?

You're saying they mutinied for the gold?

Smashed it up pretty bad.

"Their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision. Distress calls have been made."

The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.

She said the ship was evil. That we had to leave right away. That if we didn't, we might never leave.

What do we do with him?

What do you think?

Over the gold.

So you killed them?

Let the buyer beware.

Red sky at night, sailor's delight.

Murphy, goddamit.

How much you figure that's worth, skipper?

Yeah, but we still gotta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to Sitka.

I heard that.

Greek citizen. Merchant navy.  Obviously we aren't the first to come across this ship. They probably stumbled across it just like we did.

What happened?

Say what?

We ain't exactly in what you'd call your high traffic neighborhood either.

We're still drifting.

What about the gold?

As I said, what seems to be the trouble?

These ladies was having themselves a discussion and you're interrupting it.

You're kidding, right?

Look, I told you I'm not going to college.

Guess.

Someone from the past.

Well, Maxine thinks she can get you a sales job at Computer Station. Normally you have to have references and at least two years of experience, but she thinks she can convince them.

Pumpkin? What's wrong?

What's wrong with you?! Tell him I'm not here!

Seymour! Hello! What are you doing here?

These are all valid comments, but I think we should see if the artist has anything to bring to this.

And how do you think this addresses the subject of racism?

I'm gonna let you handle the four thirty crowd by yourself - that way I can evaluate your performance while it's slow and ease you into the bigger crowds.

Look, that's the policy... if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater...

Look, we don't pay you to be a movie critic -- just do your job.

What can you tell me, young man, about the various flavors of "frozen yogurt"?

That guy rules!

What do you mean "why"?

Yeah, right...

Nothing.

When did I say I hated you?

You make me nervous! I always feel like you're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me!

Yeah, well --

How long have you been up?

I know, I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her.

These assholes are saying that I have to go to Summer school and take some stupid art class!

Oh my god, look! Is Stacy Himmler going out with Rod Harbaugh?

Did you sign up yet?

God, it's so weird that we're finally out of high school... We've been waiting for this our whole life! Now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want.  It's such a weird feeling.

Hey, look, the satanists are leaving!

What do you do if you're a satanist, anyway?

Maybe there's some weird secret satanic society that meets at the Quality Cafe and all of the other regular customers are in on it except for us.

Hi, Al!

Check out the Personals... maybe our future husbands are trying to contact us.

Hey - why do you have this?

Look, that's back when I hated you.

Hey! We forgot to call the loser!

You know, the green cardigan guy.

Look, maybe that's him!

What's he doing now?

This is way too creepy.

The W.C. Fields Fan Club Newsletter...  Oh my God, The National Psoriasis Foundation!

That was truly pathetic.

He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...

We're not sure yet, that's why we're looking.

What was that all about?

How about this one?

I'll be right back, I'm gonna go get a beer.

Anthony's II!

At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining...

I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him.

If it makes you feel any better, I don't think you could've gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff.

I think one of us should fuck Josh...

I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...

Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...

I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what's wrong with me... I really do want to move in with you.

You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.

Wow... finally.

Oh my God, you guys! I can't believe we made it!

Oh my god, what are you guys doing here?

Who does?

Oh, how "punk."

Well, if it isn't Enid and Rebecca, the little Jewish girl and her Aryan friend.

Fine, and how are you?

Why do you even want it? It would look stupid on you.

You know, like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music.

Is this one any good?

This track alone by Memphis Minnie is worth about $500 if you have the original 78. She was one of the greatest guitar players that ever lived, and a great singer and songwriter as well. I know the guy who owns the original and lent it for use on this reissue.

How much is it?

No really... I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds...

I mean it -- You leave everything to me -- I'm going to be your own personal dating service!

Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your five main interests, in order of importance.

I don't think so...

What are we, in slow motion here?! What are ya, hypnotized? Have some more kids, why don't you?... For Christ's sake, would you move!?

Yes, that would certainly do...

What did you tell that girl?

We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total idiot, that's all.

I'm not sure I have anything to drink... there might be some --

What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this?

"Four-piece Cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS"!

I promise I'll take good care of it.

Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ...

What is that?

What, like a girdle?

Never...

Actually, I've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked-up situation...

Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out.

Never mind, it's way too complicated...  Did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time?

Aren't you going to get that?

No, actually Joe told me you were here... so how come you never call me anymore?

So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff?

No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to --

I don't know... I'm sorry, but Dana's a very jealous person. I just don't want to screw that up right now... I'm sure she'll dump me soon and we can go back to being friends...

What are you doing here?

God, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty!

If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.

I'm just being realistic.

Yeah, sure. Of course.

You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!

Yeah, well... me neither...

Let me tell ya somethin', Joe... Listen to me, Joe... you can't hit a home run without swinging the bat!

Maybe she's got another boyfriend.

Did you remember to pay the phone bill?

What do we have here, Margaret?

She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was...

Why did you say she might be hiding from me? Did she say anything to you about me?

It doesn't pay very much, but I should be able to afford my own place in a few months... Do you think that's too soon? I'm really anxious to get my record collection out of storage...

Thank you, doctor.

There is no reason for fear.

Starting now, we attack them.

John Henry Patterson, come in. I'm Robert Beaumont.  Firm- I like that, tells me a lot about you-  -now why don't you tell me about me? To get you started, many people find me handsome, with a wonderful smile. I'm sure you agree.  Winning personality, heaps of charm?

You're certain about tomorrow?  But you don't seem excited. 

-then he feasted on him, starting with his feet-

-oh please- if I'd been against your taking this, you would have abandoned me. You've been desperate to see Africa your whole life.

I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?

I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-

John? I know this isn't the time to ask, but-

...one shot...

We need to talk.

Have you got it?

Samuel says you killed a lion.

They're used to people in trees, not in a clearing.  It may be tight.

I'll be bait alone?

It's certainly the best chance they've had to kill you.

Why do the workers look unhappy?

Did it look like this in your mind?

I am also liaison between these two.

For you.

Good news?

Why do you laugh?- you don't believe she taught me?

Why so many?

Where do you go next?

Do you need anything?  You want me to come in?

Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?

What do you want with my baby?

Hundreds of people.  Believe me, I didn't imagine this.

Oh no.

Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border.

No, you didn't, Frank.

Peter, this is serious.  I need to know if you think there's anything unusual about him.

You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?

I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.

Be careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter. But the bed's good and I just changed the sheets so if you get tired, feel free.  In fact, I think you should definitely plan on spending the night here.

I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.

Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?

I'm not even good for me.

Is this the spot?

It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn.  I can't be sure, Peter.

I know who you are, Doctor Venkman.  Busting any ghosts lately?

Well, good night, Louis.

I can't believe a person could actually live like this.

You're really good with children, Louis.  I can tell.  Why don't you come here and sit with me?

Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on television.

You pitiful, miserable creatures!  You dare to challenge the power of darkness?  Don't you realize what you are dealing with?  He's Vigo!  You are like the buzzing of flies to him.

I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the sorrow of Moldavia, command you.

-- the sorrow of Moldavia --

I command you.

The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year.  Bring me the child that I might live again.

Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt.

They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them for murder.  They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me.

Come on, Sherm.  You're my cousin.  Do this for me.  I'm begging you.

Yes, I did.  We were city champs.

So, Dr. Venkman, please explain to the court why it is you and your co-defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street.

I'd like to have a stool specimen

Boys, listen.  You're scaring the straights. Let's save this until tomorrow, okay?

Nothing.  Not a trace.

Six feet -- seven -- eight --

If you two are looking for a fight, you got one.  Who wants it first?  Come on, Ray.  Try me, sucker.

Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me.  I'm looking for an aerosol love potion I could spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would make her unconditionally submit to an unusual personal request.

Well, Holmes, what do you think?

This is what you do with your spare time?

What kind of tests?

Did you find anything at Dana's?

Don't tell me, let me guess.  All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?

It looks like a giant Jello mold.

My great-grandparents were Swiss.  I still have the pictures they took of the statue from the boat when they arrived.

Ready?

Yeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise.

You got a flux and a half.

I don't care what you say.  This could be a major Christmas gift item.

And pure --

How deep does it get?  That water's cold and I can't swim.

Is it a star?

Incredible!  Five for five.  You're not cheating on me here, are you?

Great!  Bring her, too.  But you better hurry.  I made nachos with non-fat cheese and they're almost gone.  I'll make some more though.

We're all professionals here, Miss ...

You play the cello!  It's my favorite instrument.

On a purely scientific basis.

Don't scream.

Who's the stiff?

He is a very close friend.  Do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment?

You must have gotten the last copy.

Do you want this body?

I don't know.  You've got two people in there already.  It could get a little crowded.  I want you to close your eyes and relax.  Now I'm going to speak to Dana and I want Dana to answer.

Right ... You're the Gatekeeper.  But I want Dana.  Dana, speak to me ...

What's that got to do with it?

That's very fascinating to me.  I read a lot myself.  Some people think I'm too intellectual.  But I think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time.  I also play racketball.  Do you ever play?

It's a great game!  You should play sometime.  I bet you'd be good.  You seem very athletic.  Do you have any hobbies?

Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job.  She paid with a Visa card.

Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever this bad, though.

Great!  How's it going?

At ease, Officers.  I'm Peter Venkman.  I think there's been some kind of misunderstanding here and I want to cooperate in every way I can.

The man is a psychopath, Your Honor.

Nervous?

Hey!  I'm getting a little tired of this.

Hey, Mister!  Can I see those guns?

Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.

Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?

Sorry, Buddy!

Set entry grid.

Spengler and I have charted every psychic occurrence in the Tri-State area for the past two years.  The graph we came up with definitely points to something big.

Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.

I don't know.  Talk to it.

If you guys are right, if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow, I think I could win the Nobel Prize.

Why don't I check out the building?  It may have a history of psychic turbulence.

So do I.

Ray -- Something's here.

Hey man.  What is it you're so involved with there?

Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?

You don't have to worry about that with us, sir.

Where are we now, Commodus?  Can you see the camp?  My Gods!  The air is turning into ice!

That's what you told me two days ago!

For the gods, spit it out!

Where have you been?

Tell Lykas to send a retiarius and a Samnite to help Tiger.

I am their hero!

Welcome back from your great triumph Narcissus Meridas.  My father sends his heart felt praise.  Sadly, Marcus is in dark humors -- nothing to worry about, but he needs rest. Likely just the weather.

Do you expect Marcus to be well enough by morning for an audience?

I back Rome against all her enemies -- if that answer disappoints you, I'm not a politician...

But they're not destroyed, not yet.

You and my father have become very close.  Perhaps one day I may say the same for us.

I'm ordering a general stand-down in preparation for withdrawal back across the Danube.

Where is my family?

Endorse me in public.  Do that and I'll make you rich and set you free. I'll return your estates.  I know you would give anything to be outside again.  Endorse me and you will be free.  Think of it.  What would you do with your freedom?

Gods of hell!  This must cost a fortune!  How many days is this going to go on?

So am I.

Give away food?

This is the only place in Rome where I thought -- I believed -- I was wholly in power.

Would you support the Senate if they would give you a trial?  You'd have to give me your word.

My loyalties... were in doubt.

Is this Rome?  Are we just going to be executed?

You know our two most senior Senators:  Gaius Cantus and Falco Verus?

If I'd ever had a sign that you wanted to rule I would have... no, again, it's my own bullheadedness. Narcissus, I should have adopted you years ago.  And now the Gods are begging me to make you my son!

They fear change.  The new Caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible.  You could be the one, the Emperor, the man who oversees the rebirth of the Republic.

Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators...

Quintus is overly idealistic.

Me?  Well, I believe in Rome... you'd have to after what I've seen, how people outside the empire treat each other.

When you get to Ostia, use this -- bribe passage to Africa or Spain. Save my family.  You should be able to find a merchant ship that will take you to Egypt then to Numidia.

Thank you.  What is going to happen tomorrow?  Exactly?

Take your hands off me animal!

Proximo, if this is her doctor he's an assassin.

No more bad luck now!  The people are anticipating you!  I have posters up over half the city advertising you as the great warrior -- the true Roman!  The man who fought side by side with the wolf of Rome!

Tiger's challenged you and Jerses has made me an offer, made us both an offer:  you take a fall.

You get to come alive again in the country!

So, things change.  The government has moved to the circus.  You're going to fight last.  And Commodus is going to fight first.

You're living at home now. Is that right?

Are you going to graduate school?

Do you want some dinner?

Could you do it?

But could you try?

We won't. Let's go inside.

Ben -- what's happening? Who is Mr. Gladstone?

I'm sorry. That is not my business.

Yes.

Why aren't you ready?

No -- don't cry --

What?

I said I think it is.

-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.

I don't want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan.

Benjamin?

You won't?

Why wouldn't it?

Are we getting married tomorrow?

Benjamin?

Oh.  Well -- I'm not sure -- but you might try the First Presbyterian. That's on Allan Street.

Ben -- I just want to say one word to you -- just one word --

Exactly how do you mean?

What's that?

You're not one of those agitators?

One of those outside agitators.

Oh -- hello, Mr. McCleery.

What did you do to her?

Mr. McCleery?

Look -- I'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- I'll give you twenty -- for God's sake, will you let me use that phone?

BENJAMIN?

Well here's the purse.

I'm putting it on the top step.

Can I help you, sir!

A single room or a double room?

Is anything wrong, sir?

Sir?

Is there an ashtray in here?

Benjamin, I want to ask you something.

Will you come in, please?

What do you drink? Bourbon?

Drink?

What do you think of me?

Did you know that?

No.

For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. You give me a drink. You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours.

It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.

Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.

What is wrong with me?

Her portrait?

No.

I think I'll go to bed.

Won't you unzip my dress?

Thank you.

What are you so scared of?

But I just -- Look -- what if Mr. Robinson walked in right now?

Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell what's real. I can't --

Hello, Benjamin.

Do you want to?

Why don't you get it.

I got a single room.

Oh -- yes. Wood?

Wood or wire? They have both.

You what?

That you're afraid --

Oh my God.

Oh.

Are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art.

What?

Him?

How do you get out of the house?

Always?

We're talking.

We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking.

Now let's keep going here.

So you don't -- I mean I don't like to seem like I'm prying but I guess you don't sleep together or anything.

Oh no. Are you kidding me?

Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?

I mean did he take you up to his room with him? Did you go to a hotel?

Oh no. In the car you did it?

What kind of car was it?

Really. I want to know.

Do you understand that?

We're not dropping it. Now that's the reason, isn't it? I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't I? I'm not fit to --

Did I say that?

Benjamin, I want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got.

What are you doing?

Oh no.  Look -- I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.

All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson.

Now listen -- this was not my idea. It was my father's idea.

Now it seems to me --

Hello. Get me the police, please.

Yes. Well -- goodnight.

Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.

I drive around.

Oh, no.

I don't meet anyone, mother, but why did you say that?

Oh. Well, I don't. Shall I tell you what I do?

I'm not. But I'm -- I'm not very proud of what I do. I usually get kind of drunk. I usually drive over to Los Angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk. Then I take a hotel room. So I won't have to drive home on the freeway. I mean it kind of scares me to drive home after --

Don't go on like this. Now if Benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out --

I'm going up to Berkeley today.

Well --

Would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that hard work?

She's upstairs. She wanted me to wait down here till you got home.

Here. It looks like you need a refill.

Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.

Thank you.

You have yourself a few flings this summer. I bet you're quite a ladies' man.

Oh say -- Elaine gets down from Berkeley on Saturday.

Do you have a special grudge against me? Do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me?

I am trying to tell you I have no personal feelings about you, Mr. Robinson. I am trying to tell you I do not resent you.

You miss the point.

Yes?

Are you ready in there, feature attraction?

-- before he does --  You're disappointing them, Ben. You're disappointing them.

I'm having luck for the first time in my life.

It's a short life and a gay one...

And what are you going to do?

Need any help?

I'll pay you back.

Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That? 

Reducing?

Too bad.

Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs?

We'll dance.

Chasing around.

You were very different yesterday.

Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.

Going?

Don't cry -- it tears my heart to see you sob like that.

So you feel like coming into a lady's room -- and you come... What now?

Go away. Who are you --?

You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you -- Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me?

What can you see?

And what do you do -- now?

You do believe that I really love you?

Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you come too -- I think it would be better -- for us -- for us both.

I'll give you what you need -- I have money.

Don't do anything foolish -- I'm alarmed about you.

Hello -- sorry I'm late.

Ready, Kringelein?

I take five hundred.

Here -- here it is. Here's your pocketbook, Kringelein.

The war.

Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here?

So that's how we stand, Baron.

Is that for me?

For me?

And the child isn't coming?

Any letters?

Telegrams?

Any letters?

Oh, but Doctor. Isn't this wonderful. To live -- to live -- in the Grand Hotel.

Excuse me, gentlemen.

I'm sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste -- distinctive, don't you think? Velvet upholstery -- 'A-number one'. I'm in the textile trade and I know.  And these are real silk drapes.

Mr. Kringelein -- How you have changed, you look so nice.

You must look at my face and not at the floor.

Really?

Please -- please!

Oh -- oh, Miss Flaemmchen. It's you --

So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was.

He was in desperate straits. He'd been trying to raise money all day. He laughed -- Poor devil! And then a man like Preysing kills him.

Of course I do -- I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it. Do you know --  I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing -- I'll take care of you. Will -- will you let me?

Moreover --

Moreover...

What is this?

You...

Cotton Company --

Is that Mrs. Preysing.

Miss Flaemm.

Come and dance with me, Mr. Kringelein.

Insolent young cub!

Come here. 

I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.

And ask me what it's costing us to hammer it down.

There's a lot of business to be done with the Manchester Cotton Company. They've the whole English market right in their hands. Have you any connections with -- Manchester?

All right.

If you actually have news from Manchester then...

How clear is Manchester?

Since, on the eleventh of June of this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger...

As you remember it -- when you approached us...

Nine-thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us waiting.

I can't dance tonight --

Ah, oui -- the car is here for Madam.

Good morning, Suzette.

Madam has slept well?

Madam will dress now, it is late.

Yes, Madam. And now Madam will sleep. It is not long 'till the train.

Madam, it is Mr. Meierheim -- he is waiting downstairs.

Oh! Madam is cancelling the engagement. Madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha, ha -- hurry, come on. Tonight -- there's a line in front of the theatre since six o'clock. The house is jammed to the roof.

Last night?... There was no applause.

Gru -- you are positively radiant.

Mr. Kringelein will take room number one-seventy-six, one of our most expensive rooms. It is large and on the front with bath.

Mr. Kringelein will be a good friend and not accept your invitation to dance.

What is this insolence?

You're discharged.

My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that.

Yes, I know them --

Just one moment, sir.

If the house is empty again, I don't know --

I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white.

Good morning, gentlemen -- I see the conference is already underway.

I can make no statement about Manchester at this time.

You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through.

She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at five o'clock -- she was in a hurry.

Hi, Bobo.

Well, I guess so. You're the guy I work for.

Now I'll ask you another. You think I got no contacts out here? That nag paid off at just the opening price. There wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted. There ain't enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a ten grand win! You send me ten thousand dollars, like I'm some mark you can blow off!

Your what?

He's a good kid. A salesman.

That's right. Take a little, leave a little.

Worries about his mother, eh? Give him a hug for me.

The kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different.

Right in front of the room.

Well, I'll have to take your word for it, Mary Beth. Here's your money.

Not much time.

Seven seconds. I don't see how you do it.

The ambulance is on the way, for what good it will do.

Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside.

His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.

Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.

You are a valued customer, as you know.

I can't understand a thing like this. It's something you almost never see.

All right.

Makes no difference to me if they're only on commission. If they don't make good money, they're not giving us good representation, and we can't afford to have them around. Ever supervise salesmen?

Sounds like a good Idea.

Well, uh... No.

So what's your story today?

Don't mention it.

Up to you.

Why?

I just give you your life. What you do with it is up to you.

If you come out to the track, don't know me.

Roy, I don't want money from you.

Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it.

I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.

It is, isn't it? And maybe it's a break for me after all. I've been wanting out of the racket for years, and now I'm out. I can make a clean start, and --

You want a drink?

Well, uh...

If I should get out of the racket, that goes double for you. That's why you've got to change your life completely, go to some town, get a square job, live like a john yourself. If you try to do it your way, what future is in it?

There's nothing more to talk about.

Joe, could we talk it over? Do you want a drink?

I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?

Well, well. In a real hurry, are we?

You aren't taking me for granted, are you?

That isn't granite. If that fell on me, it wouldn't hurt at all.

Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.

Her job.

And you never defend me. You're afraid of her.

I just bet you are, too. And now you're trying to rope me.

Think about it. Okay?

And hello to you, too.

Wait a minute! When did this happen, that we're partners?

I don't think I need it.

What I say is, no. We don't do partners.

You watch that mouth.

I realize this is a shock.

I'm sorry, it was her all right. Her gun, even.

I grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. It really is your mother, Mister Dillon.

Ate the gun. Oh.

Oh, Jesus.

That's that, then.

No thanks, I'm not thirsty.

One set of muddy shoe prints.

Where?

I'll be damned.

Mind if we sit down?

Do you know who did this?

Besides, it's historically inaccurate.

No shit?!

Nothing's changed since yesterday, or last week, or last month... the answer's still "no."

I promise not to run off to Cancun.

Shit, John!  What the hell were you doing out there?!

You're kidding with that answer, right?

It's an option.

Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...

Shelve the barf bag.  It's the key to the main gate.

Not me.

Are you crazy?  You'll get caught.

Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow night.

Aren't they doing a terrific job this year?

This kid just wants his freedom.

What are you looking at?

You aced it, didn't you?

Fuckin' A.

Shane's going as a condom.

Condom Boy is waiting for me in the cafeteria.

He do that to you?

Is Tim there?

Jesus, that's my neighbor.  Tommy.

Shh.  Mommy's here.  What is it?

Home is here in Grandma and Grandpa's new house.  At least while I'm in college. Remember our deal.

Come on, Mom.  We're gonna miss all the fun stuff!

See what I'm talkin' about?

I've been knocking.  The door was open. Is everything all right in here?

This house is sacred to him.  It's the source of his memories -- his rage.  Mrs. Strode, I beg you.  Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter.

Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?

She wasn't here when I brought Danny home from --

What now?!

Christ, what a night!  Not even so much as a sign for five miles on that road!

She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.

No!!!

What do you know about Michael?

It appears that we're going to have to wait awhile for any more action here, Colonel.  Why don't you run on home while the evening's young.

I suppose.

Home.

I didn't even scratch the surface. You're lucky, boy.  You come home, and nobody's here.  When I go home, everybody's going to be there.

Can I have the Cadillac?

You know what gets me about that Cadillac?

Months?

Could have happened to anybody.

Go live in a safe-deposit box--with your things. LOOSELEAF Jesus--I wouldn't want to be married to him.  You know?

I wouldn't want to be married to me. We're too crazy.  You know?

I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.

You never played a violin.

I know you think that.

Eight years you guys were together-- through thick and thin.

Are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die?

Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.

No matter what you say to me, I still think you're the greatest guy I ever knew.

You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.

And you've been roaming the streets while your mother is God-knows-where?

Man and boy.

Even this--"Herb Shuttle", you said?

What does he do--of an athletic nature?

Aha!  He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure.

Oh hell.

Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band--in the war against the Nazis.

I saw your father fight Major Siegfried von Konigswald, the Beast of Yugoslavia, hand to hand.

The Germans shot everybody who lived there, then leveled it, plowed it, planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground. They wished revenge for the slaying of the Beast of Yugoslavia.  To their twisted way of thinking, your father had butchered an Eagle Scout.  Play lots of contact sports?

Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!

Why don't you go to bed--son.

Tomorrow's Saturday.  Anyway, she's dead.

Dad's got jungle fever, Mom. What'll I do?  Mom!

Play?

Dad--

I'm a man.

Mom?

I don't know what I hope.  But I don't think you care what I hope, anyway.  You don't know me.  You don't know her, either.  I don't think you know anybody.  You talk to everybody just the same.

How do you do?

What sort of time period do you have in mind?  Half an hour?  An hour?

Disease?

I'm so glad you like each other.  I was so scared, so scared.

Harold!

Please--

We were one hell of a pair--and we'll be one again.  What we need is a honeymoon.  Let's start right now.

She's up in Heaven now.  She didn't hear.  She is experiencing nothing but pure happiness.  There's nothing nicer than that.  Chow!  Harold Ryan wants chow!

Fish can't feel.

I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.

Go on.

I came for Paul as well.

A dozen?

He knows you shattered his violin.

He cried.

See how you've upset him.  He was so merry and hale before you came home.

I bought him a twenty-two yesterday--on the way home from Hamburger Heaven.  And where is the good doctor?  Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere?

An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.

You're begging him to kill you?

No, we won't.  No matter how it begins, it will end in death. Because it always does.  Isn't that always how it ends, Harold--in death?

Norbert--you come, too.  Let him go, Harold.  Let him go.

...Who?... Did she say how far apart the pains were?... When was that?... Oh dear.

And her fiancé!  How nice.  I hope you'll be very happy--or is that what one says to the woman?

How was the emergency, Doctor? Profitable, I hope.

Tough luck.  You'll have to split the fee.

I feel the same way.  What next?

It died for your sins.

You're a filthy, rotten bastard.

I haven't told you, Harold, how comical I think you are.

Glands.  You're supposed to be happy when you die.  Call me comical again.

I put a poisoned thought in your head.  Even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind.  It's saying, "Obsolete, obsolete, obsolete," and, "Clown, clown, clown."

Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.

You're making a mistake.  Obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded.  You've wounded me.

What is this thing that kills me?

Give me your word of honor that that's all you're going to do.

Jesus--I dunno.  You know.  What the heck.  Who knows?

I dunno, boy.

Dead!

What happened?

So long, you guys.

Mr. Ryan just borrowed my birthday cake.  I don't really know him.

Aha!  Hello!  You're Mildred, right?

You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?

Because he was cruel?

Is it?  I have this theory about why men kill each other and break things.

Kid--kid--

You sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight.

Don't touch me.  Get out of the way.

Don't touch me.

Oh, Paul--

You know she has no feet!  You want him to abandon his mother, who has no husband, who has no money of her own, who has no feet?

In a railroad accident many years ago.

I hate that thing.

I don't get it.

What does he say to do?

Yeah.

We don't have a maid any more.

Everything stays as it is!

Don't worry about it.

It's fine!

He'd assume we had.

I see.

Gentlemen!  Is this right for a fight?  It's been so long.

Possibly.

Thank you, Herb.  You're a wonderful man.  You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.

Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.

"War is not healthy for children and other living things." How lovely.

Or get eaten alive.

Phooey.

You think you're so funny.  You're not even funny.  Right?  Right?  You don't hurt yourself if you start out slow.

If he'd just get into scouting, and camp out some, and see how everybody roughhouses around the fire--

We're going to have jackets, aren't we?

What we offer here is nude body to body contact on a bed in a private room. It's twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars an hour. Anything else you desire may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tips are allowed. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.

No, just not the type.

You're still dressed?

There's a girl I want to ask you about.

No, Felice, I'm not a cop. In fact, right now I've got as little respect for the police as you do.  I'm looking for a girl. A runaway. I need someone to help me.

What do you mean?

You want a tip?

Now, what do you want?

That's cool.

Yeah. He's a nice guy. Don't lose him. Maybe we could tone down this stripe a bit. It's a little...

Are you sure it's all right?

Are you the star of this picture?

The other girl is the star?

Are you Niki?

No. I saw her with Tod.

Where's he?

Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.

This is just temporary. I once made nine hundred in outcall.

Up front?

I thought you were going to bed?

Jesus.

And your wife? Where's she?

Okay. Sucking off. Now does that make me as good as you?

What's T-J?

You have to believe in something. What do they believe in -- the Whatjamacillit church?

Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.

He has to. That's Predestination. If God is omniscient, if He knows everything -- and He wouldn't be God if He didn't -- then He must have known, even before the creation of the world, the names of those who would be saved.

I'll admit it's confusing from the outside. You've got to see it from the inside.

Rot in hell, honey.  He's busy now.

Grand Rapids? Of course.

She left you right?

I don't blame you, Niki. Really I don't. It's this culture, where everything's based on sex, sold on sex...  ...magazines, music, TV. It's destroying everything. Buy this 'cause of sex, use this 'cause of sex. Kids think it's normal. They think they're supposed to talk dirty, wear scanty clothes...

Hello?

I don't know.

Yeah.  All over. Even here in Grand Rapids.

The police? They know less than you do.

Yeah. Probably.

Why don't you tell me something for a change?

Don't do anything more. I'll find out what I can.

What happened, pilgrim?

You want to go for coffee after we send the girls off?

What is it, Jake?

Is Marsha there?

Just do what I say. Don't ask.

Oh yeah? I remember that. It was made by some college kids.

She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other.

Meet me here today at seven o'clock. With the money. Then we'll go see the film.

What do you want?  Do I know you from somewhere?

Where's Ratan?

But I...

You don't want anything for your fifty cents?

Not exactly...

I got a picture here. I want you to tell me where to find this woman. I been asking everybody. Nobody knows anything.

What's that?

What does that do?

I'm off that case. He fired me.

Maybe. Maybe not.

You know Granville's looking for you, Niki?

I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around.

Was he with a girl?

Lady, you were going 70 miles an hour in a 45-mile zone. Could I see your license, please?

Okay, lady. Out.

But there is a family resemblance.

Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold?

How interesting.

Oh. Well, what is it exactly that you do?

Yes. Henderson Feed and Grain.

It's a question of emphasis, you might say. Accentuate the positive, so to speak.

Yes.

But this is my car.

Yearse!

She's very sweet, but so old- fashioned. Please sit down, Harold. I'll put on the kettle and we'll have a nice hot cup of tea.

I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?

A self-portrait.  But over here is my favorite. It's titled "Rainbow with Egg Underneath and an Elephant." Do you like it?

What do you think?

That's a nice teapot.

Why do you say that?

We'll transplant it. To the forest.

We'll come back in the morning.

A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?

Thank you.

Oh, that was fun. Let's play something together.

Okay?

He's stopped.

You are the wisest person I know.

Died! Seventeen times - not counting maiming.  Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood.

Maude, do you pray?

From the guys who got the matches, of course. 

Oh, Harold. You make me feel like a schoolgirl.

Oh.

Oh, you weren't scared.

- end where I began.

It looks like you. Thanks.

Please, don't you realize? She is dying.

I'm going to marry the woman I love.

Would you like a cigarette?

Tell me, Harold, how many of these, eh, suicides have you performed?

My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor. He's in the Army and he fixed it up.

You mean when I'm not working on a...

Your classmates?

What would you say?

That's right.

Yes.

Will they really teach me to shoot?

And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!

How about hand-to-hand combat?

I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.

Were you also the one who painted the statues?

Oh. No Boxes. Such a shame.

Well, well. All my family together again. How very sweet.

See? He's here. You should learn to believe your Uncle Frank.

I knew you'd come back.

So... You're Kirsty, huh?

Sad, huh? She's been here six months. Her name's TIFFANY.

I... I had a visitor.

Don't worry about it. Your attitude sucks anyway.

You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...

Get out of the way.

O.K. Let's go.

I'm scared.

Nonsense, I...

I thought Steve had talked to you?

Son. About Rasputin --

How does he know so much about me?

Got tired of me?

She's dead.

Names hold the power and nature of things. Mine for example. Rasputin: "The crossroads."  And crossroads I have become.  Your true name: Anung-un-Rama. Repeat it. Become the key.

Thank you.

Anything else you --

Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll deal with whatever's back there.

We miss you at the Bureau. Abe's crazier every day. And Father's still mad at me --  Come back, Liz. Come back. I --

You're going alone?

It's nothing. Just a list -- It's not finished --

Okay, someone's expecting us. Turn on your locators -- Anyone sees anything...

Dr. Broom asked me to invite you back to the Bureau. No special precautions, no security escorts. You and me in a taxi. Like regular folks.

But it's not true, is it?

Hit me.

Yes, I --

Wait! Wait! Watch the fucking paint work.

The box... you opened it. We came.

This isn't for real.

Let me alone, will you?

We want the man who did this --

Just in time.

Please. Get back into bed.

No.

Frank --

You're Julia, right?

What about Larry --

Don't look at me.

What happened to you?

My nerves... are beginning to work again.

Don't touch it. It's dangerous. It opens doors.

I was bored. I'd done everything. I'd gone to the limits. There was nothing left to experience. At least nothing I could buy on earth.

They took my body, but my spirit... they left that here. In the boards, in the walls. Watching the world, but not able to TOUCH it.

No, damn you --

I thought half of it was your brother's?

All right.

He's here?

How are you doing through there?

Are you all right?

Just a moment. Put on some music will you babe?

Who was it?

-- I'll go see.

Plain soda?

You know it's not often I... you know...

First time for everything.

Why don't you take off your jacket? You're warm.

Why don't you do the same?

Well, if you change your mind. What's this friend's name?

What did you say?

Great.

Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.

Take care, Dad.

Big house.

Are you O.K.?

What are you drinking, love?

I just wanted to be sure you were O.K.

He's gone.

PLEASE. You're in danger.

You're not going?

I'm here.

Not that late.

Oh!

Are you busy after work ?

Can I lend you a hand?

What's wrong?

What did I say?

Rob.  Rob Gordon.  Circa junior high...

Play it.

How can it be bullshit to state a preference?

Not the point.

What did he ever do to you?

"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --

Fine by me.  I still want pay to 7 o'clock.

Don't be sad, Barry.  You'll find true love someday.

The band that found me and asked me to join.

Isn't it?

Great!  That's fucking great!  They only asked you to sing because of your name!  You can stick it above the browser racks over there.

It was Jan, and it was a long time after--

What the fuck is that?

Sonic Death Monkey.

Barry, you're over thirty years old. You owe it to yourself and your friends and to your parents not to sing in a group called Sonic Death Monkey.

You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night.

Well what about the new Echo --

No, not nothing.  What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers?

It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a "The."  But I could be wrong.

Who are you going to see?

Anna Moss.

Okay, okay -- "Leader of the Pack." The guy fucking cracks up on a cycle and dies right? "Dead Man's Curve," Jan and Dean...

Where's Rob?

May I help you?

What I mean is, I didn't mean you look young.  You don't.  You don't look old either.  You look just as old as you are.  A bit younger maybe, but not a lot.  Not much.  Just right.

Well if one of them is this "Sin City" thing --

Fantastic but I'm a little busy right now.  Listen.  Do you want to come to dinner Saturday?  I'm having some friends over and I need a spare man. Are you a spare man?

Why did you break up with me for Marco?

Huh?

Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one.

What's this?

Rob --!

What is this.

Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm off the phone.

I'm upset, but I'm fine.

Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now.

Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?

So shall we leave it at that then?

Hi.

You used to care more about things like Marvin Gaye than you do now. When I first met you, and I made you that tape, you loved it.  You said -- and I quote -- "It was so good it made you ashamed of your record collection."

So you weren't interested in music at all?

Yes.  Look at me.  Look at our -- the apartment.  What else do I have, other than records and CDs?

Have you tackled the Great Reorganization yet?

So.  Where have you been staying for the last week?

I'm sorry.  I haven't been very fair to you.  That's why I came here to the store this evening.  I feel terrible, Rob.  This is really hard, you know.

I suppose so.

Well if you could tell me roughly it would help.

I don't know.

The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.

I told you I slept with him.

And anyway, I keep trying to tell you, that's not really the point, is it?  The point is we got ourselves into an awful mess, Rob...  Are you there?  What are you thinking?

This is where you're supposed to say that you haven't laughed this much in ages, and then you see the error of your ways.

Okay, okay.  I get the picture.

I got it.  You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him.

Liz'll give you a lift.  She knows where to go and everything... I don't have time to talk, Rob.  I've got too much to do.

Are you going to lie in that flower bed all night?

What do you mean?

Look, we can do other things.

What about Ian?

You know the difference.

... Like Mexico.  Or Jamaica.  Or New York, even.

Money does not matter.  I do not care how much you earn.  I'd just like you to be a little happier in your work, but beyond that you can do what you like.

But what?

Yeah, you're alright.  But you're certainly not happy.  So what happens if you get happy?  And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable?  What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend?

Hi.

Just local, of course.

Barry said its done.

I'm sorry I've been acting like a jerk.  I do appreciate what you've done for me, and I know you've done it for the best possible reasons, and I do love you, even though I act like I don't.

Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo.

No.  Probably not.

No.  I don't think so.  I'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days. Fair enough?

I'm an idiot.  I should have played the record first.  This place is about to get burned down.

Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like...

What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.

The Conformist.

Tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees Rob, standing and holding his jacket.

Would you like me to turn the lights out?  Or would you like them on?

Great.  Super-fantastic.

So so.  Up and down.

You know that's not what's upsetting me.

What do you think?

These are worth at least, I don't know --

I warned you.

Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born.

Would you remember his name?

It's not mine.

I don't know what you're talking about.

You have an active imagination.

I have friends.

He called you "MacLeod".

He sees me as a threat.

What's all that?

No.  So what now?  We just wait?

Here, try this.  I suppose they're still making women the same as back then.

I hope I never get that old.

He is older than I.

Sometimes I think it's just for something to do.  A conquest to be the last.  Something to hold onto while everything else around you withers and blows away.  Some- thing to replace the love that can never work.

Perhaps.  There is something more. An inheritance.

I didn't kill the watchman.

Don't.

What is it?

Get out.

Forget it.

You've been a busy little beaver. Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill.  Your notes are very complete. Naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew.  In fact, we're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder.

Just for laughs we raided wonder boy's house.  There was a gallon of one of the corpse's blood in his carpet.  I think it was about then I withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year.

You talked to your supervisor lately?  He's burning up the place about you just dropping out of sight.  That on top of the cops bugging him.

Corey, you _owe_ me.

Good way to lose your job.

Who is it?

Hang on a sec, you did your little favor for the boys downtown, I'm sure your uncle and the rest are perfectly capable of taking it from here.

Afternoon.

I haven't much to offer, Mr. Romirez from Spain, but you're welcome to what's here.

I did at that.

I was driven out.

How can you know this?

Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?

It is as you are.

Aye.

Why?

What is the fascinatioon?  It is only a leaf.

It does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds.  But the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening. For it gives you great strength.  The strength of _knowledge_.  The ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be.

I am a small player.  But if by helping you I can keep that monster from being the last, then perhaps my life has meant something.

My future husband died in battle against the Sutherlands.

Something pretty.

Who am I deceiving?

Romirez understood.  Not you.

You see Major?  You are not so different...

Are you sure?

He got him.  He always does.  Eventually.

And have you something to settle with me?

But then rides up Pope Pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross, climbs off his papal horse, draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on.  And what did Neuvich, dear dear drunken Neuvich do?

The pressure only comes when you let the taste slip into your mouth.

Long time.

Tradition.

Perhaps Miss Cartwright would like to play.

Two days ago a Bulgarian national was murdered the same way.  He'd also been in the country less than a week.  What is your citizenship?

Do you know what this is?

A claymore to be exact.  You wouldn't know anything about it would you?

Ah Steven, it is good to see you.

The resemblance is amazing.

Nothing -- ah -- detrimental, I hope.

I won't be more than ten minutes, I promise you.

Say, what's happened to Burns? He looks sunk, doesn't he?

For a minute, I thought maybe Walter Burns was at the back of it. But then I realized he couldn't have been.

Did you finish the interview?

Hildy!

I know I got you into this, Hildy, but it does seem to me that you can't care much for me if you're willing to let me stay locked up for two hours.

Here it is, Bruce. One -- two -- three -- four hundred -- and fifty dollars.

But I see, she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?

I know I wasn't a good husband, Hildy, but you can always count on me.

Just for the first year.

I feel I ought to take care of her.

Well, I'm independent, too.

Gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you.

Well, I got to get back. You can find your way out, can't you?

No -- I was just talking to one of the guys at the office. 

If you've any accusations to make, Hartman, make them in the proper manner. Otherwise, I'll have to ask you to get out.

I can explain that, Hartman. When Hildy told me she wanted to interview Earl Williams I thought it might be dangerous and I gave her a gun to defend herself.

I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this.

What about this, Burns? Kidnapping, eh?

You're going to be in office for exactly two days more and then we're pulling your nose out of the feed bag.

I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you.

Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's what divorces are for.

Well, go on and take it. Work for somebody else! That's the gratitude I get for --

What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism! I took a little doll-faced mugg --

I made a great reporter out of you, Hildy, but you won't be half as good on any other paper, and you know it. You need me and I need you -- and the paper needs both of us.

Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!

Sweeney.

That's why I'm quitting. I want to go some place where I can be a woman.

A journalist! Peeking through keyholes -- running after fire engines -- waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think Hitler's going to start a war -- stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen! I know all about reporters -- a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets, and for what? So a million hired girls and motormen's wives will know what's going on! No, Walter, I'm through.

Then what does he want with you?

And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her!

I suppose I can't call this off without creating a scene -- but remember, it's your last fling.

Well, I'll tell you one thing, old man, she never looked at me the way she's looking at you.

Why, Walter, you're getting poetic!

What do you mean, only an act? Haven't you got any feeling?

You'll get it. Now what's the story?  I'll have the paper send the money right down to you. I swear it on my mother's grave.

Well, I'm coming to it. It seems the Professor had to have a gun to re- enact the crime with -- and who do you suppose supplied it? Nobody else but that great thinker, Sheriff Hartman!

Get Bruce out of jail! How can you worry about a man who's resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on? Hildy, this is war! You can't desert now!

You've kicked over the whole City Hall like an apple-cart. You've got the Mayor and Hartman backed against a wall. You've put one administration out and another in. This isn't a newspaper story -- it's a career! And you stand there belly-aching about whether you catch an eight o'clock train or a nine o'clock train! Still a doll-faced mugg! That's all you are.

Not if he's inside the desk. We'll carry the desk over.  Give me Duffy!

All the words you've got.

Listen, did you impress it on Butch that I want him and his gang here right away? You did? Every minute counts. All right.  Duffy's getting old!

Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, you're not trying anything again, are you?

Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?

What are you doing there? Haven't you even started?

Ring that number, will you?

Hello -- hello! Is this the Lying -- In Hospital? Did you have an auto accident in the last --

No, you don't! Walter!

No!

Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?

Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee.

Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.

Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.

Well -- what is it?

Hildy!

Then why are you doing it?

What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting for you in Albany.

Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.

Sure, it was good -- it was wonderful! Only you expected it to be like other marriages. It can't be like other marriages -- we're different! We're a different world. Look at what we went through today. I wouldn't trade that for any honeymoon in the world. I bet you wouldn't, either.

Sure I do. And I'll tell you something else -- I'd like a baby.

It'll be Heaven!

He's on my phone. He just called me.

They're always after me for interviews.

Of course, I sort of promised them I would give out a statement when I got through here. You don't mind?

So -- now I say to you: 'Earl Williams, you are under arrest!' and you point your gun at me.

Hey!

Better let us in on it, Mollie.

You guys wanna play some more poker?

No, I tell you! Nobody knows where he got it.

Say, Hildy, if I know you, you sound pretty anxious to get rid of us. Are you trying to scoop us or something?

We know what you're up to.

Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. And coffee.

Same way you did.  Through that gate.

Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --

Johnson, I'm going to the bottom of this. What do you know about Williams? Are you going to talk or aren't you?

He went over to the hospital to call on Professor Egelhoffer.

A fine fair-weather friend you are!

After all I've done for you --

Where is he?

I'm Sheriff Hartman. You want me?

Just one second --

Pete, I want to talk to you!

Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my Sentimental side.

Pure politics!

Dementia praecox Oh-h-h!

We'll fix that, too. 

All right. Tell 'em to shoot to kill.

Take those handcuffs off our friends, Pete. That wasn't at all necessary.

Fine, thanks, Sheriff.

All right. You can't. But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs. And we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it!

You can let him out on bail, can't you?

You'll take fifty and like it!

We run smack into a police patrol. You know what I mean? We broke it in half!

Search me! When I come to I was running down Thirty-fifth Street.

Nobody's going to rush me into anything!  You keep away from me! 

Gentlemen of the Press! Always picking on somebody who can't defend himself -- the littler the better.

Hello, Mr. Burns. Yes, she's still here.

You fight it cut.

Say, I've been a reporter twenty years and never heard any hooey like that. Where'd you get it?

Have you got my dough?

Come on with that money!

Here!

Hildy, I thought you were gone --

Mother!

They're very simple. I believe in the Golden Rule. I'm not the first man to die for preaching it. But if they would only listen to it -- we could have a fine, decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things.

Don't forget about production for use.

You're not going to shoot me, Earl. I'm your friend, remember? I've got to write that story about your "Production for Use".

Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.

I don't blame you, Earl.  If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either.

How much do you make a week? What's your salary?

Who? Me?

Pinkus.

Is it hard?

Here's the picture of my wife.

Well, well -- Miss Mollie Malloy.

There she is!

Williams put up a desperate struggle but the police overpowered --

Never let a rat creep up on you.

What are you doing here? This is our territory

The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.

He's never going to come back. He's gone off to be a soldier and Mummy doesn't even know.

You wouldn't.

Tell them about Pauline's mum.

Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.

Who pays for them?

It was great for me, how was it for you.

Well. Now we can do it slow. Are those some kind of stockings you're wearing?

Boy, that was some air-raid.

You expect me to spend the rest of the war sitting at home staring at a ring? And you'll meet some French girl who can speak your own language. No thank you!

...It was a toss-up. His company went to India, mine went to France. Flip of a coin.

And Jim.

Root it out Clive... the thought of it, before it takes hold.

What about it?

You always were, Clive. Steady the Buffs.

No Turks.

And what's that?

We don't know anything about it

Well?

Taste it. Why don't you taste it?

You mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission?

When do you think you'll get leave again?

He always knows.

What would we do if a German came into the house?

And where do you think you're going?

I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.

Now take deep breaths, and push.

Is it peace in out time?

Bless you, Mac. What would I have done without you?

God, how I hate all this scrimping and squalor.

Whoa, thanks for stopping. I been standing out there in that toad strangling rain for like a hundred million years.

I agree.

I'll cut your fucking tits off and shove 'em down your throat.

Come on, ma... this bitch's got it coming.

Who's your Daddy!

Hey, um...  ...what kind of animal is that?

I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.

He walks, duh.

Why? You gonna do something about it?

How long have you been running this place?

No, really.

You see me and my friends are writing a book on offbeat roadside attractions. You know all the crazy shit you see when you drive cross country.

She's pretty cute.

I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.

Hold on, I've heard this before... but I can't remember the end.

I dunno... we'll ask around as we get closer. Man, I really don't want to run out of gas out here in the middle of Petticoat Junction, man.

It's a hitchhiker.

Almost there.

I like sleep.

Fuck! We are fucked!

What's he so excited about?

Fine. I'll go straight.

Come on, get with the facts.

Goddamn.

You sure you don't need any help in there?

Great, you're back. Let's go. We already paid for the tickets.

This isn't everything. Get ready for this... there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem.

Hey, maybe she knows where this is?

So.

Why?

So what?

She said we look like pussy lickers or some shit like that.

How long has it been?

Jesus Christ.

Excuse me, may I please use your phone?

Holy Jesus, somebody had themselves a field day beating the shit outta this thing.

That's the understatement of the year.

Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone.

Bye sweety, we could of been great together.

I'll go. It's my fault.

That stupid hillbilly slut.

Hold on, hold on! Everybody calm down! It's the tow truck guy.

Where's Bill?

Where is he?

Please, just a minute.

Think... do any of these kids look familiar in any way?

Yeah, I hear it... where's it coming from?

What about the body you found?

You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.

Hulk was dumb as shit.

That is the wrong fork, young man.  Harold, tell the boy.

And?

Tell him, Harold.

Tell him, Harold.

I don't know why you didn't tell me about this.

It's not so bad.  So, it just keeps growing?

Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked.

Oh, Hi, Gabrielle.

No. Don't be. I really enjoy hearing that. You're a terrific assistant.

Thank you so much for accompanying me.

I have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man... but I'm talking too much again, no?

I am sleepy.

So soft. So smooth.  I'm sorry. It's just...

Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please.  Lila.

Gabby, what is it?

I love you so much, Gabrielle.

Yeah? What?

Like what?

That's not how he tells it.

I want our boy back.

A little resistance would be nice, damn it.

My apologies, madam.

It shan't happen again. I swear it. I'm just getting my sea legs, you know.

No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail.

Progress!

You still in the market for a real boy?

I don't get that. Is that sexual?

Handsome, thirties, psychologist...

Somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine. Mr. handsome, animal- loving psychologist said he would love to meet you.

My brother says the guy's a thirty- five year old virgin, so maybe he won't know how women usually feel. Plus he's got bad eyesight, almost legally blind, which is helpful in this situation. Plus he's got an extremely small penis, of which he is "mortifyingly ashamed", so chances are he'll be so grateful for any non- judgmental attention, that he'll be yours forever.

Rose, please go away.

Done!

I love that you said that. It makes me feel a bit lighter. I've been rather heavy lately. Thinking about my childhood. Realizing how much a product I am of my upbringing.  I've been seeing someone. A therapist.

I hope you don't think me daft. It's important work. It's part of a larger sociological experiment. I'm federally funded.

The truth is most people don't have table manners today. And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear, civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels.

No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.

You do?

You do?

Actually, Mother and Father, you look very, very old. You look terrible.

It'll be wonderful! I'll show you my old stomping grounds!

Darling, did you bring the insect repellent lotion?

What SPF, sweetie?

You'll catch cold. It's cold.  What do you suppose he is, a survivalist?

Actually, I just had an amusing thought.

It's perfect!

What are you doing in there?

It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help it. I'm sorry.

Really? Wow! That's that's terrific to hear from someone so... feminine, so female.

Do you like my new look?

Really?

That's great. It's a great color for you.

You remember that from my book? I'm touched!  What's wrong?

Yes! And I want to help. You won't have to pay me, and I was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway.

Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because...

So he's doing okay?

I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair!

Aha! Finally. I've covered almost the entire seaboard and parts of eastern Ohio.

I bow to your expertise in these matters.

I trust that you'll make good, mature decisions. I trust that you'll do the proper thing.

Thanks to you, Nate.

Look, why don't you and Lila stay here and have your natural life. I'll just go on my way. You'll never see me again.

No, why?

I love Lila. I mean, she's a wonderful person. And... she loves me! That's no small potatoes. I mean she really loves me. She's sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me. And she's a good person. A truly good person. How rare is that in this world, eh? And how could I stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection, if it can even be called that. I mean, God knows I'm not perfect! What about my eyesight? It's lousy, that's what! Lila's not going to leave me because of my eyesight. What about my penis?

Yes.

Boys just passing through?

Pittsburgh?

Thanks. Sure is a hot day for driving. Late afternoon is better. You guys have plenty of time. Make Pittsburgh in two, maybe three hours.

Hey, another one for me and another one for the lady.

Doesn't your lighter work, Mr. Gordon?

And a fact is a fact.

Oh, wait a minute, Miss Packard.

I want to talk to you.

All right. Today for me, tomorrow for himself.

Will you take a check, Bert?

Bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.

Character.

Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota Fats again.

Look, you wanna hustle pool, don't you? This game isn't like football. Nobody pays you for yardage. When you hustle you keep score real simple. The end of the game you count up your money. That's how you find out who's best. That's the only way.

What happened? Somebody step on your hands?

Man named Turk Baker?

Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays.

What happened to you anyway?

Thinking about what?

Fats knew the game was in the clutch, knew he had to do something to stop ya. He played it smart.

Well, we won't.

Sure.

When do I raise the bet?

Eddie?...  YOU OWE ME MONEY!

Well, here it's half.

So you figure you're still my manager, huh?

Fifty per cent?

The expensive kind.

Ah, get with it, will ya, Charlie?

Twenty-five hours, Eddie. Twenty- five hours you been playin' straight.

Is this all we got left?

What kind of life have you got here? Scufflin' around the small rooms, picking up eight, ten bucks a day?

Are you figuring on going back to Ames to play Minnesota Fats again? Is that what's on your mind?

This boy's crazy. They wiped the floor with him. They beat his brains out and he wants to go back.  What for? To take another beating?

And I you.  I think I've heard about you, Mr. Felson. You play pocket billiards, don't you?

What time?

You gentlemen care for a drink?

I thought we came here to play pool.

Yeah, I'll play you a couple. Just for kicks.

Try me.

Okay, friend. You're on.

You better not miss, friend.

You quittin', friend?

Yours.

Can I sit down?

It's the lights. And the scotch.

I know where you live: in a locker, in a bus station. What's it like living in a locker?

Do you always ask so many questions?

No, I didn't mean that -- whatever that means. I mean, you just don't look young enough.

What do you do on the other days?

I could always get us a bottle.

Why?

Oh, you need a shave. You mustn't go looking like that. There's a razor and shaving cream in the bathroom. Compliments of the house.

I lied. When I'm drunk I lie.

You know, I've been living here for almost three years. Now in three days it seems as if I know everybody. When I pass people on the street I want to stop and say, "Listen, I got a fella."

Oh, stop talking about yourself like you're a lush or something. I don't like it.  Maybe you ought to go to a clinic, get some treatments.

What did all this stuff cost you?

Do you want me to go?

Who is it?

No. You?

Yeah. I met this guy -- Gordon, Bert Gordon. He said I was. Born loser.

You know, someday, Sarah, you're gonna settle down. You're gonna marry a college professor, and you're gonna write a great book. Maybe about me, huh? Fast Eddie Felson, hustler.

Sherry.  Very old, very dry.

What do you want to tell me?

For how long?

A week? A year?

No, I want to walk.

Where do you come from?

Boy, he is great! Jeez, that old fat man. Look at the way he moves. Like a dancer.

That's what the game's all about.

You want to find them.

What choice did I have -- ?!

Will you keep feeding me?  How long can you live like that?  Until it kills you?  Until I kill you? Without your blood I'll go back.

Shhh... don't talk.

Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?

So, what do you do?

I know, son.  But you'll like it where we're going.  I'm getting a good job.  It's a pretty part of the country.

Wow.  There's the town.  And there's the air base.  This is a great hill.

Which one's that?  The dull, red one.

I lost it.  It's kind of muddy out there.

I had an awful dream.

Better get some sleep, son, or you'll be pretty tired at school tomorrow.

Why not?  Moving is hard for anybody.  Was it hard for you to leave all your friends?

That's quite a story.  You know that, don't you?

Where, Jimmy?

Does it look to you like anything landed here?

No one comes here after dark.

Don't go in.

Well, come on, you two.  Time to go to bed.

What do you think he saw?  Could it have been something from the air base?

Your father asked you a question.

Hi.  Sorry I'm late.

Mom.  I gotta talk to you.

When?

What's his family background?

This could be our last night on Earth. I don't want to die a virgin.

In case you haven't noticed, we're in a little bit of a crisis here.

Better be. You left me for him.

With you? I don't understand why you can't just show someone how to plant the virus, somebody trained for this kind of mission?

There's good news and bad news.

You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.

What're you talking about?

Tell her to get the kids and leave town.

Okay, why did I just send my family to Atlanta?

You still got the Olds?

You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything.

You try Martin?

Yes. I can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the White House.

You punched the President in the face?

I have a confession to make. I'm not real big on flying.

Get us out of here!

Nice meeting you.

Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?

Where are they?

And our forces?

Grey, you read me?

He's trying to impress you.

Before we do this, I want you to know I'm sorry.

You scared the hell out of me.

Jasmine has this thing for dolphins. I had them make it...

Jimmy, kick it! They're gaining.

Stevie... I can't...

I couldn't find anything. Everyone is packing up, they're leaving. Word is a space ship is heading this way.

I want the Vice President, Secretary of Defense, the whole Cabinet and the Joint Chiefs taken to a secured location. I'm staying here. I am not going to add to a public hysteria that could cost lives.

I spoke with the Joint Chief when they arrived at NORAD. They agree, we must launch a counter offensive with a full nuclear strike. Hit 'em with everything we've got.

Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?

Call them back.

Why did you people come here?

Oh, what?... your servant, sir.

My reputation precedes me.

All my life!

Your treat.

What has the old fool got himself into now?

Marcus -- I've seen this window before.

Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!

Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. Here. He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains. Here. Straight to the canyon. He knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city.

Yes. Now we know.

Henry! What are you doing here?!

The Word of God...

Schneider?

Are you expected?

This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.

"Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever."

I'm through!

My dad sent me this Diary for a reason. Until we find out why, I suggest we keep it to ourselves.

It must be one of these...

Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?

This one. I think he's in here.

This book contained a map -- a map with no names -- precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.

How did you get here?

All I have to do is squeeze.

Elsa! Elsa, don't move!

It's important!

I'll never forgive myself --

No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got to get out of here.

Dad, they come in through the doors.

Found it.

I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.

Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place?  So it wouldn't fall into their hands!!

She ransacked her own room and I fell for it. How did you know she was a Nazi?

How did you she was a Nazi?

And the chair.

Dad!

Oh, yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.

Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.

Well, I'm as human as the next man.

We didn't talk. We never talked.

Nice landing.

You're strangely dressed... for a knight.

My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?

Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me!

And why were you trying to kill me?

Captain Blumburtt and his troops are here to check up on the "natives".

I believe we're being called to dinner.

They will escort you to your rooms now. You will be provided with fresh clothes. Tonight you will be dining with His Highness.

I had a question, Mr. Prime Minister. I was examining some of the Maharajah's artifacts.

You know the villagers also claimed that this palace stole something from them.

So, it is true, Dr. Jones? You found Nurhachi?

You have insulted my son.

Wow! Holy smoke! Crash landing!

You got the tickets, Short Round?

Indy, they make our plane crash? To get you here?

Slow on the curves or we'll fly off the tracks!

They dig for the gems to support our cause. They also search for the last two stones. Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful!

That's far enough!

But why would the Maharajah take this sacred stone?

Look out, damn it, I need that antidote!

So, what're you supposed to be, a lion tamer?

You all right?

God, I am starving, but I can't eat this...

And then they took their children.

What?!

Don't let it curl around you!

Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.

What about the future?

I'd like to find one of those myself.

Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years.  Fortune and glory...

Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes...

A fulcrum release lever!

There's a hole! I found a square hole!

What is it...?

Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!

I can't!

Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond.

This is the first time anybody ever cried when I left.

No, not her. Me.

Where are we? We're on the street. We're walking down the street. We're talking to ourselves. People are staring at us.

Somebody's been here.

Yeah...Who?

Are you threatening me?

Yeah. What did you do? You explain it. ...why I'm not at the lab right now, in my tube, with my crew. Explain that!

The Nicholson Node. I suppose you haven't heard of that either.

Behind us?

Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you.

Sue them.

Black suits and helmets.

That's not a good idea.

You need ID in there?

I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home.

Anything...A feeling...a smell..?

What is it?

Who?...  Wait a minute! I'm no agent, secret or otherwise. And..I'm alone.

Now what?

Eat it?

I don't want to eat it.

Beautiful!

Where is she staying?

You really like that shirt?

Mind your own business.

What did that cost?

Get close to them.

Who are they? Stay on them, will you. How can we find out...Wait. The glasses.

Voice stress analyzer.

You're doing great with her.

What is it?

Where are you going?

Relax. Make your mind a blank.

Don't touch a thing.

What are you doing?

I don't trust her.

He aready made the deal..

Dieter!

I can always flush you down the toilet.

She works for them.

She is beautiful.

Awwww...

In a way, we're like brothers... I can't have her. I want you to.

I've got twenty hours left. I could die in here. And you're falling in love.

You just got a Mickey.

Can you fly this?

I'm...scared.

What kind of a deal?

I knew he was following us. He diverted attention, exposed Ryuji's trap..

Me.

PEM115!

Enough ROmance.

Now remember, your short term memory may have been affected.

Fine. You look fine.

Home. Your home. The address on your form.

Ahhh...nothing.

Was quite excited, when he came in...

Don't do it!

What did you say?

What?

Is someone else here?

And you?

You again.

I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask?

That was then. This is now. Who am I talking to?

No. Ryuji just hires us.

Your friends, did they ask about me?

What did you tell them?

I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.

We're very close.

A chip. Goes in a computer.

Hiroshima.

You don't believe me.

Then why are you smiling like that?

What's Gruner like?

Where we going?

What?

Now what?

What?

That's not this direction. It's back the other way.

I know the territory.

So do I.

What?

Don't worry.

You son of a bitch! You conned me!

He can't help us.

It wasn't me. It was him.

I can't. He didn't do anything. Thanks to you.

Joe Doakes? It's quarter to 10...

It's alright.

It will be fine. You have another.

Could I have it, please.

It will.

Yeah? What for?

That's great... Little early for cartoons, isn't it?

He's into kind of little cars, that...

Mom.

Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?

And it's bullshit. And if I'm right, are you going to put the Journal's reputation behind a story that's going to blow up in your face?

Are you all right?

These are their leads, their sources. I want you to have your reporters...

Shit...

I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.

Yeah, I heard rumors.

Are you suggesting that she and Eric are influenced by money?

CBS does not do that. And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?!

What the hell are you doing?

No, not that. I'm talking about the Associated Press. They got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to Mike and I. Did you tell them that we were lying?

How prominent? What kind of placement?

You ready...?

What do you need at the store?

Right now?

Why? Who said?

There's a severance agreement... It includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage...  Sure you don't need anything?

What's going on?

I don't think I can do this... I want to stand by my husband... I really do, Jeffrey. But I don't think I can do this anymore. I am so sorry...

No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with "60 Minutes"...

Oh, someone took a poll? "Are all things Canadian boring...?"

Is it too late?

Area code 212-555-0199.

Yeah, I'm here.

...I'd be lying to you if I did not tell you how important it was in the court of public opinion...

...come in earlier on Mike's Marine barracks line when he's talking to Sheikh Mussawi...

So, is everything okay?

It went great in Mississippi, Mike.

I discovered this. SEC filing...  For the sale of the CBS Corporation to Westinghouse Corporation.

Did I get you up?

Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path. To show me the way.

C'mon, it all worked out. You came out okay in the end...

Please to explain, why I should agree to interview... with pro-Zionist American media?

Tell him I will see him day after tomorrow.

Who's that?

Look, I really don't have that much time...

Did work.

Should I just take the documents now?

C'mere. I want to talk to you.

How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...?

You came all the way down here to tell me that?

And, I'm unemployed. So I have to protect my medical coverage.  ...so I left them a message this morning. Their expanded confidentiality agreement? I will sign it.

Talk to me outside the zone of your agreement?

Like where'd you work before Brown & Williamson?

Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?

...okay.

Next to your father?

Why?

I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have.  I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake...  I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's.  I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!

I believe that? Yes, I believe that.

Are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here?! I never abandoned a source!

Excuse me. Yeah...

Jeff, call the FBI right away...

Jeff...

Liane, this is a preliminary...  You didn't tell her we were taping? What did she think she was coming to New York for?

Yes. Did you lie about being on the American Judo Team in the Olympics?

Some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interview... where you're saying you were on the American Judo Team in the Olympics...?

ABC Telemarketing Company.

That's not the fucking point, whether you told the truth or not! Hello...?

I've got to teach class. I've got to go. I've got to teach class.

You manipulated me into this...!

I think I need to call the police. He won't respond...

What's happening?!

Alright, now listen to me. I want you -- I want you to tell him, in these words: get on the fucking phone...!

We have a couple. One's hers, one's mine. Everybody uses a different name.  Modern marriage.  How's Liane?

What do you mean there is no family?

And, so, I moved out... I see the girls a couple of days a week...

Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out...  However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order...

You heard Mr. Sandefur say before Congress that he believed nicotine was not addictive...?

All of us did. There was this whole line of people... whole line of CEOs up there all swearing.

And that's what cigarettes are for...?

A delivery device for nicotine. Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix...

Object to the form of the question!

Dr. Wigand. I am instructing you...  ...not to answer that question in accordance to the terms of the contractual obligations undertaken by you not to disclose any information about your work at the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company. And in accordance with the force and effect of the temporary restraining order that has been entered against you to by the court in the State of Kentucky! That means you don't talk!  Mr. Motley, we have rights, here...

My co-counsel, Ron Motley, and I have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the State of Mississippi to get the state reimbursed Medicaid costs for treating people with smoking-related illness.  If you'd be interested in talking to us, we'd certainly like to talk to you...

"Research..."  You declare, as a badge of honor, you don't even know what makes water boil...

Miles, how nice of you to see us -- may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of Doyle Oil.

Baby. You are so HOT!

And how is Mrs. Reiser?

So she's uh, flourishing?

I'd just like to have a word with her.

Excuse me?

Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.

Is this Mr. Dumbarton?

Objection, Your Honor. This isn't about Mrs. Rexroth's filial obligations.

Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.

I'm happy for you, pal.

You like kids.

It was like that scene in The Godfather. Frankie Pentangeli is called to testify against the Family. And he's in court, and he looks into the spectators gallery, and sees his Brother. They brought the brother from Sicily. And Frankie can't say a word. He can't testify. That's what it was like seeing Pat in there. I couldn't even have Ruth cross examine her.

You're vulnerable.

Is Tong older than Ming?

Not yet.

Tell me Mr. Massey. What was your performance about this afternoon?

"Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?"

No. You listen to me.  You busted me, Miles. You left me with nothing! What did you expect me to do? Get a degree in counseling? Write a book about table linen? Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I'm not quite ready for that.

Hello?

Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and pick up a blended for --

Hmmm...

I have to say -- I'm speechless. No. I'm never speechless.

No ma'am. I have been asleep all my life up to this moment. Marylin, will you marry me?

I'm sorry. I'm squishing you. I'll move to the...

Good.  Are those foods?

Miles? You're scaring me.

I don't believe you have "things."

Drop the bogus forgery charge and I'll forget about your generous friends slash clients.

Wait! He works for YOU?

But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.

Income tax evasion?

Sweet.

Rex. Get away from the door.

Forgery and Fraud?

She's a legend. Didn't she do Kravis or a Pearlman? She definitely did a Factor.

Who's she?

Please. I'm not seeing anyone until this is over. One husband at a time.

You're not...

Sarah Sorkin. Ramona Barcelona -- this is Miles Massey.

Is this Ming?

-- is not a challenge. I need something I can sink my teeth into, professionally speaking.

Yes, I know Howard Doyle.

So, Miles. If you have a proposal, let's hear it.

-- So much for the icebreakers. What're you after, Ruth?

Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why not ask for a hundred percent?

Why not a hundred and fifty percent?

Did Marylin end up with money?

Where does that leave us?

Mr. Rexroth.

Time marches on. Ardor cools.

Ah.

Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?

...and I hear she's richer than Croesus.

She owes me a meal.

Wrigley?

Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.

And how would you define your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You know -- you are her...?

Hi, Sweetie.

No. I haven't. But I've been out of town.  Hello, Rex. Hello there.

Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?

Thorstenson Gieselensen. He just separated from his third. He's in fish. He is fish.

No. He's been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started. He can't even get a phone call we don't know about.

OhMary

I was surprised to get your note. My daughter hadn't told me anything about you. About your helping her.

I sold some drawers and socks, too; I'm throwing those in.

Why not? I'm not charging you for the time I wasted.

All I want is thirty-nine sixty. If you'll give me a check I'll get out of this place. It gives me the jitters.

I might.

Come on, Ellie. Stop being silly. You know I'm going to have my way.

You ought to know why. Because

You can't tempt me.  Do you hear? I won't eat!

What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married!

You talk as if he were a gigoloor something.

I knocked several times.

Ridiculous!

Well, under the circumstances, don't you think we ought to call this thing off?

We ain't ate nothin' since yestidday.

Okay! Okay! Keep your shirt on, young feller. 

The papers! The papers! Whadda you mean throwin' 'em out!

That's a long story, my friend. You see, I don't like sitting on newspapers. I did once and all the headlines came off on my white pants.

Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.

Oh, yeah?

Driver!

That storm sure made a mess outa these roads.

I beg your pardon!

Tell that man not to drive so fast. 

No. I'd rather you didn't.

I don't want it reported!

Don't tell me you did it on my account!  hope you're not getting any idea that what happened last night is  You needn't concern yourself about me, young man. I can take care of myself.

My ticket?

You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.

What for?

I never thought of that.

Here, boy!

Your ego is colossal.

Thank you.  My, my! Scrambled eggs.

Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don't see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary, I've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man!

KingKing Westley was in it.

Yeah. I got a letter from Aunt Betty. She says if we don't stop over at Wilkes-Barre she'll never forgive us.

Don't get excited, Peter. They just asked a civil question.

Oh, so now I was drunk!

I'm sorry I didn't take another sock at him.

Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have frightened him like that.

I was never built for these moonlight strolls.  Why did we have to leave the bus?

Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene.

Aren't you afraid of me?

You're crazy.

I don't think there's a "piggy- back" rider in your whole family. I never knew a rich man yet who was a good "piggy-back" rider.

I'll get my clothes all wrinkled.

What!

What are you thinking about?

Really?

There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast.

Something must have gone wrong. I guess I'll try number two.

You! Don't make me laugh.

Oh, Peter! What happened? Are you all right?

I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed.

You're forgetting you're married.

Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely.

Whatever you say, darling.

No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too.

Why, you can't put me out in the middle of the

Up yonder. See the lights?

Free verse, huh?  What the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more.

Get out of here!

Joe, listen

A thousand dollars!  Get out of this office before I throw you out bodily.

If it's on the level.

Who's she gonna marry?

I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk.

Who's the guy she's gonna marry?

Now I know you're drunk.  I'm going home. Don't annoy me any more.

I met her on a bus coming from Miami. Been with her every minute.  I'm in love with her, Joe.

Listen, manI'll tell you what I'll do. When I come back in the morning, I'll buy it back from you and give you ten dollars profit? What do you say?

Well, you're two up on me now. 

What's the idea?

If you wanna get anywhere nowadays, you gotta keep in touch with all the news, is what I always say.

It's a lotta dough. If I was to run across that dame, you know what I'd do?

Cause I'm a guy that don't believe in hoggin' it, see?  A bird that figures that way winds up behind the eight ball,[10] is what I always say.

Five G'sor I crab the works.

What else, stupid! You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you?  Ten thousand bucks? Chicken feed! We're holding her for a million smackers.

What's the matter with you! Gettin' yellow?

Where do you live?

You love them, don't you?

You'll keep your trap shut, all right.

Oh, thanks, thanks, Mister. I always knew you guys were kind-hearted.

If this is Oswald, it must be our third Oswald.

William Walter, the night clerk on duty here in the FBI office, gave me a copy of this.  It went all over the country.  Nothing was done, and the motorcade went ahead on schedule - and this wasn't even mentioned in the Warren Report!  Read it, Al.

Gentlemen, I will not hear this.  I value Bill as much as anyone here.  We all need to make room for someone else's ideas, Lou, especially me. Maybe Oswald is what everyone says he is and I'm just plain dumb wrong.

Why you keep dancing on my head for, my man?  We been thicker'n molasses pie since law school.

Yeah, she was pretty, all right, but not half as cute as you, Deano.  You shoulda tried a legitimate line of business.

Street cats?

What was his voice like?

Recall any names?

All this blubbering over that sonofabitch!  They're grieving like they knew the man.  It makes me want to puke.

Who'd ever thought that goofy Oswald kid would pull off a stunt like an assassination?  Just goes to show, you can never know about some people.  Am I right, Jack?  Well, bless my soul.  Your eyes are as red as two cherries, Jack.  Don't tell me we have another bleeding heart here.  Hell, all these years I thought you were on my side.

Maybe there's more to this, Susie. The CIA's keeping something from our enemies.

It's you I want to talk to, Bill.

What do you think, Lou?

Clay Bertrand?  Sure I know him.  He comes around the Quarter.

Fuck, yes.  Hell, I'm already in jail.  I got no reason to lie to you.  I ain't no nigger.

Morning, boys.  Ready for a walking tour?

And the six of us, with almost no budget and in secret, are going to solve the case that the Warren Commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldn't solve.  We can't keep up with the crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.

I'm lost, boss.  What are we saying here?

I don't doubt their involvement, Bill, but at a low level.  Could the Mob change the parade route, Bill, or eliminate the protection for the President?  Could the Mob send Oswald to Russia and get him back?  Could the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and the Dallas Police to make a mess of the investigation?  Could the Mob appoint the Warren Commission to cover it up?  Could the Mob wreck the autopsy?  Could the Mob influence the national media to go to sleep? And since when has the Mob used anything but .38's for hits, up close? The Mob wouldn't have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude.  Assassins need payrolls, orders, times, schedules.  This was a military-style ambush from start to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson waiting in the wings.

I know this, Bill - Lyndon Johnson got $1 billion for his Texas friends, Brown and Root, to dredge Cam Ranh Bay for the military in Vietnam. That's just for openers.

Can you ascertain if there's Proloid in his system?

Well, it doesn't make sense, Nick - he was afraid of dying, then he kills himself in a way that leaves no trace, but he leaves two unsigned suicide notes.

...Oswald?

...did you ever use the alias Clay Bertrand?

You still questioning any Cubans?

Oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing...  the storm wasn't that bad.

In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.

I don't know.  Were you?  Who you scared of, Dave?

Did you take a good look at the TV when they had Oswald?

I'm going to have to ask the jury to leave the courtroom.

That's our case!

Because of Kennedy?  Are the same people gonna kill us, Daddy?

I'm scared.

...you heard echoes.

We have that taken care of.  You only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this. No one, you hear?

Don't get sidetracked!  How does he get back to the States?  That's the point.  Does he have any problems?

None either.  It's bizarre.  It's next to impossible to get Russian sweethearts out.  Nor does Lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to Cuba and Russia in '63.  A man who has defected once already.  It's crazy.

The next thing we know he's living in Dallas/Ft. Worth in October '62 working 6 months at Jaggars-Chiles- Stovall, a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the U.S. Army... He starts work only days before the government reveals Russian missiles in Cuba and the crisis explodes.  Oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the U2 planes and works alongside a young man who'd been in the Army Security Agency.

All I can find out about the Williams' is their tax returns are classified and that Bill Williams, a descendant of the Cabots of Massachusetts, has links through his family and United Fruit to the CIA and does classified work for Bell Helicopter which requires a security clearance - so what is Oswald, a defector, doing visiting his wife in his house? Williams has a relationship at Bell with General Walter Dornberger, another one of the Nazis we brought in after the War for our missile program.  He used slave labor to build the V-2 Rockets for Hitler before Bell needed him.

I don't believe it!

I'm not sure I understand.

After dinner you paid him to have sex with you.

Who?

No.  I have never known anyone by that name.  Of course never having met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have met Mr. Ferrie...

Does the name Clay Bertrand mean anything to you?

Please answer the question.

...and that this company is linked to the Schlumber tool company here in Houma, Louisiana - which is where their arms may have come from to David Ferrie and his Cubans...

One hour, y'hear?  Some Saturday night date you are.  Mama warned me this would happen if I married such a serious man.

Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake!  You going to stay up all night every night?  For what?  So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?

No.  I told you I was going to talk to Shaw.

I'm sorry, but it's important.  Clay Shaw is important.  I'm sorry.

That's not why I'm attacking him! You don't believe me - all this time you never believed me.

Willie, are you willing to repeat your statements under sodium pentothal?  Under the supervision of a doctor?

You realize the things you're saying, Willie, are going to be attacked by a lot of different people.

I know David - a strange character.

I'd say he was probably getting intelligence training.

Bill, Lou, we're standing in the heart of the United States Government's intelligence community in New Orleans.  That's the FBI there, the CIA, Secret Service, ONI.  Doesn't this seem to you a rather strange place for a Communist to spend his spare time?

They took 'em to the Sheriff's office, not the police station, and they let 'em go.  No record of them ever being questioned.

Graveyard dead.  August this year.  A single car accident on an empty road in Midlothian, Texas.  The doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died. 

That means we gotta subpoena Time- Life on it.

Chief, I've had my doubts about Bill for a long time.  He's fighting everything.

I just plain don't trust him anymore.

Hell, you're the District Attorney. You read the Warren Report - and then you tell me you're satisfied Lee Oswald shot the President all by his lonesome.

Welcome, District Attorney Garrison. May I call you Jim?

Well, thanks for coming.

It never did. 

Here's my problem, Jack.  You told me you and Guy were good friends for a long time?

Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?

Sure.  'Course they hated the sonofabitch, but...

Didn't someone say he didn't speak good Russian?

I'm glad you could find time to see me.  I flew down from Denver this morning on my private jet.

They've been enlarged and show a lot of detail...

How many men are working with you on this?

I'm going to be very frank with you. You've done a great job, an astounding job considering the limited resources available to you.  But the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot of confusion.  You're not going to do this country any good, and you're not going to do yourself any good.  You don't belong here.  On this Mickey Mouse street with that cheap strip of bail bond shops.

Virginia, you're a lucky little girl. Your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest.  Would you like to be in a beauty contest?

And you get of from school at 3 every day?

Then do you understand that I cannot tell the truth here?  In Dallas. That there are people here who do not want me to tell the truth... who do not want me to have a retrial?

But if I am eliminated there won't be any way of knowing.  Consequently a whole new form of government is going to take over this country, and I know I won't live to see you another time.  My life is in danger here. Do I sound screwy?

But then you told her you were home.

What the fuck can I say? I'm serious, man. What the fuck can I say? Thank you... thank you... thank you.

How old is that machine gun shit?

That requires me goin' out tonight?

What's the problem?

I ain't gittin' in that trunk.

Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gittin' in that trunk.

How'd you know where he was?

I'd say there's about, oh, fifty thousand dollars here. What would you say Ray?

She sound scared?

Can I have a word with you?

But now you're telling us now you do.

He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?

Are you really a bail bondsman?

That doesn't sound dark.

That's why I don't quit. If I can't fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch of a time gettin' my brand.

You know who put the dope in your bag?

What did they want to know?

I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.

No, you didn't. What branch?

'Cause if he busted you, you'd play hell bonding out of federal court. He doesn't want you mad at him, he wants you to tell him what you know. He uses you to get a line on Ordell, make a case, then take him federal. You know what Ordell's into?

You get a chance to use it?

Somebody loan it to you?

Who is this?

I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.

He told me last night.

He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?

You're gonna offer to set him up?

Really?

My ass ain't the same.

Well, hello.

I walked right past you.

Who was your girl before Annette?

Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.

He was here?

Has he hinted around?

You know some interesting people.

A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.

You do that?

You're rationalizing.

Where's the rest of it?

What if he checks it?

He's liable to shoot you.

Tell him I want to give him his money.

I got your package. It was fun getting a half-a-million dollars in the mail.

I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement.

We're partners.

If I don't cooperate?

Yes'm.

He say is a surprise.

I know what it looks like.

Look, that shit ain't mine.

Ordell has a white guy working for him named Louis.

White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's.

It was her coke I got busted with. She knows everything, but she's not part of it, and she's pissed cause she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't even let her stay at the meeting. She tried to talk me into ripping off Ordell.

That's fifty thousand, huh? It doesn't look like that much.

Ever been tempted?

What did you do after that?

We had our agent on you. She sees a blonde come out of the fitting room carrying a Robinson's/May bag and tussle with a tough-looking white guy. The white guy takes the shopping bag and they go.

We pick up Ordell. We've got three murders we can link him to. We have the storage unit where he keeps his guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search warrant to go in and get him. And we have you.

Oh, hi.

You think I'm kidding?

I put a little cherry on top. You're right. What the hell he ever do for us?

And what was your answer?

This fella Beaumont, they say what happened to him?

What do you think it is?

I understand woman, damn!

Yeah.

The Cockatoo Inn.

It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick...

You don't have to. I told 'em you're real careful. You never pick up money yourself. You always send someone, and I never know who it is.

No, I give it to someone else first.

Can you cover that?

I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.

Drink?

I was there, I saw her do it.

Who's paging you?

Want a hit?

I lived there for about nine months.

About five years ago.

Yeah, that really hit the spot.

Is it dead?

That's not what I'm saying at all.  You know where he went?

Lemme have the bag.

Goddam you. Gimme that bag,

See, what did I tell you? Man in New York wants a 9 millimeter Smith and Wesson Model 5946. Why does he want it? It's the gun that nigga on "New York Undercover" uses. Because of that nigga, I can sell it to this nigga for twelve-fifty.

Take the keys, man. Listen to music.

Louis, my man. Watcha doin'?

Whatcha watchin'?

Naw, man. I just told you, I'm comfortable. I ain't about to walk into that roach motel and get uncomfortable. You bring your ass out here.

Yeah.

I didn't look like a bum.

It's Louis.

I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.

You shot her twice?

Where did you shoot her?

Maybe forty, maybe not that much.

Louis, You tellin' me the truth?

Where you shot her.

What'd you shoot her with?

If there were nothin; in here but towels, maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and A.T.F. got it. But, she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass.

Jesus Christ.

You know who I saw in the dress department?

You know the motherfucker's a bail bondsman, don't ya? You know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell?

I'm going out for a few hours.

I'm going to Del Amo, see a movie, get something to eat.

How can I help you?

Who's it for? A relative?

Ten thousand sounds high.

Possession of unregistered machine guns.

It still sounds high.

Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out -- hey, that rhymes -- blew Beaumont's brains out.

Why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand?

You know who this is?

The bond collateral on Beaumont Livingston you moved over to cover Miss Brown, remember?

What the fuck you doin' knockin on the door like the goddamn police? You lookin' to get shot?

All I did was walk out with it.

This place stinks.

She's been there since Thursday night.

It's in the safe. She can't get at it.

I'm telling you, you got her spooked. She won't leave there till you have your money and you're gone.

Uh-huh.

It's the next street.

Get that for me, will ya baby?

We're back.

Hey, hey, hey. I think somebody's got some new clothes.

Hope you don't mind keeping him company.

He ain't here right now.

Get me out of here.

Take me home.

Go on Jake. She reads 'em like a book.

Are you all right?

Something weird is going on here. What is it about us? Even in Nam it was always weird. Are we all crazy or something?

Jesus Christ! Who's been talking to you?  What's going on? How can you just turn away?  What about the others?

Hey, wait!

Daddy, what was that noise?

I am.

It means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand.

Cars don't explode that way. Any simpleton knows that.

Dr. Carlson's dead?

Not my head, buddy. Not me. I'm gettin' a headache just listenin' to you.

Loves me!? She hasn't said a kind word about me in years!

What can I tell you, Louis? After Nam I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.

Well, I'll see what I can do about it.

What are you doing?

Are you in the service?

Yes.  I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.  It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to.

Our doctors are seen by appointment only.

What's your name?

If this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers. There's about an hour's wait. I'll be glad to take your name. Why don't you just fill out this form?

What a dream I was having. I was living with another woman ... You know who it was?

They stole it.

The room!

What happened to you?

Where'd you leave 'em?

What do you mean you can see?

Wait. Don't.

Ready?

Well, I'll miss riding home with you. I was looking forward to it.

Demons, Jake? Come on. They're winos and bag ladies. Low life. That's all they are. The streets are crawling with 'em. Don't make em into somethin' they're not.  It's the pressure, honey. That's all it is.

You okay?

Oh, come on. It's early.

We're at Della's.

What are you talking about? I'm freezing.

Look at me. I'm ice cold.

Help me! Help me!

How come? The army?

I don't know. That's all he said. He wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They chickened out, he said.

Who else were you expecting?

Where were you, Jake? Where've you been? Why haven't you called?

I want to know. You tell me!

I'm not here. You haven't seen me.

Who was that?

Bullshit!

Please.

Where have they gone?

TELL ME, DAMN YOU!

That doesn't mean shit. Where do you come from, huh? And I don't mean Indiana.

Where's West? New Jersey?

I always liked the West, west of Il- linois anyway. But you gotta give me time to pack.

Do what? I haven't done a thing.

This isn't happening.

So first I'm arrested, right? Best LSD I ever made, right down the drain. I figure this is it, twenty years in the joint, if I'm lucky. That was '68.

None of us can remember that night. I get flashes of it but they don't make sense. We saw shrinks for years. But nothing they did could ever touch it. What happened? Was there ever an offensive?

"Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil," but no one ever said I wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh?  Stick out your tongue.  That'a boy. Now why don't you just lie down and relax.

I think I'm falling asleep.

Where's Wong?

That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.

Throw that torch away, young man. Give yourself up. You're under arrest.

Clear the area. This is an order!

He's burning up.

I'll page him.

Paul! You son-of-a-bitch, how the hell are you? I haven't seen you in what, five, six, years?

Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So tell me, to what do I owe the honor?

Shit, Paul. I'd love to see you. But I'm kind of laid up here. I've been sick.

Let's get a couple drinks, okay?  Hey, take a look behind us. Do you think that car is followin' us?

I don't know.

Me, too. I had no idea. It's like I was coming apart at the seams.

What is it Paul? What's happening to me?

The army?

I'm so sorry. Obviously you haven't ... Dr. Carlson died.

I have some ice from the machine.

Watch it punk, I'm armed.

That's nine to four, geek-boy.

We can't lead him into the other hull!

Can we blow it with just two?

His mother?

Hurry up, guys. We've got the rescue ship on radar.

Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters. We'll be fine.

Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die!

Thorgan, quit screwing around and come on!

Goodbye, my love.

We'd need charges.

Then what do we do?!

Earth II.

Boeman, the ships not here.

My god! This is way over your head, pal. We need to call some experts and . . .

What the hell are you doing?

ALL I'm saying is dock with Space Lab, couple of hours no more. Let them take a look at our friends.

JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later.

Sergeant!

Kicker, anything?

Where are you going?

Well, I'm not hanging out here with Ms. Showtunes.

Kkinsa, open the goddamn door!

Kkinsa, Crutch is hurt! We need access to the shuttle's med-kit or he'll die.

Hey.

That's why I'm here.

Jason seemed to have the right stuff. Physically, anyway. Radiation, cell damage, didn't matter. He just kept going.

Did you like it?

Rizzo, pull away!

Now what?

It's time.

Well?

Kaboom.

Oh, shit. He's going to see us.

He's trying to ask you out on a date.

Now this is getting exciting.

I'm missing two!

Hurry! She's lost it!

YeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big guy distracted with a blow job.

I'll tell you where he is. He's walking around this ship, killing anything that moves.

No.

I don't know...sorry?

Robot huh?

The air's laced with type two ozone, it reads as a solid.

I'll never experience my fantasy of three sex droids, two humans, and a Knofflapod. Damn.

Sorry, sorry.

Yo, Teach, what the fuck?

Fat Lou, bring the ship to the following coordinates. Call Grendel, have them power up the labs, we're bringing in the find of the century!

Leave him behind!

I don't understand...what does he want?

Something's wrong.

Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels. See what kind of payday we're looking at.

Azrael can you repeat that?

He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead!

Guys, he's right behind us!

You're not going to the ocean with that, are you son?

My cars. And a comic book.

Why are we way out here, when the shark's back there?

He's chasing us! I don't believe it.

Did you burn another kettle? Y'know you're a fire hazard? This is the third one!

Sexy, hm? What was I before?

Love ya.

It's three feet deep, Martin

It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again.

How come you have to tell them that?

You too, sweetheart...

Home... New York?

I'll get to that in a minute. First, I plan to start our seasonal summer help early, and to use shark spotters on beaches open to the sea. I'd like cooperation from local fishermen, and I've also contacted the Oceanographic Institute over on the mainland.

Only 24 hours!

Larry, if you'd see these clowns leave, you'd never believe they'd come back with anything. But they got him!

Something else. Do most attacks go unreported?

There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh...

...Nothing.

He didn't have a dinghy aboard. I'm going down to take a look at his hull.

I hope we get some more help.

Quint...?

And nobody else saw her in the water?

What d'you pay for a place just for the summer?

...So then Denherder and Charlie sat there trying to catch their breath, and figuring out how to explain to Charlie's wife what happened to her freezer full of meat.

Would you like something? Some coffee?

You love sharks?

Going out on the 'Aurora.'

...push this? Oh. It's working. Hello, Martin?

What have you got there, Lenny?

I don't need to pass basic seamanship.

That's pilot whale, isn't it?

Hey, you! Farmer! Half-speed there...

Gettin' ready to run again -- no? No?  What's he playin' here?  Put the gloves on!  Let's see who's gonna tease who now!

He's heading under -- !

That's disgusting! This is the largest, meanest, most vicious shark ever landed off Amity Island, and a known maneater!

Juno MacGuff called while you were out running. She wants to know if you're coming to her little coffeehouse performance on Saturday.

Your shorts are looking especially gold today.

When I see them all running like that, with their things bouncing around in their shorts, I always picture them naked, even if I don't want to. I have intrusive thoughts all the time.

Yeah, typically. That's what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant.

Well! Nothing like experimenting.

Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?

So, it looks like you're getting pregnant-er these days.

We're getting a stretch limo.

You're mad. Why are you mad?

You shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. I'll take it.

Why?

I was just bored. I only think school is awesome like, 80% of the time.

What? I'm not made of stone.

I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?

Just tell it to me straight, Bren. Do you think this is my fault? Her mother's fault?

Juno? Did you happen to barf in my urn? Mac, you know that nice urn by the front door, the one I got up in Stillwater? I found some weird blue shit, I mean stuff, gunk, in there this morning.

Oh, God...

No.

Cool it.

That was a mistake, Juno. Mark is a married stranger. You overstepped a boundary.

We don't even have a dog!

Wow, dream big!

You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?

So, Juno. First off, how far along are you?

Amanda, I told you to go to the infirmary and lie down. You never listen.

Good. Call me when you're OFF the rag.

No.

Whoah. I don't want to see pictures. I don't need to be notified of anything. Can't we just kick it old school? I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way. You know, like Moses in the reeds.

Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?

It's beautiful. I've always liked Gibson better than Fender.

I rock a Harmony.

What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.

Nuh-uh, 1977! Punk Volume 1. You weren't there, so you can't understand the magic.

No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?

Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby...

Madison? Isn't that kind of... I don't know, gay?

Vanessa. Shit, you better get out of here.

Oh really? What's the verdict?

Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? It's beautiful!

"Most Fruitful Yuki"? What is... Oh my god, she's a pregnant superhero!

Only squares and nerds go to dances.

No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!

Uh, hi Su-Chin.

Wise move. I know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once. She took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall and she was like, "Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!"

The tough part's almost over for you. I mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest.

Um, I think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it's not, you know, set in stone.

Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?

Hi. I'm here for the big show?

Would you like some free condoms? They're boysenberry.

What?

Tot ice skating? Tots can't ice skate. Liberty Bell's still getting the hang of stairs.

Only the one in my pants.

Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.

Heavy lifting can only help you at this point.

Well, maybe you could look at one of those adoption ads. I see them all the time in the Penny Saver.

You're not listening to me.

Touche.

How do you know I'm so poisonous? Like, what if the adoptive parents turn out to be evil molesters?

Yum. This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut!

Hly shht!

That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.

Did you hear Bleek is going to prom with Katrina De Voort?

I wouldn't be so sure about that. He did it with you. He's a man now.

Yes. Heating and air conditioning.

What do you make with that?

You're doing an amazing and selfless thing for us.

What did you do?

What?

I've been just wondering if we're, you know, ready.

Why don't we let Juno go home and we can discuss this later on, okay?

She answered our prayers.

I called Gerta Rauss. She says she can represent both of us. They call it "collaborative divorce." It's apparently all the rage right now. And it's easy because we don't have children.

We're actually, finally doing this?

You dropped this.

...Hey you're good. Thought you said you never played before?

Your pictures. Can I see 'em?

You took this picture?

My momma's a beautician. Guess that's where I get it from. She wouldn't hear of my moving in with Early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. Ain't seen her in nearly a year now. I wish she'd call me, just once.

What's up Adele? Dinner ready?

Yeah, and in California you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn...  ...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... And I heard your first month's rent is free; state law. I figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month...

You know... I read once... Ain't nothin' on that big old moon 'cept some old golf balls those astronauts left behind.

Shush, Adele.

What's wrong with her?

Nobody wants to hurt you Peaches!

...Mind if I hold that Bible?

You think I'm goin' to kill you. Well that'd make me a liar then wouldn't it?

You gonna talk to the people who did those murders?

Can't hurt.

Yeah?

Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me?

...and?

Executing the killer wouldn't bring my mother back.

Tonight turned out to be pretty interesting.

No we can't. We can never leave once you start talking about tenure... and vacation pay... and parking privileges and... oh shit! let's just go to California now, right now, before it's too late.

Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together.

Stop being so fucking melodramatic! If it was murder he'd still be locked up or on parole, in which case he wouldn't be allowed to leave the state.

What about you?

...Need a hand with those bags?

Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?

Early, just think...

He's a killer, Brian... He's fucking insane.

Darlin' you were 'bout that far from spendin' the night at the morgue. You understand?

Who d'ya think you're foolin'?  I know you better than you think...

Could be.

Hell if I know, crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to Texas.

How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?

Well, girl. You tested negative for all sexually transmitted diseases and infections.

You're clean.

Oh shit. How long did it take?

Well it took me longer than I thought it would take. It took like 15 minutes to talk her into it. But once it was on, we fucked for a good half an hour. I had to keep taking it out and putting it back in. It hurts the first time.

But then when she got into it. She really got into it. It was good.

Oh man, it smells like butterscotch.

You know what else?

I can tell that she had just entered puberty.

Well, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right.

I don't know about that. She was pretty into it. But I wasn't gonna try. The whole thing is, you just gotta take it slow. Show 'em some respect.

It is right.

Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is.  It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first.

You got any money?

And it got me thinkin'. How fun it would be to share each other's girl.

Man, this guy is really good.

I watched her eat the watermelon. And all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt.

At that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin.

I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.

That's just it. It's elitist. It's reverse elitism. Because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up. I notice what you do.

Whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. You give them money. But if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by.

About ten. Fifteen is good.

You think Darcy is gonna be at Nasa tonight?

Hurry up man. Let's be out. I wanna go swimmin'.

Casper, where is he?

Casper! Was up kid?

Yo, you think we killed that guy?

I don't know. I just never seen girls that did that shit before. But I think it looks nice.

Yeah. Come on.

Yeah. After I saw you last week.

I was lookin' for you all day today.

No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends.

I don't even want to talk, but I gotta tell you that when I first saw you last week, I, I couldn't stop thinking about you. You've been stuck in my head.

No. No, I'm serious. I'm not joking. I just like you. That's all.

Nothing. I'm telling you I just want to make you happy. That's all. Just trust me.

I don't want you to hurt you. I'll be gentle.

Jennie, Jennie. How do you feel?

Because your a virgin?

How old are you?

I'm sorry.

Miss, would I be prying?

Are you in trouble with the law?

Your a real philosopher.

Is Telly there? This is Paul. Who is this?

You are being ripped open.

And sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging.

Wish me luck.

Shh. Come on, it's gonna be OK.

Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out.

I'm coming.

What happened?

Who, Benny's little sister?

Uh, let's see here, would you happen to have diss digg?

Diss digg, diss digg, diss digg.

Yep.

And I know that one of them fucked like two other girls, who were both virgins, so I knew he was safe.

Yeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade.

Mom.

Not too late.

Hello?

What are you guys doing?

Yeah. And it takes them either too long or too short to come. Have you ever had someone that took forever

I can't man.

I've talked to a few people who say you and her were... friendly?

What's that supposed to mean?

Meaning, it looks like his victims are chosen at random.

What do you mean, no?

All you gotta do is look at the map.

Morpheus.

You don't tell us how to run our investigation.  You got that?

No.

What are you talking about?

Debi Rutlege.  Female.  Caucasian. Twenty four.  Worked over at the Four Oaks Hotel.

The F.B.I. has nothing remotely similar to this guy.  I think he's a first- timer.

I was with him the whole time until I got the call at the hotel.

What is it?

Ready for round two?

You should be an actor, Frank.  You looked like you were really mad.  The veins popping out on your neck was a really nice touch.

Sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing -- but who called him today?

What do you mean, stand out?

Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.

Remember eventually revenge is carefully...  Have you tired juxtaposing the words?

We'll find the evidence.

Why did you write remember on the wall?

Hello?

You know her?

Just like who?

Huxley's quote also says, "his play is always fair and just."

You're playing the Tarakoss opening.

What word did you leave last night?

Please... wait.

How'd you know I wouldn't be in the same room with her?

Nope.  Nothing.

What is it?

What scars?

The police came to me for help.  What could I do?

You don't want to believe it.  It's a normal reaction.

Come here.

I know he really likes you.

Congratulations, dad.

I see.  You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?

Has he gotten through to any?

It isn't Kathy.

Whaddaya got, Nolan?

Anything?

You didn't pick up any vibes from the guy?

Kathy?

I don't think it matters.  Last nights victim, Christie Eastman was found in a warehouse on the outskirts of town. The night before, Debi Rutlege was found in the center.

Maybe we should back up a minute and take a look at what we do have.  All the girls that have been killed have been killed at night.  They're all the same type.  All moved into their homes within the last three months -- and all of them found their homes through Homesearchers.

It can't be a coincidence.  The woman that owns it has a son.  She says he's been on vacation in Montana for the last ten days.  We're trying to locate him.  There's also a cleaning service that comes in once a week.  We're checking that out too.

Did you see his face?

Why didn't you tell us you were there earlier?

Mister Sanderson, this is Doctor Sheppard.  She's a psychologist helping us out.

What have you come up with on the riddle?

I still don't see how he could be playing chess against you.  There's only enough grids on the map to be half a board.

Did you send the car?

You opened with the English.  Lutz won't use it.  He opened his first game with it.

It's a good play, but risky.

We got a problem?

You're always in the middle of a match.

Of course.  Yes, here it is.  Why, they're all the same?

Are you one of the players?

It seems like such a complicated game.

Sounds very violent.

Well, I think I've had enough.

They couldn't break the riddle.

You sure you don't want to eat something?

It wasn't intentional.

Oh, but it is.  He's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him.  That's a game.  It has rules and objectives.

I'm just curious.

You have to win every point, don't you?

Relax.

I know you didn't

Alright.  What about me?

It's alright.  It was a long time ago.

Nobody could attack you.  You set your life up like one of your chessboards. You're impregnable -- but at the same time you've become trapped behind your own defenses.  You're cut off from everyone around you.

I just don't want to fight with you.

I tried again and got through.

Peter...

Exactly.  It's the key.

A fierce magazine... brutal...  An angry magazine... A war magazine... a mercenary magazine...  fierce...  Mad.

I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...

If we could just figure out what the next word is going to be.  He said the game's going to end tonight so there's only going to be one more word.

This isn't going to be like the phone book, is it?

You beat him.

No, I want you to do good.  That way when I beat you at the end I'll look that much better.

I'm not nervous.

I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.

You don't understand. I'm just so <u>relieved</u>. I was <u>sure</u> you'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy.

Mine was worse: I dreamt you picked your nose in public.

Will your power outward.

Yes.

Lyssa ...

There is no other way.

There is nothing.

It is the Fortress of Krull. I know it only from the stories of wars on other worlds. They did not use it on our world in the first great war, for it costs them enormous power. This time they mean to conquer, at all costs.

Lyssa? <u>Why</u>?

Never.

The spiral begins in the west.

What use is my sword? I can't reach her!

I can. Because I choose it.

I just remembered I have urgent business in this direction.

Once is enough, thank you.

I don't think you'll grow careless.

Fame is what you leave to your sons.

Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for.

They stand at the edge of the grave and make jokes.  Do you know who I am, sprout? I am Torquil, Lord of the forest. My men follow no man but me, and I follow no man at all.

They burn many villages. Even walled cities fall to them.

Yes. It will double our range.  I know at least a dozen ways to get horses. All cheap.

Lad, you have an unnatural desire to pay for things. It stunts the mind and shrivels the imagination.

We could reach it on fire-mares.

We must cover a hundred leagues before sunrise.

Nothing worse than lower-class boors with upper-class morals.

Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.

You do?

One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?

Sir Ergo? ... My honorable Lord Ergo? ...

Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so <u>ugly</u>.

But also very young. Six to one is no odds, boy.

And do you think I live on air?

Look at its beauty. Look at its grace.

He didn't join them. They joined him.

They'll trample him to death!

What news from our friends?

You were attacked in the forest?

Can you see?

Knowledge I wouldn't want.

We'll seek an Emerald Seer. They have great powers of vision.

The leader of the Dark Ones?

I must go to the widow. Perhaps she will help.

Do not try your trickery on me!

It will not help.

She told them you wanted her things and that she wasn't surprised police looked for you! Can you believe it?!

YEAH! I was sure! Come on, tell me! I know him?

I can't believe it! "Yes I think"... How she kids me! I can't believe it!  And did he pass your threshold or not?

...You moved too, didn't you?

At a certain moment I thought: maybe Leon would like working on his own? So he makes some little extras?

No, no.

Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.

130... 140...

Look. When you can see his fingers, it's 50 meters.  When you just see his hands, it's about 80 meters. When you distinguish arms from body, it's 120-130. When you see nothing more than a shape, you don't shoot.  Not very sure. You have one chance out of five to miss.  A contract means getting all chances on your side. 5 out of 5.  You can't miss a client. Never... If the task is delicate or the risk is too big, you double. That is, you insure yourself by another means.

Well, if the guy is far, in a car, and I know weather is going to be bad, rain for example, I think I would plastic the car, with a remote here. I shoot from the distance and if I miss I plastic.

It's strange, being in love... It's the first time for me...

Mathilda? May I come in?

Not taken.

If you knew, Leon...!  I killed one thousand in my head...  And this never disturbed my sleep.

When I say I love you.

...OK.  I love you anyway.

Where are you going?

Risky business, isn't it?

...Don't you drink?

...No...

...That's awful.  I hope you killed, that asshole?

May I ask you a personal question?

Why did you unleash the pipe, I don't know?

How shall we get out now, Leon?

No! I don't want to leave you!!

You say it just to calm me!

Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything.

How are you, Miss?

Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise.

...Composer.

Yeah, but he's not exactly my father...

You can't sit here like that.

But... He works for your same employer?

Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?

Did you fish in Messina? The "pesce spada"?

You'd better talk good, son, because, for the moment, I've got a quite bad opinion about you.  Norman smiles.

Uncle Maurice -- I spent all our frequent flyer miles on a one way ticket here... I have a rented car outside, just listen to me.  Come back with me now, and if you still want to do something like this in a year -- maybe we'll plan a car trip across the country -- Gerald and I will come along --

What if you don't make it?

What would you like us to do?

We're very sorry about that.  Some of our men were on the scene of the accident.

Look, I'll see if anyone has spotted him recently.  If I get any information, I'll call you.

This is Indiana -- nothing's going to happen to you.

The normal amount of build up in your arteries has been aggravated by over exertion.  This is called, "Claudication,"  As a result, there isn't enough circulation to your body.  That accounts for the discoloration in your extremities and the muscle spasms I'm sure you've encountered.

So what's the deal Maurice?

You thought I sent them?

Have I forgotten something?  Is this a special day?

Ellen?

There's no reason.

It's one of those thoughts you keep to yourself.

I know where my heaven is.

Why there?

Thank you... I'm sorry you had to lie.  It must have been difficult.

What's his story?

Red flag, man.

It's going to look beautiful when he turns out to be that animal who paid a visit to the Steadman's house.

Well, hello.

There was a boy named Isaac who wanted to play baseball, but he was too small and no one would let him play... but he kept practicing by himself -- waiting... He went to every game and sat in the stands with his glove.

Okay nine.  Big Billy's team was losing and he was on base.  That's when Isaac came up.  He could barely hold the bat... Big Billy winked at Isaac... The ball was pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard. It soared up and out over the stadium.  Everyone cheered.  Isaac hit a home run and won the game. After the game, Isaac asked Big Billy why he let he play.  Big Billy smiled and said, I wasn't always Big Billy, I was Little Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy went off after the game and read a classic book together.  The end.

Three thousand miles?... How many times does twenty go into three thousand?

Don't worry baby, it shouldn't take you more than five days if you just stop to sleep and eat.

Umm, he's going to make it isn't he?

Are you firing me?

I'm really lost.  What does this have to do with walking?

Ellen got up every morning and went to the corner store to get me my bread for breakfast... Everyday. Now that's about a quarter mile each way... 17 years... that comes to about three thousand miles...  And you know what Kris?

Are they standing?

She knows you love her Mr. Parker. She knows now.

There are a lot of people worried about you.

In a hospital.

What do your friends call you?

You're in pain.

... My father.

I don't have kids.

How are you feeling?

He wants to reward you... That's why I'm here.

I've always wanted a watch like that.

What do you want?

You're pretty drunk.

I guess I do too.

What's the story? Are you too drunk to come?

What's up?

First. It's our first. I'm just concerned. So... why are you killing yourself?

Want a drink? Great nap. Wanna go out tonight?

Why?

...and I'm not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life. We know I'm a drunk... but that seems to be all right with you. And I know that you're a hooker. I hope you understand that I'm a person who is totally at ease with this... which is not to say that I'm indifferent or that I don't care... I do... it simply means that I trust and accept your judgement. What I'm saying is... that I hope you understand that I understand.

I'm going to fill it right now.

What do you mean?

I tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me -- not like you wanted to hit me, but more just waving me away. Security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling. They wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street, but I talked them into letting me walk you out.

Please!

I've missed the best sun. Why did you have to pawn your watch?

I wanted to see you...

You know I love you... yeah?

The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new  one.

You have been lonely?

I'm pleased with you, Sera... how you have moved up in the world. I showed you a glamorous world when I took you off the streets...  and how you repay me.

It is, after all, Sera, my money.

A full night on the street and this is all?

Harvard Law School?

Brooke, I believe you. But a jury is gonna want an alibi.

I'm a Delta Gamma and I'm a huge fan of yours!

Are you okay? You look so sad... and so orange.

It's so shameful...

I have made my fortune on my ability to teach women how to perfect their bodies with the Brooke's Butt Buster workout.

So at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?

Yes, Your Honor. Had you ever gotten a perm before, Miss Windham?

And if you in fact, heard the gunshot, then Brooke Windham wouldn't have had time to hide the gun before you got downstairs. Which would mean that you would've had to have found Mrs. Windham with a gun in her hand to make your story sound plausible. Isn't that right?

Huh?

I'm sorry, but --

You're not going up there.

So she was distraught that her husband was dead?

Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Rule 3:03.

-- his life?

What could I do?  He's a man who followed his pecker to greener pastures. I'm a middle- aged high-school dropout with stretch marks and a fat ass. Happens every day. At least to women like me.

You can't go home!

Uh -- family.

I'm her sister.

Hi. Sarah Knottingham.

Our group is full.

I believe her, too. I don't think she's having an affair with Enrique.

Warner can't even do his own laundry.

Why else would she have flown in from Newport? It's not like she'd Fed Ex a six carat diamond.

I don't know! Everything was normal at first and then he said he needed someone more --  Serious!

Here. You're gonna need this.

Elle, do you know what happened on "Days of Our Lives" yesterday?

Picking out my wedding dress!

Speaking of which, can you please put on some party clothes? You look like someone rolled you in something sticky and dragged you through a K- Mart.

No, but she made me cry once. Not in class -- I waited until I got to my room, but yeah, she can pretty much shrivel your balls -- or you know, your whatevers.

Don't ask.

She's not!

Hey --

Up for a celebration dinner?

Oh, he is so over on this campus.

Girls -- I'm going to Harvard!

I miss you guys! The people here are so vile! Hardly anyone even talks to me unless it's to say something that's not nice. Law school sucks!

Neither.

I did?

I don't know --

It's pink.

You don't really believe she's innocent?

I completely agree.

You go where?

I'm sorry, I just hallucinated.

Well, yeah, but --

If you tell him, you'll probably make summer associate. Who cares about Brooke? Think about yourself.

It made me realize something. I'm an idiot.

Where?

And what is your boyfriend's name?

You go?  Not watch fun?

Your love.

I speak of love, and you think only of the lash.

Sweet Princess, you begin to sound most reasonable.

Your soul...?  Why should I bother with such a paltry trifle?

You're a beast!

It sounded like it came from the courtyard.

Yes.  I feel that, too.  Weakness is what is ugly.

To be strong and free... that is all I desire.

Country fa' fa' away.  To the East, beyond the lising sun...

Flozen foleva not good.

An' how you do it?  How you rift cuss?

Friend Ogg.  Excuse our enthusiasm, occasioned as it was by a fondness for you.

So, Jack... think you be a Green Man and not know Gump.

Oh, but you will be, Jack... Think you to sleep in a faerie ring and not spend the night a-dancing?

You have me word, lad.  To answer a faerie riddle deserves as much.

Are ye afraid of me wine?  Did your momma tell ye never to take food nor drink from the Wee Folk?  Think if ye sup with the faeries you'll be enchanted?

Why has this happened to the world? Why is it winter now, and dark?

Don't you know?

Someone worthy of respect, lad.  She be a water spirit, lives in a bog down at sea-side.  Hideous creature to look at, even by my doubtful standards; devours little children, she does, when she can catch them.

Twill take more than heart.  Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?

There be no finer victuals than worm flesh, lad.

By the grace of God.

Worse than the battlefield.

Better to kill than be disturbed.

Tis not the sword that counts, but the man what swings it.  Rest easy, Jack.

... this rate... we'll all be in our graves... 'fore we reach the Baron's fortress...

Hold, Jack!  Don't strike!

There's more than one way to spring a trap.

A fine mess this is... horrid, nipping creatures... What do we now, Jack?

What magic have we on our side?

Then it's Godspeed, Screwball.

Nay.  You've not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine.

I'm not afraid of the dark.

Not in the mood, I'm afraid.

Ogg lives there...!  And Thurgis!

We seek to undo the curse.

Someone like Floki... or Squarefoot... or --

Greetings, my lady, the green wood is honored.

These for me?

You promised!

What shall we do?

I am a princess.  You have no right to order me about.

Oh Jack, mightn't I touch one?  It would thrill me so.

Where are you going?

Who?

Tis the truth.

I'm afraid it may storm.

I have no wife.

Sunlight?

Oh!  Green Jack!  What a dream I've had... proper nightmare.

Seemed like weeks and weeks.  Such a terrible dream... I could never tell you...

Oh no, dearest Jack... I meant every word.

Biting you?

Pinching?  Where?

We seek the ogre, Baron Couer de Noir.  He slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter.

Sigurd's sword...

Well spoke, boy.  You have discerning taste for one so young... Just who might you be?

I like well your conceit, Jack.  Tis rare to find an honest lad in this troubled world.

How do I get the horn back?

Where do I find the Baron's castle?

Not very precise directions.

Never even had a sword in my hand until yesterday.

Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.

Oona... don't cry... please, you mustn't...

Please...

The fastest in the world.

What care the bones when the soul is free?

Maybe there's a better idea... What about birds... get a lift from some friendly bird...

Each fit for a hero... My uncle fashioned a hammer for Thor.  Twas he named it Mjolnir.  Grandfather forged Excalibur... You won't ever see finer craftsmanship.

You're with us in battle.

Can you show us the way?

Marco!

Are you going to see Sam again?

Oh, honey.  There's not much to do there. I mean, it's all work.

Did you know him before you knew Dad?

He's not there.

I'd be more comfortable if he slept in the guestroom.

Sorry I got you into trouble.

Are you his friend?

Alyssa.

Can you keep Sam straight?

I'm hungry!  Where's my dinner?  Who ate my dinner?  Huh?  Who's in trouble now?

I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.

Where's your dad?

He's a freak.

I can't even take a shower here.

Josh and I are going to South Coast. Wanna ride?  Maybe see a movie?

Are you sure you're totally into guys?

No, I don't...NO.  I thought we were just friends.

Okay, but then we'll just be friends. Okay?

Mr. Dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches.

Mr. Stevens.  One of your neighbors is adamant your home has exceeded its approved height.  He's filed to have construction stopped immediately.

Oh...nothing.  Thirty pounds.  I just haven't been very hungry.

Peter Webber!  Right.  Quite the spotlight on that guy.

Maybe...?

Class of eighty-six!  I didn't know you were there.

You're here early today.

George, this is the third time.

Hello?

The whole summer, man.  Party in Tahoe.

I'll be around to check up on you.

Who are you, anyway?  I don't even know you.

I'm not going!

Probably in the bible.

I want you to take out your nose ring and leave it out.

No one would blame me if I left!

Why don't you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom?

Where are you going?

You're too fucking late.

Hi, Alyssa.

I took some of your Vicodin.

I couldn't imagine how I could compete with him for any part of you.  So, I didn't.  He wanted you to have his last name...I let him even take that.

I'm proud of you, Sam.

Are you talking?

After everything.

We're all dying from the start.  I just got picked for Advanced Placement.

I'd eat a lot of red meat.

What would you do?

I aimed high.

Your kid was down around Diver's Cover again, smoking pot.  I didn't write him up...told him I wouldn't tell you...

Mr. Dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house.

How many bedrooms will your house have?

I just wanted to know where Mom was?

It's okay.

I didn't think you'd know I went missing.

I need to talk to you.

I was parked in day parking.

I'm going to tear down the shack and build my house.

I love those doors.

The garage.

Thank you for at least sounding sincere.

Forget it, really.  I'll survive.

What was I supposed to do?  When you didn't show up Saturday, I tried to call. Your phone isn't working.

I did say he could go.

It makes me sad.

You head was pressed against my chest.  I could feel your heart racing.  And I remember I kissed your hair.

Oh...with his ear infection!

Maybe you shouldn't come everyday.

You've never said that before.

Is your back still killing you?

We've eaten.

Do you think it's odd your kids don't hug you?

After the kids are back in school.

I've been helping for the last few days. Weeks.  Sam's working.  I told you Sam was working.  I mean, he really is.

Despite you.

I hardly recognize you with a beard.

Hey.

I've missed you guys.

I guess I could teach you some things.

What are you doing in my room?

I read the letter.  You read the will. He wants you to keep it.  To live in it some day.

Ryan, would you rather swim or work?

I brought a few of my own.

No, nigger.

She'll be fine. She just had a bit of a shock.

These are free papers.

Yo, Blocker, what's going on here?

Yeah, but what about me and Ray? I didn't see our names on that pardon. You said you were gonna put in a good word for us.

Yeah.

Claude, mind helping me to the bathroom?

Season tickets to the Yankees. Right there on the first base line.  What's wrong, baby?

Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up.

Ten dollars. But I need it to get home.

Sure I do. What's your name again?

I didn't start out to be a bank teller. I was gonna be a ballplayer. Even had an offer to play short for the Newark Eagles.

Ah, go chase yourself. I'll take my business elsewhere. And for future reference, you are no longer welcome at Ray's Boom-Boom Room.

You mean this sign? The one that says "No Coloreds Allowed." That's a good question. Ray, how come we missed the sign?

Thanks for backing me up here, Uncle Claude.

You're soft.

Alright. You want some pie?

You lost all our money in a card game?

I think he's hurt pretty bad.

What ain't there?

I wouldn't do that if I was you.

Why do you think they call him Jangle Leg?

So?

You want out of this place, don't you? Don't tell me you're starting to like it here.

What do I want? What makes you think I want something?

Well, if you're still thinking about booking it, I want in. I think we can make it.

Come on, man. Don't shut me out. I'm telling you, you and me, that map, we can go places.

I know these trees all look the same, but I'm getting an awful familiar vibration from this one right here. You sure you know where we're going?

That's right, we'll get off at the next stop. The train's pulling into the station right now.

I know people.

You can starve to death for all I care. Now shut up, the game's about to start.

He said they keep it parked out behind the barn. Can't be that hard to fly a plane. Lots of people do it.

I don't see you coming up with any plans.

I was sorry to hear about your mama passing.

What the hell are you doing?

Come on, man, I'm starting to cramp up here.  We have the chance right here, right now, I say we go!

You sure it was him?

I can't eat this.

Hell of a day for a ballgame, huh, Claude?

No, this ain't gonna work either. It's half chocolate, half vanilla.

If you don't eat that ice cream right now, I'm gonna strangle you until you are completely dead.

How you doin'?

Then you won't have no problem making the adjustment. You need anything, help of any kind, gimme a holler. Name's Jangle Leg.

At least he didn't kill Santa Claus with his bare hands.

Ray, my man, this steak is like butter!

Tell him the state of Mississippi is only interested in getting this ditch cleared by sundown.

Looks like we got a couple of live ones. How long these boys in for?

Hell of a way to get out. Heard they burned up in that fire yesterday.

What do you think about that?

Old man Wilkins' never came out of that bathroom. Died right there on the crapper.

Wait for the firemen!

You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!

Mr. Johnson is very well connected. If you were to let us go, I guarantee he would show you his appreciation, if you know what I mean.

Appreciate it.

Hey, Ray, Goldmouth don't believe me. Ain't it so they got trains up in New York City that run under the streets?

That's it. The Boom-Boom Room. Sure would like to see that place when you get it up and running.

What's your name?

What are you in for, Willie?

Goldmouth? They say he was born out back behind the shithouse. That's what they say.

Last night? What are you talking about, Ray?

ADRIAN!

You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.

Ta-da. So what time is my brother expected back?

And give you a good buzz.

Oh. My. God. I can't believe you're here. Welcome. Can I just tell you, I am so excited right now.

I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris.

I'll call her later.

All these good people have totally been led astray.

The home of eternal damnation, house of Hades, H.E. double toothpicks...

Try an angel.

Valerie's crying!

What is it?

Did you just talk?

My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.

From now on. I'm just going to avoid all moving metal objects.

I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.

In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino.

Now that was an experience. "You are only coming through in waves." That line blows my mind every time.

I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?

You're a good devil, Dad.

No. This can't be happening.

You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.

Hey.

So go get 'em, Jimmy!

Easy, Liberace.

Did you check out the dragon mouth?

That's a big pass, Elton John.

Schnapps...

Which way did he go?

What's Ozzy trying to say there?

No thanks. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.

So I followed him...

I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here!

It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific." Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in?

You got the wrong window again, man.

I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.

Here, have a Popeye's. This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.

It's freezing my hands.

This town is really going to hell lately.  So what part of the city do you live in?

You have a dog? What kind?

Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.

Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?

Hey.

Nicky!

Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that?

Do me.

It looks like the work of a brother...

Okay, now you gone and done it. You done messed with my business bitch!

How do you think we got here??!!

Where do you think we came from?

How do you want us?

How did they get in here?

I think you've been skulling out too much. First Nursery and now stupid questions.

Why did you do that??!!

It's him! The first Sandman. He killed... Doc.

He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.

That's right. The other one came after. The older one. Smashing, killing, burning!

Please... no?  You mean "not here" -- that's it? You're a private Available but particular.  Don't worry. There's no one here but me. And you.

Later.

And?

About what?

But if you're one of the misfits... that's where I come in.

Are you a 5 or a 6? 

You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?

Why tell me?

I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.

Where did you get that?

I don't..

Are you here to help me?

A Runner... Cathedral. A woman.

When did you begin to question Lastday?

Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.

Yes, but they won't know that... or care. They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, now...

That sweet madman -- how could he come to exist?

I'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and --

Things change!

And Sanctuary?

Are you sure?

I'll make the arrangements.

Of course... that's settled then. But just you remember your promise...

I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.

Are you ready to put him in?

To a city with thousands and thousands of people.

That's better than gold when it's cold.

I'm sorry.

Can you make it back?

I don't know who you are. I'd like to thank someone.

Someone will follow. When you come to the lock, he will tell you how to go on the other side. Jessica may go with you as far as the lock.

You're not contagious are you?

Just goin' up'ta "Tops"... Maybe the "Ten Pin".

You want somethin'?

I'm, okay... You okay?

No.

How'd the camera get so high like that?

We'll keep a watch on the house.

You don't remember being awakened? It looks like you were aware of someone.

Has anyone made any threats to either of you recently?

We've got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place.

Hi.

You like it?

What deal?

What's he do?

How'd you get in with these fuckin' people?

In pornos?

That's his name... Andy. Our ticket out of here.

Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.

You killed him.

Andy, who is that guy?

Mr. Smith has been waiting for you and Mrs. Trueworthy. Can you take care of Mr. Smith now?

Okay. Thanks.

Yeah.

Hey.

The police called us.

They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night. They wanted to know if you remembered anything.

You talk to him?

You just gonna let him go?

Who is it?

What is this, Rogoff?

No.

I'll get a manual.  and study it.

That's it.

Did you use the alarm system since we were here last?

Headache, huh? Too much sun, I guess. You want to come in?  Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it.

Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.

It's nice to know I can still make you laugh.

Who's it from?

You're up early.

So?

What was that?!!!

I told you to stay in the car!

Thanks, Mr. Eddy.

Okay.

What's goin' on?

What are you guys doin'?

You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known.

You still care about me?

Whatiya mean, Sheila?

Sheila?!

What do you want?

I didn't know you cared.

All of it?

Conway's gone again! Run out! Listen to this! From Gainsford.

Well, there's certainly nothing wrong with that meal!

I beg your pardon, brother. What did you say you were hunting?

Uh-huh.

Yeah, I remember. You said that before.

Don't call me brother.

Good morning, Lovey.

Yes. And who is he ? How'd he get there?

Mr. Barnard, I do not like this place. I definitely do not like this place.

Yeah? If this be execution, lead me to it.

Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.

Don't mind Lovey. He's got the misery.

Thinking? What about some double solitaire?

The police?

Barney? Why should I? Never! We have nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What effrontery!

Yeah. You know.

Hey Lovey, come here! Lovey, I asked for a glass of wine and look what I got. Come on, sit down.

There you are!

Why? Why 'come on' all the time? What's the matter?  Are you going to be a fuss budget all your life? Here, drink it up! Aren't you having any fun? Where was I?

Well, that's that, I guess.

Chalmers Bryant!

Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it.  Say, I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang.  So long. Don't you take any wooden nickels.

I say, will you have a cigarette?

Say, you're an American, aren't you?

Right this very minute!  The porters are waiting for us on the plateau. And that Chinaman thought he could stop me. Come along.

You will need suitable clothes for the journey. It is not particularly far, but quite difficult.

Goodness, no!

By the way, what religion do you follow here?

Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.

Who?

108 and still active?

I surprise you? Now that's news.

Yes. I'm afraid it does.

Charming, isn't she?

Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.

You must prevail upon him not to attempt the journey. He could never get through that country alive.

You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain. Why don't you try looking up at the top sometimes?

What exactly do you mean by "almost any time now"?

We were just going to bury him when you came along.

Oh, yes. There is a tribe of porters some five hundred miles from here. That is our only contact with the outside world. Every now and again, depending upon favorable weather of course, they make the journey.

Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?

You're lying, aren't you?

Are you taking me?

Sondra Bizet.

Yes. She has read your books and has a profound admiration for you, as have we all.

You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.

The next time you're in wild country like this, keep in touch with the British Consul.

What's it mean?

Something happened to me, when we arrived here, George, that - well - did you ever go to a totally strange place, and feel certain that you've been there before?

Of course you would. If ever we get out of this place, the thing for you to do is to take that job with Helen's father.

Uh-huh.

Well - I heard that if you want a man's wife, she's yours, if he's got any manners.

Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we?

What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk.

What's she got to do with it?

So everyone is serenely happy in Shangri-La? Nobody would ever think of leaving?  It's all just so much rot! She's pleaded with me ever since I came here to take her away from this awful place. She's cried in my arms for hours, for fear I'd leave her behind. And what's more, she's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters - for me!

was saying

Good.

We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.

You know, each time I see you, I hear that music. What is it?

Oh, you've read my books. You do more things! What have my books got to do with it?

A man whose life was empty!

Yes.

Thank you.

Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked to him last night.

I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?

I'm so glad.

Ouch!

Oh, the usual reasons. A world full of people struggling for existence.

You know, if you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere. And don't ask me why.

It's the most annoying word in the English language. Did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it?  Mother's little darling musn't stick her fingers in the salad bowl. Why? Because it isn't lady- like to do that. Why? Because that's what forks are made for, darling.

Would you like to wring my little neck?

Be quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China. He knows what he's doing.

What do you want him to do?

How about you? Do you want to go?

The hell were you thinking?

Once I thought the biggest thing I'll ever do was guard the president.

It's easy.  You work your way up the secret service, one day stand with the President, meet the most important people on the planet, fulfill your dreams, live happily ever after.

You think we're nuts.

You do?

Dee.  God damn it.  I told you to go home.

Pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! Take the van and go.

I know, but we're on a college campus...

I think you're too used to it.  If you ask me, you've been doing this job too long.

Well, one thing's for sure.  You could certainly lighten up.

Why?  Well, it wouldn't hurt you to have a little more fun.  I know I don't know you all that well, but--

what's this?

Why did Mikey leave Nazca?

Looks like a train ticket.

What's going on, Kay?

You think that's what's-happening?

Jesus Christ...

We saw it in the office.  It went from this big...    to big...   in a day.

in case I need it?

You coulda told me what you were doing.

Kay, you're scaring your partner.

I'm just wondering what's so great out there that everyone's trying to get to it?

So... how'd you hear about this?

I swear to God, that was not here two days ago...

What do we do?

What if you have the foggiest clue as to where the queen is?

The kid looked desperate.  I figured...

Oh yeah?  Well if you're suddenly such a good samaritan, why didn't you file a departure report, like you're supposed to?  You know how many rules you've just broken?

Try seven.  From unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident.  You wanna tell me what's going on?  Huh?

I know what this is.    Zed, you in?

Did our friend announce when he's making his speech?

We're from Scientific American.  We read about your discovery.  We'd like to take a look.

This it?

I mean, I dunno.  I've seen insects with really great camoflauge ability.  But never like this.

We're with the immigration and Naturalization Service, Intergalactic Bureau.  We monitor all-alien activity in and around Earth and its enveloping atmosphere.

Which way?

How's Dee?

Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.

Hard to tell.  I hope not.

I'm getting a trajectory...

Actually, I don't know...

How'd you know?

Why, you might ask?  Because you're ready.  Because you've finally gone as far as you can go without it.

No.  Follow him.

Agatha...

Please, I want to go back...

Can't you see?  She just wanted her little girl back.

She grew up.

About who?

You do understand I can't just give you new irises.  The scanners will read the scar tissue.  Alarms will go off.  Large men with guns will appear...

From where?  D.C.?

Kill type?

Huh, we don't seem to have her data.

Looks like she was a neuroin addict like John Doe here, but I show an address history that includes the Beaton Clinic.

Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?

She's worried about you.  And, quite frankly, so am I.

What if Danny Witwer came to you right now and insisted on a full chem run?

You understand, John, that the minute Precrime goes national, they're going to take it away from us.

Somebody named Leo Crow.

I have no idea.  I've never heard of him.  But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.

Okay, Jad, what's coming?

You guys are nodding your heads like you actually know what the hell he's talking about.

But it's not the future if you stop it.  Isn't that a fundamental paradox?

Why did you catch that?

The Precogs don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.

It was Iris Hineman.  She developed the Precogs, designed the system and pioneered the interface.

At least now you -- and I -- have the chance to make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone ever again.

You set me up...

They're not in any pain.  We keep their heads pretty well stocked with dopamine and endorphins. Plus, we maintain careful control over their serotonin levels -- don't want 'em to drift off to sleep, but they can't be kept too awake either.

Detective.  Nice of you to come down here.  Seeing as every cop in the world is looking for you right now.  Jesus, what's up with your eye?

Well, hey, you didn't have to come all the way down here.  For you, Chief, I make housecalls...

She's got information inside of her.  I need you to get it out.

I was looking for you...

Do you know who I am?

It floated back up.  I had to take him out and --

You're not gonna kill me?

I don't know -- I never saw his face.  All I know is, the next day I was out, so the guy must've had juice somewhere.  Look, man, you gotta go through with this.

Yes, I'm afraid that would be from the Doll's Eye.

You have three minutes to tell me what you're doing here before I feed you to a few of my more predacious plants.

What's so funny?

It began as play.  A guessing game like you play with any toddler, except these children always guessed right.  And then the nightmares started. They were all different, but all the same.  They were all about murder.  And the murders were all happening.

So many of them... despite what we did for them.  Or maybe because of what we did to them.  It doesn't matter.  It's a perfect system now, isn't it?

Then how did he --

It's insanity around here.

Who?

Lamar, do you know the reason why John came here to work with you?

Sir, the press conference is starting.

He came to see you yesterday. Right before he got tagged.  What did you talk about?

Why are you protecting him?  You knew he was doping, yet you did nothing about it.

Lamar, I found something.

Good God.  What was that?

I did find it.  It was inside of Agatha all this time.  So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?

So there is a way to fool the system?

Uh, yeah, being concert master of the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra is one of our most popular choices...

So if you wanna kill someone, you take him to Miami.

Because of the nature of murder.  "There's nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another".

It doesn't matter.  He wins.

He's trying to prove his innocence.

If you were a child killer, you took these pictures, would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find?

He looks familiar.

We could have lunch together.

My name is Danny Witwer.  I'm --

This your work?

I don't have any sugar either.

That was our apartment.

Since right after we lost our son.

He took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies.  This is all in your statement, Lara...

To prevent a murder.  Sooner or later, he's going to contact you.

Wally, the other two can still function, right?

Maxie wants me to replace you on the job tomorrow. He wants you to come by the office today.

Yeah, snifters are for cognac --

It's as good a suite as we have, unless you want two bedrooms.

Is he cute?

You think he don't know? I give him his cut of seventeen hundred, I think he knows I can't make that lap dancing.

Ricky's not wearing one.

Hello.

So, what kind of gig is this?

Don't expect you to mention it to him. I'm just saying, if --

No coke tonight.  Right?

Good! It'll save me the trouble of repeating myself. He's not fucking driving you!

Goodbye, Bobby.

Your dance is over.

What's up? Jess ready?

Yeah.

He making the drop?

So, when's the drop.

Why isn't Ruiz coming?

What's that?

So what do we do?

Where is this happening?

Brooklyn.

Heard of them.

How so?

Smart. Hard as hell to handicap. You know what I like? Hai Alai. Fast game. You know why I like it?

Never won a race. But it got me in with the trainer. We'd have a thing, I don't remember, some fucking thing. The jockey would raise his whip, it meant the fix was in, we'd all go running. People get greedy. First they bet small, they keep their mouth shut. Within a month's time, everyone and their brother was in on it. The odds would drop, I mean you could watch the goddamn board. It looked like a fuckin stopwatch, the odds would drop so fast.

I like you, kid. Why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you?

Not driving Jess, you won't.

Ruiz wants to go alone, but it's not up to Ruiz. It's up to me, and I like a sure thing. Just go and we're square on the tooth.

You want --

I don't need a few days. I'm gonna settle down with Jess. She's through dancing. We're opening a restaurant.

I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.

Where is the Soho Grand?

So, Jimmy, you know where this address is?

No. Just the cross streets.

I can wait around if you want.

'Trustafarians?'

Taken care of?

So's this.  Hey baby... Oh, nothing. What were you saying?

We're with Ruiz.

We're supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on the list?

Any time, bro.

How am I being shitty?

Of course I don't want you to bring it up to him... But if it comes up...

Yeah. Page me. You know the number?

I'll page you with the number. I'll see you later. What time you done?

Ask if he said anything to her.

Fuck them.

I think we might.

I like it.

Max won't let me drive Jess to dance anymore.

Jesus, man. Plus ten?

Who's gonna smell me a mile away?

We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month.

You just don't fucking get it, do you?

What the fuck is that supposed --

Well, I thought you understood and I was just missing it.

Yeah, but you know Horrace. What did you get off him?

Hi.  It's Ruiz.  Yeah. So the driver knows where to go? When? We'll be down in five. No, I'll tell him. He's right there. Bye.

What are you doing.

You gonna shank him in the shower?

I swear to God, I'll fucking puke.

We need guns.

Wanna bet?

Eighty.

You did?

So what do we do?

Three and a half hours?

Holy shit. Get me back to Manhattan.

Fine, fine. And you were...?

I don't wear a white wig, I don't carry a gavel.

Where's the surprise?

Yeah. Ricky Slade.

Cardiff Giant?

Cardiff Giant. Just check.

Did you see that shit? Motherfucker.  You let in fucking Screech, dude? I'm waiting and you let in Screech?

It's in your copy of Hemispheres. I believe it's Mickey Blue Eyes.

Yes.

It means you got a gun?

The Welsh dude, sees all these niggers in perms and diamonds and shit, he gets nervous. But you motherfuckers, he just laughs. All beat up in your babaloo suit like Fruitpie the Magician.

Well, I didn't care for the club much. And, I must say, I didn't care for him either.

What do you want?

No, really, mate?

Yeah.

Good morning.

Ricky.

So whenever we want...

So you're our own private guy?

Nigger, please. Don't even order that artichoke shit. West side guineas. Forget the drinks, Leo. We gotta roll. What do I owe you?

That money is your per diem.

What the fuck you think, I wanna 'hang' with you motherfuckers? Yeah you're working. And put down the champagne.

What the fuck was you told? Don't talk, right?

No...

Well, that's news to me. The name's Tom.

Scotland.

Dip?

Sit down. We ain't fixing to eat you. You look brand new in town. Pretty handy with a bottle.

Why?

How's it feel?

I told you less paper, less trouble.

Sometimes you got a big ugly mouth.

1, 2, 8; 2, 8, 1.  I git 'em all?

Shit, what else she gonna say?

What you say?

Who the hell are you?

I respect myself. A man cuss because he hasn't got the words to say what's on his mind.

Don't con me.

I can't make out that shit.

That's bullshit. That's a white man's book. Ain't all these white man's books?

Then what you telling me to study in them for?

Man, I'm studying in the man's book. I don't dig half the words.

Aardvark, noun. An earth pig; an ant- eating African mammal. Man, that sounds like the dozens.

Yeah. When I was picking a lock to rob somebody's house.

Now about our coming up in the world a little. You're not naive. You're a man of the world. The Movement's grown; we've grown with it. You know folks. They want their leaders to be prosperous. One hand washes the other.

Folks are sitting out there today, not next week, expecting to hear our program.

Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard man on women. You want to know why?

Considering today's standards of animal raising and curing meats, I don't fully understand the restriction on pork.

You're from Detroit, near where I come from. You majored in education at Tuskegee. You're studying nursing and having trouble with your family.

No, good Sisters are rare. We need every one. Tell me something: how tall are you?

There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and vain.

I'm in Detroit.

I'll be away a lot.

I don't want to bring my troubles home. You know that.

"Los Angeles, UPI: Elijah Muhammad, 67-year-old leader of the Black Muslim Movement, today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children..."

What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.

I'm sorry. I haven't been the best husband or father.

I want to also, but until we are instructed by the Messenger to do so, we will just wait and pray.

Brother Earl.

I assumed...

Brother Minister, what is wrong?

What color were the original Hebrews?

You left one phrase out. Another educated Kneegrew said to me and I quote: "Brother Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the Negro subculture." Would you agree?

If I surprise you, let me explain. Menial work teaches us humility.

I thought you said we were going to the movies last night.

You know that gal?

Let's go.

-- there is a serious question as to whether --

Get out.

How many you turning out?

Another one?

I'm with you, Brother Minister.

Let me die then.

You're my father.

That's alright. Baby, take your time. Sophia's not going anywhere. I told you to walk, don't run.

Yeah, girl; that's your story. When you gonna holler "rape," sister?

Don't you know, you can't hump the Bogart.

I'm tired of always playing the cops. I wanna be Bogart sometimes.

What did you do, Homey, palm it?

So? The man got silver, china, rugs --

You want to be the head man?

Brother Minister he often talked about you. He loves you, loves you like his own son. Says you are the best, his greatest Minister but that someday you would leave him and turn against him.

We were parceled out, all five of us. I went to this reform school and lived at this woman's house. She was in charge.

The same thing as you. Except, my reach isn't as long as yours. My father was a policemen, did you know that?

[Where are you coming from?]

[Where are you staying in Mexico?]

[Why?]

Another favor... get me banking info on Jordan Kalfus. U.S. deposits or withdrawals. Thanks. Oh, get me the same on Samuel Ramos.

[Don't lie to me.]

[What money?]

[Drive.]

[I don't know! We work in parts. A voice calls in a kidnapping. We deliver the target to the guardians. We don't even know them. They might transfer to other guardians. The negotiators and the bosses don't even see the target. They just make the deal!]

[He has a tattoo covering two-thirds of his back. He is part of the Brotherhood.]

[This is not possible. But in that house I have money. If I tell you where --]

[Yeah.  Yes.]

[Do you know who I am? I am the commandante of the Judicial anti- kidnapping division.]

What is it?

When did Mexican Customs start getting smart?

So how's business?

But don't you stay in El Paso?

You been working?

I've heard of it. Never happened to me though. Maybe the firing pin's off.

No.

Potential? I don't understand.

Pinta, do you have a pencil?

In the West, it's one wife for one husband, but different cultures have different rules.

You feel sorry for the husband?

What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?

I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.

You think too much?

That's strange. Frank was a no-show. Not like him to miss a ride.

Don't be a baby. You're tougher than that.

How are you getting along with Pinta?

You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.

Creasy... Wait.

The family paid the ransom and he was returned two days later.  His father still hasn't gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass.

If she pisses you off, you get another one.

[You have the money.]

[I need a driver to drive Samuel, the father.]

Good news. You're going back to school.

Yes, mom?

I like him, Mom.

I'll call you from Detroit, baby.

Our child's safety is at stake.

My wife, Mr. Creasy.

I've just been so busy, Lisa.

[Who's that?]

You helped him get this job.

Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you, others will do it as well. Their facilities are as good as my own, if not better.

Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to you. Tragic, a public outcry, but a number. One more dead.

You wanna have a drink before we start dancing?

Well, we oughta do something. It's Saturday night. I don't wanna go bowling like last Saturday. How about calling up that big girl we picked up inna movies about a month ago in the RKO Chester?

We took them home alla way out in Brooklyn. Her name was Mary Feeney. What do you say? You think I oughta give her a ring? I'll take the skinny one.

Well, let's call her up. What can we lose?

My old lady, every word outta her mouth, when you gonna get married?

It's early.

We gotta whole pot inna kitchen. We give you a plate-a your own.

Marty, let's go downna Seventy-Second Street area tonight.

Hello, Lou, Angie come in yet?

Who told you that?

I gotta pain in my left side, and my leg throbs like a drum.

Oh.

What they say?

Wadda you think?

I only got about three bucks on me now, but I just live about eight blocks from here on the other side of Webster Avenue. Why don't we walk back to my house? I'll run in, pick up some dough, and let's step out somewhere.

Siddown, take off your coat. You want something to eat? We gotta whole half-chicken in the icebox.

Waddaya doing New Year's Eve?

You say something?

Tommy, before you go, I wonder if you gimme a little advice.

I'm ugly... I'm ugly! I'm UGLY!

Hello, Marty, when you come home?

How'd you come home, Ma? Thomas give you a ride?

She's more than twenty-nine years old, Marty. That's what she tells you.

What are you talking about? She's a nice girl.

I don't like her.

I look over at this one nexta me, not bad, about thirty-five -- Hiya, Marty...

So, Marty, lemme tell you about these nurses, Marty...

Waddaya mean, Ralph?

All right, Ginnie, don't get so excited.

He says okay, it's all right Catherine comes here.

I just wanna thank you people again, because the situation was just becoming impossible.

Sure.

I'm sorry we gotta rush like this...

That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.

...You hadda be the boss inna kitchen alla time!

How they goin', Losing Preacher? What do you hear from the Pope?

What do I do with it Hawk? This is a little out of my line.

Good. You've both been working close to the front.

Stop him! Stop that man!

How you, Walt? We was just fixing to have a nightcap.

Pulse, slow, very little pressure.

She had this shiny black hair piled up on her head, but later on she let it hang loose and I'll be damned if it didn't come all the way down to her ass.

Y'all mind the store.

Because is not democrash? All peoples created equal?

I have great interest for America, his peoples and his custom.

There might be another tiny piece we missed. I want to look around before we close up.

What's the initials 'MP' stand for, Hawkeye?

Well, there it is. Jesus!

This kid's ready but we won't know all the damage till we get in and see what's happened. What have you got?

What's that?

Jesus to Jesus and eight hands around! Duke, did I ever tell you how I beat Dartmouth by intercepting a pass?

This kid looks like a loser. Maybe we better get the bead-jiggler to put in a fix.

Hail to the chief! We-all got a responsibility, men. He's crowned like a king ought to be, but he can't just walk to the Mess Hall by himself. He has to be carried by native bearers.

I guess that's why you go for Hot Lips Houlihan.

How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?

Don't try to get it far down. Kick it up high so we can get there and surround that son-ofa-bitch.

Henry's got our orders! We're going home!

There's no transportation anyway this time of night.

Let's hear from you, you goddam Yankee. Be nice to see you some time.

Ravenous. What about you?

You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.

I think I heard about that.

Must be fun. But the point we want to make about Henry...

Let me translate. I've had some exposure to the language. The young man is from Brooklyn and he wants us to vacate this vehicle.

Did I ever tell you about Me Lay Marston?

Please!  Face it, Colonel, you don't have us, we have you. Your boys blew this case, we bailed you out. We figure we ought to hang around a day to check the Congressman's kid, and we also figure to play some golf. So if that's okay with you, we got a deal.

Best thing you could do for all of us is grab some sack time.

Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.

It's five minutes into nurses' shower hour. Where are they?

But he's got five times the man-power to draw on.

Captain, I've been observing the nurses on your shift. But naturally your own opinion is more informed than mine.

Listen, we look pretty lousy out there, right?

What's the matter?

Thank you, Captain Pierce.  It's been so long.

Very happily married.

I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.

Even if I weren't.

How would he avoid it... as if I needed to ask?

It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high-pressure you.

There's this native broad works in the laundry. I don't know if you've noticed.

Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.

But it's all over now, and I can't face it. Imagine if you found out you were one, you wouldn't like breaking the news to your wife. Well, I got the same problem multiplied.

How much time do I have?

I have not understood what you means.

Pain bad, Ho-Jon?

Fifteenth straight day there've been six o'clock choppers. How long can a battle go on?

What's wrong with you?

We've got too many wounded for us to handle now! Get on the phone right away and...

To Major Burns' tent. Yes, sir.

Sir?

Good morning, Colonel.

Splendid, sir. No problems.

Those two big guys were tackles on the Cleveland Browns, and the redhead played halfback with the Rams.

Never mind.

Did you get it, too?

Before you do, Ann, perhaps you'd better finish this column.

Er, would you, er, would you like to make some money?

Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.

Yes!

Now, look, John. Here's the speech. It's in caps and double-spaced. You won't have any trouble reading it. Not nervous, are you?

Say, he's a friend of mine.

Hello, John.

How many people do you think we've talked to already, outside the radio, I mean?

Money?  Well, I'm glad to hear somebody admit it. Do you suppose you could write a radio speech that would put that fellow over?

Thank you very much for everything.

Better let me talk to him.

Oh, somebody else sitting there?

Oh! Oh, it's beautiful, D. B. WellI don't quite know what to say . . .

That's good.

Stick a fork through me! I'm done. I'll never get this speech right.

The Websters!

There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me.

Yeh, D. B. Oh, just cleaning out the dead-wood. Okay.

That's right. But you have a piece of property that still belongs to this newspaper. And I'd like to have it!

The letter.

You made it up.

Our John Doe! The one I made up! Look, genius Now, look. Suppose there was a John Doeand he walked into this office. What would you do? Find him a job and forget about the whole business, I suppose! Not me! I'd have made a deal with him!

You're supposed to be a smart guy! If it was raining hundred dollar bills, you'd be out looking for a dime you lost some place.

That's fine! That's fine!  Now fall right into their laps. Go ahead. Say John Doe walked in and called the whole thing off. You know what that's going to sound like on top of this!

I can read. I can read!

All right, boys, here he is.

What's the idea?

Now listen, Annhe can't possibly get in without our seeing him. I'm watching the side door and the Colonel's out front, so stop worrying.

Oh, stop worrying. He's all right.

What do you do when you work?

Hey, boss. Get a load of this.

Hey, whatsa matter with a bank account, anyway?

Hey, Doc, look. Look, Doc. Gimme that again, will yuh? Who's gonna get him?

Ba-ll!

Well, I'll be doggoned if over forty people don't show up. 'Course none of us knew what to do, but we sure got a kick out of seeing how glad everybody was just to say hello to one another.

Grubbel's here. See? 

A what?

It makes no difference, Bertthe ideas's still good. We don't have to give up our club.

That man is gonna be on that roof. Don't ask me how I know. I just know. And you know it as well as I do.

Gimme mine. I ain't staying! You know we were headed for the Columbia River country before all this John Doe business came up. You remember that, don't yuh?

Aw, Long John . . . I tell youit's no good. You're gonna get used to a lotta stuff that's gonna wreck you. Why, that fifty bucks in your pocket's beginning to show up on you already. And don't pull that on me neither! 

Tear down all the fences. Why, if you tore one picket off of your neighbor's fence he'd sue you!

Hello, Mr. Connell.

No, I never read the speeches before I make them. I get more of a kick out of it that way.

Now, that's all right, isn't it?

Sure.

Run a story. Say John Doe was in here, and is sorry he wrote the letter and

Why, certainly. With your ability to influence people, it might grow into a glorious movement.

Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold on! That's rather big talk! I started the John Doe clubs with my money and I'll decide whether or not they're being properly used!

That's a lie! Listendon't believe what he says . . .

Yes! I was paid! But the

Listen, folks, it's a fact that I didn't write the letter, but this whole thing started

She isn't?

Thanks. Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.

Oh, yeah. That's what I mean. See? It was easy as all that, huh?

Pretty good?  Say, I was just about ready for the major leagues when I chipped a bone in my elbow. I got it pitchin' a nineteen-inning game!

What are you doing? Get Connell at the Bulletin !  Why, he's liable to go right past my window,  What was that?!

I don't know.

No shit! He's good!

You gotta do this for me. I'm in here because of you.

Tell me what's wrong.

How can I help you with the particles?

What?!

Hold on a second here.

The suspect came in shortly after the bank opened. Botched robbery. A teller hit the silent alarm. He took seven hostages. Shot one -- the guard. He's still alive. So far he's asked for...

That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...

For now that's all.

Satisfied?

We're already past it, aren't we, Kevin?

What's the point of this?

Recruited you from where?

With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here?

Where did you hear that?

If you want to be a successful negotiator, you've got to learn to lie.

Yes.

See the favorite? Tail up. Washy. He doesn't want to run today. Cross him off... Now the Six looks good. On his toes. Coat shiny. This trainer/jockey combo does well. We can't leave him out.  What do you think?

Ronnie... Yeah, so.

The 6 horse is still last.

COME ON RUSSELL!...  Who the fuck's Russell?!

How long you been coming here?

Is it always like this?

See this. Solis has me driving the shit-mobile, and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand. Probably worth thirty.

What the fuck is going on.

Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.

And what if you can't live with it?

Mare Island is an abandoned shipyard, cranes, high buildings... he'll be in place where he can see everything.  How are we going to get me in there?

Have you evacuated anyone?

I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the room with the hostage, I have to stay.

Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her.

I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.

It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.

How's Paco doing?

How come in those foreign movies the young girl is always with some fat, old guy.

Scottie?

...the hell are you talking about?

It's Cozy Girl holding on... Cozy Girl and Backtrack...

Are you going to make this hard for me?

There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.

What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it?

It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.

You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.

The chief says to tell you how sorry he is. He knew Sam Baffert was a good man.

This is Halden.

What do you want?

They have nothing to do with this --

Why --

As long as it's not 'what's your sign?'

You were right.

But this is impossible.

What's happening?

It's time to wake up.

The patterns were moved around, but they weren't changed.

But what would happen to me?  I have no body to return to.

You are not a God.

The new world.

Where you plugged-in from?

Doesn't make sense.  How the hell does some fucking teenager get to the keys?

He had access to the keys --

You're jumping to conclusions.

What is it?

Christoph was in charge of designing building modules.

Not his style.

Insurance?

Someone you have to get back to?

We worked together on the inside. You were on my programming team --

And it meant something.

Care to tell us how you came into possession of an illegal access program?

Don't know what you're talking about.

It was just there.

We've got him locked!

Is this... food!

So how can we get to it?

He wants to know if you'd like a cube of sugar in your tea.

Aisha, you are the Bear, stalwart and bold.

We've come all this way for a rock wall?!

Anybody see anything?

Release the power WITH the power.

In a place that came to be known as Angel Grove.

Ay, yi, yi!  The Rangers are going to be CRUSHED!

You okay?

009843... 42... 41!  WE'RE IN ALIGNMENT!

Here you go!  No pushing!

Uh... that's classified, top secret, confidential, undercover information.

It's... an eagle?

Rrgh mmffpprr brghuh!!

How the heck?!...

Six become one... the combined forces of the Ninjetti.

I am the mighty ape!

But you know I never killed nobody that didn't deserve it.

If it wasn't important for everybody, we wouldn't ask. We got friends in Philly. They can send you up for a couple months on a weapons charge.

I remember reading a poem in college. "Sicily. Poor, noble isle...".

We have a commission. If there's a dispute over territory, the commission decides.

The commission don't decide how I spend my honeymoon.

Why should you be payin' me when we're all equals?

I had everything. Once.

Up down. Down up. It's the same. You see things through both eyes.

What do you mean?

We'll start small. When we got 'em lined up, we increase the supply a bit at a time. Only sell the best stuff. And keep the price high, 'cause ya know how folks hate the taste of cheap booze.

When the stiff's an Irish, the cops take it kinda personal.

Bastard didn't even show.

How much longer we gotta be shut up in this fuckin' sweatbox?

I think Maranzano's talkin' a hell of a deal.

A hundred-seven bucks too much. Any kid who drops an extra dime is gonna be talkin' to Moliari.

Well...

Have you thought about this?

If I look weak now, it's over.

Would it be painful for you?

Julius Caesar never took no vote.

I'll handle the Boss.

I'm glad ya come.

I got a place for you. In my family... or in the cemetery.

So fuck him. I don't care anymore. Let him come.

MONEY DON'T MEAN SHIT!

If I wanted ta kill ya, I woulda done it long ago. It's not like you ain't given me reason.

You can't fuck with them. They're heads of families!

We gotta talk in private. I got a friend in Coney Island who's gonna open his restaurant just for us.

One move pardner, and you're a dead man.

Good liquor draws a good crowd.

Salvatore. My young Caesar. First me, Sallie. Then you.

He's an animal!

If you give him the chance, Lansky will betray you like Judas.

I will be the Boss of All Bosses.

Tell it to the Calabrian. Tell it to the Jews.

Those fucks can't leave each other alone. Maranzano and Masseria ain't gonna be satisfied until one of 'em starts a war.

Sorry, Charlie. I gotta get my Johnson worked tonight.

Maranzano wants you dead.

Luciano is dead?

Jeez, Bugsy. Ya like ta scared the crap outta me.

The thing is, I'm responsible for the way he's acting. It's the nightmare juice. It's got to be.

Chasing me - animals - horrible -

I was, uh, just getting ready to leave...

DEATH!!

Vital signs have stabilized. That's good.

You're really gonna pop the question?

Go? There's a potload of money here, pal. You got three major toy companies...you got the guys from Burger God over here...

Herb, it's too much. It's all out of hand.

Holy shit.

You know, Julie, even if this works - which it probably won't - that stuff is tricky. You don't know what it'll do to his brain.

Uh huh. And?

It's a special kind of party. A <u>farewell</u> party. Do you...get what I'm saying?

Besides, Julie wouldn't...she'd never...

Stu, I like you personally, I admire your work, but I'm just the God of Sleep. This is Death's bailiwick.

It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!

The monkey, of course. It was his idea.

Oh, baby, I can't believe you're back.

Sure. Why?

And speaking of which, here's the light of my life, the pert and saucy Miss Julie McElroy.

Stu? Is that you? Where did you <u>go</u>?

Boy, the nuts are out tonight. What'd that creep call you - ?

Oh, Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming.

Oh, Julie...my poor Stu...my poor baby brother...

Kimmy, he doesn't know what's going on. He doesn't even know he's in a -

Kimmy! What's the matter?

Go. Just <u>go</u>.

You are too! Mooning over Julie when we could <u>both</u> be gettin' some o' this fine local action. It's not like she's gonna know. Out of town, under five minutes, and in a coma don't <u>count</u>.

I left my phone number in your undies. Try not to lose it in traffic.

He's taking her to the land of Death, right? So all we've gotta do is...hitch a ride! <i></i> Stop shaking! I'll protect you.

Where'd he go??

It's just...now that I'm leaving, I feel like there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay when I'm gone?

How are you doing sweetheart?

What about the fellow in those pictures?

Don, this is my mother.  Mom, this is my boss, Don Palmer.

No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?

Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.

You wouldn't be in the way.  I like having you around.

She's at work.  I'm her mother.

And there was this number on my phone bill that I didn't recognize.  Calls made at three and four in the morning.  So, I called the number ... and a woman answered.  And I ... I hung up.  So, then I followed him.  Just like in the movies.  And I found out that he has a wife and a little girl living in Brooklyn.  We had been going together for almost a year.

Really?

She would have come to the airport to meet me - she wanted to - but ... but, she just started a new job and, well, I guess no one drives here.

... And the children thought I should take a trip.

Forty-five?  I thought it was only supposed to be thirty?

The Majority Leader? Right over there. And that's [           ] the Minority Leader. They're both pretty good in the clinches.

And you say you never signed this contract with Mr. Allen?

You've never *seen* this contract.

What's he bringing pigeons for?

Tell me why!

Huh?

Kid--wait--what do you think you're going to do?

That gorilla in Man's clothing-- McGann.

The Silver Knight. Soul of Honor--on a tight-rope.

What dame?

Diz--

You--you've been a good egg, Diz. Maybe we could clear out of this town--get to feel like *people*--get the habit of lifting up our eyes-- live like we just got out of a tunnel.

Yeah--that's right. Diz--

Don't say "okay," Diz. Say you think it's beautiful.

Hey! We're gettin' married--!

He's cooked! They'll drum the poor lug out of that chamber tomorrow as sure as I'm--! And now they're all down on him. Yeah--my press pals, too--he's a bad egg--still water running deep. Boloney! It's the frame of all time! When I see a phoney like this--my journalist blood boils-- I wanna *fight*!  Look, kid--rack your brains, will you? Haven't you got any confidential stuff on that mob? I'll write my arm off--I'll blow Taylor and his--

The war's on!

Diz!

Dinner, Hubert.

Really, my dear--I don't feel like a thing.

Good. Are the newspaper men at the hotel?

Fine. The first thing to do is-- present Mr. Smith to the press--in the *right* way. Hurry him along, Bill.

Yes, yes--tell them I'll see them immediately--immediately!  I can't hold them off! They want something to say about this appointment. Ten to one they've got a man.

I *can't* wait, McGann! You go into that room and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine that I give them *one more minute*--

Terrific! A born stooge! Horace'll perform like a trained seal.

Not at all. I've come to pay you a personal and official--and I might say--a *tardy* tribute, Mr. Smith, for your recent heroic conduct.

I *thought* I heard... Yes?

Well--it started with a little mimeograph sheet--and it's just grown out of all sense and reason--

A pet shop?

Gee, I wouldn't appoint an old twerp like Horace Miller--Taylor or no Taylor!

Where were you?

I addressed the Chair first, sir!

Well, it isn't much, but if you insist, here's this week's. 

I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?

I mean, sir--if I'm going to stay in the Senate--I ought to know what I'm doing--at least, I ought to try to study the Bills that are coming up--

But--there are a hundred other places in the state that *need* the water. Besides--I talked to Kenneth Allen, who owns some of that land--and he didn't say anything about a dam. No-- I'm sure, sir--there's something wrong--and I--I won't vote on this thing until I get a lot of questions answered--

Yield *how*, sir?

It does!

Mr. President! A point of order!

Well now--just to take an example-- putting up a dam--on Willet Creek. As I look at it--that dam's going to do the people of our state a lot of good--

But you have some objections here and there. And maybe right, for all I know. But the point is--there's no sense stopping the whole works now-- specially after some men have worked hard for a long time to put this through--

What is it?

Gee--I'm sorry about that, Miss--you *are* Miss Saunders, aren't you?

I don't believe I've been so thrilled in my--oh, and that Lincoln Memorial! Gee! There he is--Mr. Lincoln--looking right at you as you come up the steps-- sitting there like he was waiting for someone to come along--

No, gee--I couldn't stay here--

Pardon me. Senator Paine decided this *with* you?

My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?

A *day*!

Good. Where are we?

Do you really think we're getting anywhere.

A committee of the majority party leaders. They decide when a Bill is important enough to be moved up toward the head of the list--

No! Go right ahead, Miss Saunders.

--that's the main idea, Miss Saunders. The United States Government isn't going to buy or build this camp-- just lend us the money. You've made a note of that, huh?

On paper?

You mean--here?

I take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh--

Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders.

You--you've *got* a first name, haven't you?

Uh--Willet Creek. It's just a little stream--

What do they--? Who are all those--?

Get your hat, Senator. We've got a lot to do between now and tomorrow--

What are you going to do?

Well, I guess it's a chance.

A camp! Well!

*Gentlemen*! Gentlemen are supposed to believe in something decent. Instead of twisting facts and making a joke of everything--why don't you tell the people the *truth* for a change?

Well, goodbye, sir--and thank you again.  Well--it--it was nice seeing you, Miss Paine--

Uh--that's good. And--uh--you?

That's--that's splendid.

Oh, the bill. Oh--splendid--I mean--  I--I just can't seem to talk in this suit.  I'll tell you a secret. It's brand new.

"--We hold these truths to be self- evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights--"  Well--looks like the night shift's comin' on.

I said--I mean--Washington didn't live to see it finished. Congress didn't move here from Philadelphia till eighteen hundred.

Yes. Washington laid the cornerstone though--wearing an apron for the ceremony that was embroidered by Madame Lafayette--

Marvelous! And what would this camp set the Government back?

Well! Hear anything? Any sign of him?

What! Who?

H'ya, Carl--h'ya, Bill!

Chick--

--amazing coincidence! Of all places in the world--to choose Willet Creek for his boys' camp!

My daughter isn't here to carry out assignments like that for *anybody*.

Jim's methods won't do in Washington.

--I've used every argument in the world to try to turn him off. He just keeps coming back to the dam-- and what he knows--

What do I *mean*, huh? Uh--*I'll* tell ya--World's Series--a pass! In a month it's worth fifteen bucks!

And I'm an old hand at following instructions--

Yeah--I see I'm right where I've been for seven years--

What do you want, Senator?

All right--*yes*! And what does that make me to him? *Nothing*! I've got to go about my own business--and forget it!

That Happy Hopper is tougher to handle than a prima-donna.

Joe, that's coming a long way in twenty years since I met you practising law down there in Main Street.

Wait a minute, boys. Happy may have hit on something tremendous here. Rather than let Miller or anyone else in at this stage, we simply put blinders on this simple son of nature-- and turn him loose on monuments. He's completely out of the way in Washington, and as Happy says, you make political capital out of it at home.

A young patriot?--Who recites Jefferson and Lincoln?--turned loose in our nation's capital? I think I can.

That's him. Let him in.

You won't stand for it?

Mr. President! Will the Senator yield?

Will the Senator yield?

Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?

Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking about?

Since he was born.

He sure is pixilated.

He's still pixilated.

Are you married?

Any children?

You don't go out with girls very much, do you?

I don't mind though. I had a lot of fun doing it.

It's obviously a frameup! They're trying to railroad this man for the money they can get out of him!

Thank you, Your Honor. Are you employed by the Morning Mail?

Are these the articles?

But they did take place?

You are , aren't you?

No, thank you. I'll be all right.

You've been having quite an exciting time here, haven't you?  All those meetings and business deals and society people - haven't you been having fun?

Look - there's Brookfield, the poet.

Sure. I met you.

Would you like to walk the rest of the way? It's so nice out.

There you are. Grant's Tomb. I hope you're not disappointed.

I say, to most people it's a washout.

Oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers, you know.

Really?

He played in the town band, too.

The drums. He taught me to play some.

Couldn't sleep. Kinda wanted to talk to you. Do you mind?

I didn't think you could come with the party and everything.

All my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl.

Well, here we are again.

Would you like to read it? It's to you.

People have been crucified before.

You started out to be a successful newspaper woman, didn't you?

You're a fool, Babe.

Look, I can do it!

Can I have a month's vacation?

With pay!

Proposed to you! You mean he asked you to marry him?

Sorry, Babe. Sorry. It would have made a swell story. I just got carried away. That's too bad. So he proposed to you, huh?  What a twist! You set out to nail him - and he

What're you going to do?

This is for you , Mac. The names of all the headwaiters in town. You can always buy a bit of choice scandal from them at reasonable prices.

Ow! My foot's asleep!

Is that the best you've got?

He's not home, I tell you!

Nuisance value?

You will please permit Mr. Deeds to finish.

Newspaperman?

That's pretty.

Okay, then. Go to it.  And, Charlie

Find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away.

Are your parents living?

Well, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing. He left everything to us. He traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. You should do the same thing, Mr. Deeds.

Yes. That is to say

He's capable of causing you a lot of trouble, Mr. Deeds.

Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?

Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington.

Gee, I'm busy. Did the opera people always come here for their meetings?

Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately. How would you like yours? Dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender?

Women! Ever heard of 'em?

Arthur! Who's Arthur?

Just as I suspected, wise guy! I don't mind you making a sap out of yourself - but you made one out of me, too.

Cobb! Get lunch for the rest of them.

Why, it's an artistic institution

Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.

Now, where were we?

Why not?

It reminds me very much of this one. Nicht wahr?

my wife wanted me to tell you she  she prays for you every night.

Sorry to keep you waiting so long. Those opera people are funny. They wanted me to put up $180,000.

Of course, we don't want to appear greedy, Mr. Deeds.

I say we don't want to appear greedy.

No.

That ought to be fun.

Where is your farm?

You're Mabel - her sister - aren't you?

Get up from there. I don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants. Get up from there!

He talks about women as if they were cattle.

Yes, sir.

A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10]

You kept searching me last night, sir. Going through my pockets. You said you were looking for a rhyme for Budington.

Madame Pomponi is on the telephone, sir.

Madame Pomponi. She says everything is all set for the reception.

Me, sir?

Why are they ganging up against me?

I said... you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday.

I had ordered some books. "The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written."

It's irrelevant. It had nothing to do with what happened.

Her friend from the city came and took her out to dinner. First time in a long time she's been willing.

What Ernest means, I think, is we're very interested in other methodology... different kinds of training. We're great believers in learning from each other. I've learned so much from Ern -- Dr. Delbanco...

But they're certainly dead. And yes, personally, I find it a bit odd.

Interesting approach. What was his name?

Well... you see, when I broke it off with Phyllis, she was naturally upset and she became more determined than ever to pursue certain -- how to put it -- doubts she's been harboring...

Why not?

Why? I'm paying for this.

You find it distasteful, don't you?

What's that?

Let me just say something here... I have no idea if this is going to help.

-- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way --

I didn't see you there. Can I help you?

No thanks. Plenty of time for that when we're a little further along.

We've done... very well. You know anything about addiction, Doc?

Mr. White, I am frustrated that the criminal code in this state allows a maximum sentence of only six months and a maximum fine of only $2000.

Yeah... me you, too... I was at your house...

So, is this like a Japanese restaurant?

It was Henry Follett.

How long you been in this town?

How ya doin', Ainge? Evenin', Lily.

Maybe some of us don't need this crap!

Hello, Lionel.

It's a country club. Don't worry about it.

But you know how to drive?

I been drivin' since I was twelve.

Can you help Mom?

Do you think that's a good idea?

It'll never happen! You're in big trouble, mister.

Well, look who's here...

Sofie. It's so obvious... you're after my daughter.

What can you tell me about this?

Hmm? Is that a professional opinion?

We don't discuss it.

Sore throat?

I can give myself a headache instantly.

There... I've given myself a real whopper.

...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.

Is that when you split up?

So whose route is this?

It's all right.

And this is legitimate therapy?

I need to talk to you... Doctor. Can I come in?

Transference!

But, there is one... mitigating factor I want you to consider before you write me off.

Will you think about it?

Don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.

I don't think you know what you're talking about.

...What balls on this guy? What're we...  ...going steady? Jesus.

You're Doc Mumford.  Skip Skipperton.

All right, I'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as I can.  And you understand that this is a big secret? Just between us?  Okay. You know I've got this gift for certain kinds of... machines.

Guess.  Go ahead, guess!

Sounds like kind of a good idea.

Who else knows?

But there was one job that looked like it might be fun -- Investigator.

Of course, him being insane didn't make it all right that I fell in love with his wife.

But look at me now...

I wish I could live in the shower. I'd take five a day if I had the time. I went to this spa in Germany, a sanitarium practically, up on this mountain. And the great thing -- they just kept you wet all day.

How'd you do it?  The new you.

Jeez, man. But you're good at it!

It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up.

Lily.

Doc!... It's not me, is it?

Hmm. I guess that doesn't help... I see where you're going here. It's a mess.

It's possible. I don't know about that.

I never killed a priest before.

And how does one do that?

Altar boys?

What then? Robbery? Extortion? Kidnapping!

My very good friend! What a surprise.

Ten to one, O'Connell, your odds are no-so-good.

Then you got no excuse for living. What the hell you doin, being buddies with this creep, Beni? What's in it for you?

In the necropolis, when I saw him, - alive,... walking, he called me Anck- su-namun. And then in Mister Burns' quarters he tried to kiss me.

I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life --

Then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her.

I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here.

So your sayin', if we find the book made outta gold --

And what is he in prison for?

And what did he say?

Are you saying this filthy godless son of a pig knows where to find The City Of The Dead? Truly?

-- I know what you mean. I was there, alright. Seti's place. The City Of The Dead.

Did I miss something? Are we going into battle?

Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, they call it, "the doorway to hell."

I don't believe in fairy tales and hokum, Mister O'Connell, but I do believe that one of the most famous books in history is buried out there, The Book Of The Living. It's what first interested me in Egypt as a child. It's why I came here, sort of a life's pursuit.

That "thing" gets me excited.

Unlike your brother, Miss, you I don't get. You're a whole new brew.

Why would I do that?

No... Why?... Should I?

Oh my god, I've dreamed about this ever since I was a little girl.

Having an encounter with a four thousand year old walking-talking corpse tends to convert one.

It's everybody's problem!

That's what I am to you? A contract?

He's here! I saw him! That thing is here!

I think you were jealous

Got guts, lady.

Jonathan?

I'm your sister.

You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?!

I can't believe I allowed the two of you to get me drunk.

Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now what is this last symbol here?

That thing gives me the creeps.

You did not!?... We're not!?

Believe it, sister. That's what brought our buddy back to life.

We gotta get her back.

Okay, now what the hell does this Horus guy look like?

The jig is up, Casanova. I've spent six months watching you, and know exactly what you're up to.

Everything's going exactly as we planned.

And then one day, he didn't come home. The police said it was an accident. But cargo containers don't just fall on people. He was murdered... After that I fell apart. I dropped out of school, became a mud wrestler, married and divorced a jerk. When my mother died I hit bottom... but then, when I was cleaning out her attic, I found my father's old bowling bag and costume, almost like he'd left them there for me... and I knew what I had to do.

We didn't think this through very well.

How about... the Savage Six?

Sounds good to me.

I'll let you in on a little secret, Roy. In two days this entire city will belong to me, and there's not a damn thing your little pals can do about it. It's the perfect time to switch teams... So what do you say?

Are you an actress?

You know I'm writing a play -- it's just a little Broadway thing, but there's a part in it that I think you'd be perfect for.

How 'bout giving me "the tour"?

Yeah.

I admire you.

Most people just want to make money or be famous or something. But you risk everything, just to help people.

Me too... I love this stupid old town. It's noisy. It's smelly. It's falling apart.

I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or New York, but...

Just shut up and listen. Hold off the attack as long as you can. If I can discover the location I'll call you --

So how do you know that you've ever been invisible?

But now Casanova's back! And we're gonna sit around here all night eating pizza and telling stories! Hey, lets toast some marshmellows!

Maybe. But this isn't about living or dying. It's about good versus evil, and we're good, whether we like it or not... Maybe we look a little funny...

We're all the same really. Our songs, our dreams, our seeds are all just a brave attempt to live forever. 

What are you talking about?

You sure that's how you spell it?

The who?

Sounds good.

Roy, remember, it is all within your power. The only thing that's in your way... is you.

He's turned into a completely normal person!

So what can I get you?

Oh, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take this anymore. Night after night we're on the streets, busting our humps -- and for what?

Or Batman --

Twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil, and Casanova was their king.

Oh no.

It is a thing entirely unknown in diplomacy, that one government should assume a right to dictate to another, who is upon terms of equality, the conditions on which she should conduct her commerce; and, assuming such a right, second it by threatening language, in case of non-compliance.

My dear Caulaincourt, agreements can endure only when they allow both sides to live.  Napoleon may believe it is necessary to injure England but, before that, he must realize it is necessary for him to allow his friends to live.  He cannot expect me to tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring England to her knees -- and I'm afraid that is what it has come to.

I hope you will forgive me, Your Majesty, for requesting an audience at such a late hour, but I have traveled all the way from Moscow to see you, on a matter which cannot wait.

If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion.

The point I was trying to make is that I think it is reasonable to say that Your Majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure, if he decided to make peace with the Emperor, at least at this time.

If he withdraws his army in good order, it will be a serious political defeat.  But, if he should be caught on the move, with his army, in the full grip of winter, then it will be a catastrophe.  If Your Majesty can prolong his hopes for a treaty by silence, be deceit, by any means, for another month, thus postponing his departure, then the graves of his army are already dug in the soil of Russia.

Ah -- you approve?

Please...

I don't even know whether a defense is possible.

Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons.

These are odds of 8 to 1.

In every practical sense, yes, but, officially, of course, I would have to retain command.

Well, Belliard, what's this?  What are you doing here?  Where is the enemy?

And where is the army?

But did she have the best doctors? Wasn't there any chance at all to save her?

Captain Charles, I believe you are one of General Le Clerc's aides-de- camp.

Did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip?

You will return to Paris tomorrow and you will carry my compliments and thanks to General Le Clerc for assigning such an excellent officer to carry out a responsibility which has meant so much to myself and to Madame Bonaparte.

Yes, sir.  I hope you will excuse me for asking, General Bonaparte, but are you Corsican?

I thought so, I noticed your name when you were announced.  I'm Corsican too -- my name is Arena.

Good heavens, Ambassador -- what has happened?

The Emperor has decided to marry your Archduchess, Marie-Louise.

That is correct.

Does your mother know you have come?

Well, then, you have a lot of initiative, my young friend.

Ah, my dear Francis, what a genuine pleasure it is to meet you at last.

Shall we move closer to the fire?

Will Alexander be joining us soon?

But he asked me to say...  on his behalf... that your achievements have increased his...  admiration for you, and that he believes... your success is predestined by heaven...  and that his army...

I'm afraid I am, just a bit.

Thank you, Napoleon.

No -- not as a rule.

Good evening, sir.

Then what brings you out on such a night?

Uh-hh... yes, of course -- if you would like to go... there... but... I have very little money.

I would like both of you to read this.  Please read it aloud.

Naturally, one does not take much stock in such a piece of filth but, on the other hand, it is not the sort of thing one can simply ignore. What do you think, Joseph?

Yes, of course, I would.  You know I am not one of your wife's greatest admirers, but I certainly know nothing about this.

The important thing is to find the right lawyer.  One who will not protract the thing indefinitely, in the courts.

Are you sure that you are not still in love with her?

Oh... how very nice of you to bring that for Eugene... Did General de Beauharnais give it to you?

Were you in love with any of them?

Were any of them prettier than I am?

She must have been in love with you.

Yes -- what is it?

How should I know.  Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress.

I will be there in five minutes.  Go back to your guests.

But you will not... be safe...

Why did you give it to him?

Nothing.  That's all I can say.

Yes.

Do you know what you're saying?

I was in her maid's room at an inn we stopped at for the night, outside of Dijon.  It was an adjoining room to Madame Bonaparte's.

How did you know it was Captain Charles?

Are you trying to provoke me, monsieur?

Good evening, ladies.  You must forgive me, my dearest wife, but I simply could not wait to see you.

You are so good to me.  Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?

I hope you have patience with me.  I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn.

England can make no move against you on the Continent without Austria.  A reliable treaty with Austria would end her hopes in that regard.

I hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is, sire. My impression of Alexander is that he is moody and impressionable, capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments.  He is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity.  You have dazzled him, and you have performed a diplomatic miracle, but Alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear.

Sire, you have only enemies in the court of St. Petersburg, and I fear outside your influence, Alexander will have another look at what he has agreed to.

I suggest that you leave with your men while you can.

Is he alone?

His moods at this time were complex and varied.

On December 2, 1804, Napoleon was made Emperor of France.  He would later say:  "I found the crown lying in the gutter and I picked it up."

On January 1st, 1814, France itself was invaded.  Now, with a small army of raw recruits, Napoleon would have to face the powerful combination of England, Russia, Prussia and Austria, operating against him together, for the first time.  The balance of numbers had tilted irretrievably against him.

Yo' cousin, Craig.  Hook us up.

Hey, Debo, heard you running from a ass- whippin'?

Me, too.  You think they're in there?

That's a nice piece of heat right there.

Sorry, bro, reflexes.  How did you do that?

Fuck, what's his name?

Nobody!

Yep.  I forgot about him cussin' out everybody.  Damn that was fun.

They ever let you hit the switches on that Cadillac?

Must be nice.  I wish we won the lottery. Come up on a million dollars like ya'll.

What's the matter with your girlfriend?

So.

It says we owe $3,900...by tomorrow.

To the Cucamonga shopping center.

I got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me.

Next time, page me first.

Can I help you?

You coming in?

You see that?

Two bullets?  Yo' ass ain't changed. Back in the day, all I had was a stick.

What kind of activity?

See you later, Day-Day.  Come by after work, I got the John Blaze shit for you.

Craig, this Roach.  Roach, this is my cousin, Craig.

That the big one, huh?

Are they still out there?

Today ain't my day.

Roach, what are you doing?

Hey.

Get 'em, Craig!

Ah damn.  Damn.

What the fuck you looking at?

Get on.

Here's the plan.  You gonna call over there and say you have a very urgent message for Mr. William Jones.

When?  After you get all drunk and loaded?

Are you going to take me to see Mom?

Somebody left me a message.  Well where's Craig and Day-Day?

Mr. Nasty time?

Where to, sir?

Good luck.

Is this about those kids? Look, I'm sorry about that. But they darn near...

Come with us, sir.

I will do no such thing.

How should I...?

I'm not stupid.. I know how this is supposed, to work.

I talk to her or you can forget about it.

My wife always said I had a problem trusting people.

Lynn!

Yes, sweetie, it's me.

No, honey, not to be a hero. But I want you to remember something for me, all right?

All right. Kisses to you.

You remember me?

Please...

Cover your mouth.

Why don't you tell me about the early years some other time?

You stole that.

This is what they call the jack. Hi, Jack!

Where is he? Did you lose him?

That one.

Skate-boarders I don't mind, even though they dress like fuckin' idiots, but when I see some pin-head on rollerblades, I get the definite urge to grease the grill of my car with 'em.

You don't want to cause a ruckus, with the little girl and all.

And what happens if I don't call you?

That's enough.

Think of it, Ben! With that cursed, bloodied gold!

I come not with Peace but with a Sword.

Here they come.

'Twas down at Cresap's Landing, Along the River Shore, Birdie Steptoe was a Pilot in the good old days of yore. Now he sets in his old wharf-boat...

Leavin', boy?

Can we eat him, Uncle Birdie?

Uncle Birdie!

I'll light the lamp.

The Lord said, Take that money and throw it in the River!

Who?

Just went?

Is he hit pretty bad?

Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.

Willa Harper there is certain plain facts of life that adds up just like two plus two makes four and one of them is this: No woman is good enough to raise growin' youngsters alone! The Lord meant that job for two!

If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!

I must wend my way down River on the Lord's work.

Amen! Amen!

My dear, dear friends! Whatever would I do without you!

Just a man.  Goodnight Pearl, sleep tight; and don't let the bedbugs bite.

Now can I tell?

It's all here.

Now listen to me, Pearl. You and me is runnin' off tonight.

Your mother says you tattled on me, boy. She says you told her that I asked you where that money was hid.

I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut --

Now: Where?

Yes; John's bad.

Surely. I'd like to talk to you, my dear.

Why, you're the purtiest girl I've seen in all my wandering. Didn't nobody never tell you that, Ruby?

Mister Powell?

Didn't you have no inkling?

The first night?

She'll come draggin' her tail back home.

John: take that look offen your face and act nice.

Mornin', ladies.

What'd you all talk about?

They're just simple tests, Nan. We'll both be right here.

Not to worry. No signs of pathology in Nancy's EEG or pulse rate. I'd guess what we've got is a normal young girl who just happens to have gone through two days of hell.

So we'll guard her together. Through the night.  In each others' arms like we always said.

Why's she so bothered by a stupid nightmare, anyway?

What the hell's going on!?

They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'. So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right?

And what if they meet a monster in their dream? Then what?

Hello?

Me?  Wait a minute, you can't bring someone out of a dream!

Meanwhile...?

How you doing, pal?

Only family allowed, Nancy. You know the drill.

He's dangerous.

That'll be exactly half past midnight. Time for me to fall asleep and find him.

DAD! GET US OUTTA HERE!

What's the Coroner got to say?

Tell her I'm not here, tell her...

Right home after.

What?

Mother, for petesakes.

And no school tomorrow, either. You take a little vacation, relax and rest for a change.

Take this, it'll help you sleep.

Did you ask Daddy to have the hat examined?

What I learned at the dream clinic, that's what I'm trying to prove. Rod didn't kill Tina, and he didn't hang himself. It's this guy -- he's after us in our dreams.

Mom, I want to know what you know about Fred Krueger.

Bunch of us parents tracked him down after they let him go. Found him in an old boiler room, just like before. Saw him lying there in that caked red and yellow sweater he always wore, drunk an' asleep with his weird knives by his side...

How could somebody get under the covers with you guys without you knowing it?

What you mean 'all at once'?

Do you think I did it?

Rod says the sweetest things.

No more fights?

They didn't let me. I am in disgrace. Last week at the performance of Carmen I played a sour note. The conductor got so excited he yelled, "There's sabotage in the string section!"

I know... my heart is sad... but my feet are happy. When all the tanks and guns were roaring over the Red Square I sat here all by myself and played a Beethoven sonata. Not bad at all.  Are you expecting someone?

When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.

Are we free, Buljanoff?

No, that's not him...

Imagine, for once in our lives we were in Paris and we never went to the Eiffel Tower.

If you hadn't given Commissar Razinin such a wonderful report about us, who knows what would have happened?

It is, Ninotchka! It is! He must have been in Paris! You can see it in his whole attitude! He just picked up a crumb of our black bread, shook his head, and dropped it.

Just a minute -- just a minute -- I have nothing against the idea but I still say let's go back to the Hotel Terminus. Moscow made our reservations there, we are on an official mission, and we have no right to change the orders of our superior.

Now Comrades, I warn you... if it gets out in Moscow that we stay in the Royal Suite we will get into terrible trouble.

Capitalistic methods...

And Leonitchka! What she said about us...!

Let's not close our eyes. There are many good things to see here too.

It is high time you got out of Russia.

All you have to do is say "open sesame."

You think because you represent the former Duchess...

Not that we are giving in one inch, but tell us... what is in your mind?

Didn't we put up a strong resistance?

Boys, boys... don't forget Russia is your mother country. Three sons walking out all at once... that's too much for any mother.

A blue shirt, perhaps?

I am, Gaston.

Ah, there's something poetic about the simple processes of labor. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet... it should be set to music!

Isn't there any revolt in you? Sometimes when I order you around don't you feel like kicking me in the pants?

Good evening, Your Highness.

Leon, my little boy.

...des petites fraises des bois... de la crème de Bretagne... 

That was our idea when we first came. All we thought we would get out of this trip was a Turkish bath, but... we learned better.

There's something in Constantinople... something irresistible....

Well, gentlemen... how about a little lunch?

Bad news?

You've done it again and I am responsible. How can you forget yourselves this way? You were sent here to make money, not to spend it.

Yes, monsieur?

We dealt directly with the representative of the Grand Duchess. I am sure if we call him he will give you a very clear picture.

I'm sorry, gentlemen. The other day I heard such a funny story...  It still makes me laugh. It is very funny.  I am sorry. Oh yes... about this injunction...

Give me another double brandy.

She must have her little joke.  You're not going to take that seriously.

Listen, I want to be absolutely frank with you. I have no business in Moscow.

You, please.

Love to.

Technical... I couldn't help you from that angle. You see, a real Parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off.

I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?

Suppress it.

For my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale?

The foundation is one hundred and forty-one yards square...  I hope you'll forgive me but I thought you'd...

Do not misunderstand me. I do not hold your frivolity against you.  As basic material you might not be bad, but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture. I feel sorry for you.

I see a house that looks like any other house. What's remarkable about it?

Good evening, comrade.  This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.

What do we do now?

I should say this room is eighteen by twenty-five.

That is why I believe in the future of my country.

Your general appearance is not distasteful.

You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic.

You repeat yourself.

It's midnight. One half of Paris is making love to the other half. Look at the clock. One hand has met the other hand. They kiss. Isn't that wonderful?

Thank you.

I must go.

Let's forget that we ever met.

As a representative of Moscow...

Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice.  When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?

Just smile.

Because we are an odd couple.

On which boat?

It seemed funny to me when I first heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you!

Not funny, huh?

I'll tell you that joke again. A man comes into a restaurant. Did you get that?

Well, first I should like to take off my hat and jacket.  Then could we have some music?

No... go on.

From what I read I thought champagne was a strong drink. It's very delicate. Do people ever get drunk on this?

How do you do?

Go on.

Our salute will be a kiss.

I have paid the penalty. Now let's have some music.

There it is... Thursday... you can't rip it out of the week....

Is this the wish of the masses?

Don't you find that restful?... Why didn't you come last night?

Did you win?

Those newspaper people?

What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!

First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman?

This is the Duchess Swana... I want to speak to Monsieur Cornillon... it's very important... please get him right away... Hello, Monsieur Cornillon? The most incredible thing has happened! My jewels are here in Paris! Three Bolshevik swine are trying to sell them! Yes... yes... we must act immediately!... Call the police... Have them arrested!... Well, then, get an injunction!... But do something, Monsieur Cornillon!  ...But they are my jewels! There must be some way of getting them back!

Yes, Swana.

Yes, Swana, you did.

Did I act stupidly last night? Should I apologize?

Oh, no, my little Volga boatman. Have you forgotten our First Commandment: Never Complain -- Never Explain. It has worked so often and so perfectly, don't let's break the rule. And please don't look so guilty, otherwise I'll...

All right, I'll listen.

The same old trouble, Leon. You're always late. Whether you're taking me to the Opera or calling for me at a beauty shop, you're never on time. And now, when it's a question of your reform -- late again.  By about five minutes.

She's gone, Leon.

Not at all.... I understand perfectly, Count d'Algout gave you a dog. You made it very clear, madame.

Isn't it amazing! One gets a wrong impression of the new Russia.  It must be charming. I'm glad conditions are so improved. I assume this is what the factory workers wear at their dances?

Don't worry, you were quite rude enough.  Do you mind if I let in a little fresh air and sunshine? I'm sure it will make you feel better and I want you to be at your very best. In full possession of your faculties, at least.

You can't deny we gave the people their money's worth -- almost -- eight tumbling Romanoffs -- eight!

Where are they?

You leave me no choice.

My lawyer agrees with you. He says France will uphold it in every court, but I will drag you through every court, don't forget that. And when I say it will take two years I am, as always, conservative.

Good morning, Comrade.

You mean you have finished the whole investigation?

That's marvelous.... You must have worked day and night.... Don't you ever sleep?

Well, Comrade, I am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else.

Well, Comrade, have you heard from your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff?

Oh, they shouldn't do such things. Are you sure this report is correct?

I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.

I think this is the first time you have been to my little place. Your face is new to me. Now, what shall it be?

Bring me something simple. I never think about food.

I remember one birthday of His Majesty, our beloved Czar... I had the honor of being on guard at the summer palace... I still see you bending before His Majesty... You wore your diadem and a necklace... your face seemed to be lighted by the jewels.

I am sorry... I have to leave.

You're lawyers.  How can you let this shit go by!  Look!  This?  Nixon can't say this.

For Christ's sake, it soils my mother's memory.  Do you think I want the whole goddamn world to see my mother like this?  Raising a dirty mouth!

The bigger problem I see is this guy who was arrested, McCord -- James McCord -- he headed up security for the Committee to Re-Elect.  He turns out to be ex-CIA.

Executive clemency ...

Mitchell?  Mitchell's ... family.

I'm still not confident we can ride through this.  Some people are going to have to go to jail.  Hunt's not the only problem.  Haldeman let me use the $350,000 cash fund in his safe to make the payments.  Ehrlichman had a role, a big role, in the Ellsberg break-in. And I'm ... uh, I think it's time we begin to think in terms of cutting our losses.

To protect his people.

Yeah ... Sullivan thinks Henry's leaking.  He's the one ...

He's wrong, you know -- about Kennedy, LBJ, Truman.

They went after Castro.  In some crazy way it got turned on Kennedy.  I don't think the "P" knows what happened, but he's afraid to find out.  It's got him shitting peach pits.

Hunt?  Howard Hunt?

Where's Hunt now?

Pay him.

It's more than that.  It could be more than that.  I want Hunt paid.

The country's loving it.

I don't know, I don't know ... I just know we've made too many enemies.

... an action that will at last, once and for all, show that what I knew and what I did with regard to the Watergate break-in and cover-up were just as I have described them to you from the very beginning ...

Three days before, on the June twentieth tape -- the one with the eighteen-minute gap --

... they smelled the blood on me this time, Al.  I got soft.  You know ... that rusty, metallic smell ...

On the list of horribles, I know what he is.  And I know what he tracks back to.  You say he was involved in the Plumbers?

I had nothing to do with that.  Was he ... in the Ellsberg thing?

Fucking hell.

Meanwhile, what happens to the country?

The first assassination attempt was in '60, just before the election.

... and we've got the economic guys at five.  The Dow lost another 16 points. They're going to want a decision on the budget.  Sir?  ... Are we holding the line on a balanced budget?

But, hell, this is nothing compared to Venezuela.  When I was Vice President, Ike sent me down there like a blocking back.  They threw rocks, broke out our windows, almost overturned the car. Read Six Crises, Bob.  Boy, Pat was brave!

And his staff.  Come on, the copy they were filing from China was great.

The Jews aren't the middle, Henry. They're the far left.

Because they're not Americans.

You know why they're turning on me? They're not serious about power, that's why.  They're playing with power.  They're forgetting the national interest.  In the old days, people knew how to hold power, how to set limits.  They wouldn't have torn this country apart over a third-rate burglary. All they care about now are their egos, looking good at cocktail parties ...

You played it perfectly, sir -- cocksucker!  He's going to think twice before he leaks again.

We've got to turn the faucet off on this thing.  It's out of control ...  You might burden just me with this in the future.

I see ... Well then, Richard, we have nothing more to talk about, do we?

I can't ...

Hey ... you'll be able to do it now.

Mom expects great things from you ...

I'm honored, Dick, that you've come all this way out here to Virginia to visit us at last.

And me? ...

And of course I accept.  I'm flattered.  And I want you to know, I work for only one president at a time.

Are you tapping Kissinger?

No.

Ummm...

You'll win the nomination.

The little bastards think they can ruin Tricia's wedding day by dancing naked in the Reflecting Pond.

How the fuck did you know?

You're fucking me.

Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed.

By the way, Jack, this looks like a pretty straight-forward transaction to me, but we should get into it soon -- just take a few minutes, maybe up at the house ...

Hell, Kennedy's pissed Cuba away to the Russians.  And he don't know what the hell he's doing in Vietnam.  These are dangerous times, Dick, especially for business ...

Only if Kennedy dumps Johnson.

And whose fault is that?  If we'd won in Vietnam ...

Desi's got a point.  What the hell are we gonna do about the Communists right here in our backyard?!

Who are you talking to like this, you insignificant shit ...

All kinds of shit would come out. Like the Ellsberg thing.  You knew about that, Henry, didn't you?

Yes, you always had a good sense of timing, Henry.  When to give and when to take. How do you think Mao, Brezhnev will react?  Do you think this is how they'll remember me, Henry, after all the great things you and I did together? As some kind of ... of ... crooks?

You have many friends ... and admirers ...

Secret, Mr. Chairman?

Yes.

I don't know.  He made me see the stars ...

We can prosecute the New York Times, go for an injunction ...

The lie?

You're the one who should be in politics, John.  You're tougher than I am.  You never crack.

Let's get out of here; it's too painful.  I hate it.  We went bowling last weekend.  Next weekend we're going to the zoo. Whoever said there was life after politics was full of shit.

Uh, wait ...

You're doing the right thing, Dick ... don't let 'em shake you.

... Somebody should shoot the little bastard.

Where you from?

That's Julie ... and that's Tricia. She, uh, reminds me a little bit of you ...

We didn't come here to talk about football.  We came here to end the war.

No, we don't!  You're full of shit! You say you want to end the war, so why don't you?  My brother died over there last November.  Why?  What good was his death?

You know, Fred, they sell tickets.

And this?!  Good Lord, have you lost your mind?  Nixon can't say this. "Niggers"!

Or we could write "expletive deleted."

It is.  We know that.  And it's enough that we know.  Just think of the girls.  They're still young.  We never see them.  I lost my parents.  I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...

I sure am.  The goddamned missile crisis united the whole country behind Kennedy.  And he was supporting Brown. People were scared, that's why.

Amen to that.

It would ruin us, Buddy, our family.

We can be happy.  We really can.  We love you, Dick.  The girls and I...

It was our dream, too, Buddy, together ... always.

Hi, Buddy.  What are you doing in here?

Because ... I have to relax.

Yeah, sure, a long time ago.

Penny for your thoughts.

Tomorrow.

And what would I find out that I haven't known for years.  What makes it so damn sad is that you couldn't confide in any of us. You had to make a record ... for the whole world.

How'd you know I was here.

But -- how'd you know it was mine?

That man that shot you died in prison.

What would you a done if he'd been released?

...Your granddad never asked me to sign on as deputy. I done that my own self. Loretta says you're quittin'.

You're discouraged.

I thought maybe she was with your boy there.

...I don't know what I do feel like.

Not word one.

...Somebody unloaded on this thing with a shotgun.

Probably must be.

...Now that's aggravating.

You gonna drive out there?

I'll call Loretta when I get there. I'd call now but she'll want me to come home and I just might.

Don't hurt no one.

Ed Tom, I'll be polite.

I got it Mama.

I put it in, Mama.

You gave your word?

That don't make sense. You gave your word to my husband to kill me?

I knowed you was crazy when I saw you settin' there. I knowed exactly what was in store for me.

Did you buy that gun?

What'd you give for that thing?

I need to know that.

Fine. I don't wanna know. I don't even wanna know where you been all day.

Not we, you. Stay with your mother.

Why all the way to Del Rio?

You can't afford one?

Promise?

She is just gonna cuss you up'n down.

I'm used to lots of things, I work at Wal-Mart.

Llewelyn?

I don't know, I had the sheriff here from Terrell County --

What's that.

Did you go up to his trailer?

Hello?

...Where's the transponder?

What airport would you use.

...You need to talk to me.

I think that you do. Do you know where I'm going?

You're in the hospital across the river. But that's not where I'm going. Do you know where I'm going?

He gave Acosta's people a receiver.

Yessir.

...I'd say around nine-thirty. Somewhere around nine-thirty.

Well... I need to close now --

We lived in Temple Texas for many years. Raised a family there. In Temple. We come out here about four years ago.

Yes you did. You been putting it up your whole life. You just didn't know it. You know what date is on this coin?

Well you give me the model number of the tent I can order you the poles.

Well I guess that'd be our ten-foot backyard Per-Gola. You can stand up in it. Well, some people could stand up in it. Six foot clearance at the ridge. You might just could.

One room, one night.

It's all right.

...I'm wondering...

You tell me the option.

Waitin' for my wife.

It's called a transponder.

Not that way.

...What do you do?

Pot metal?

...I'm across the river. At the Hotel Eagle. Carson Wells.  Call me when you've had enough. I can even let you keep a little of the money.

No no. No. You don't understand. You can't make a deal with him. Even if you gave him the money he'd still kill you. He's a peculiar man. You could even say that he has principles. Principles that transcend money or drugs or anything like that. He's not like you. He's not even like me.

I ask questions. If I get sensible answers then they get to go to America. If I don't get sensible answers they don't. Is there anything about that that you don't understand?

Are you in the service?

What outfit.

Could I have that in American?

You're lying!

What the hell do you want?... Hey, Sue Ann, what's up?

Yeah? Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday from Arizona.

Come on, Elden, think about it. The driver, all them trunks standing open like that... something's going on here!

Oww... Did you have to make these things so tight?

Just shut up a second and listen... That, uh... that bar in Arizona? Where you said Betty was?

That's a lie! I figured it out! I've been trying to tell this dumbass --

...I never meet people like you. I'm a garbageman of the human condition. I deal with trash, mostly, people willing to trade any part of themselves for a few more minutes of their rotten lives. But you... you're different.

Wait. Let me get this out.  I like the symphony, walks in the rain, sunsets, animals and children. I read passionately, and I like to discuss things. I'm basically conservative, but flexible. I've been involved in the death of thirty- two people, but I can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty- two pieces of shit, excuse my language.

I thought you were a garbageman of humanity, or something.

Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.

Of course, I don't know every doctor who works here...

Yep. Hey, I got a surprise for tonight. We're going to the Starlite in style!

The LeSabre!

All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?

Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy.  Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?

...of course you do.  You don't remember me?

I beg your pardon?

That's very kind of you.

Oh, you mean Fred.

For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year.

Of course.

You never mentioned a 'Stella' to me.

No, I mean your dedication scares me...

Why are you doing this to me?

Well, I don't know what you had in mind, but I hope you're happy. I put myself on the line for you, my reputation, and you're making me look like an idiot.

I'm sorry... Oh my gosh, are you George McCord?!

But I'm David... I mean, I'm not David, but she thinks I am! You heard her...  Stop staring at me... I'm not crazy, she is!

Hey, the FDA screwed me on that when they changed the law, and you know it!  Anyway, 'least I try shit, still got some dreams left... you're a goddamn waitress, what do you got?

Well, are you gonna answer me? What'd you come here for?

Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to keep it wrapped for a few...

What're you doing here, Roy?

Yes.

What's the matter here?

Shut up, Merle... Williams.

I'm getting back with my ex-fianc. He proposed to me right around here, so I guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop...

No. Loma Vista.

Worse.

Ellen, this is the biggest thing I've ever done, but I've gotta do it.

I can't believe I remembered that, although I suppose I should. I wrote it...  But that was seven years ago, and you're quoting it verbatim. I'm flattered... I think. Or frightened. What's your name?

You don't sound like you're from here.

So why'd you come to L.A.?

It's something I had to do. For David.

I got this apartment with a guy.

You made it! Hey, that looks great on you. 'S classy...  So, how'd it go today? You find him?

I know what you mean, I recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie.  His wife.

Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.

Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!

Doctor David Ravell.

I spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. I should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but I was with you.

I'm not going back on our arrangement. My word is good, and my family owes you. But I think it's best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can.

Does he know you think he's real?

This isn't fair, you know. Do you always get what you want?

What are you doing?

That won't be necessary. She's staying with a Rosa something... Hernandez, Herrera. I know it's an 'H' sound... in Silverlake.

What part of Dixie are you from, Duane?

Here's Ghengis Kunt and The Demilitarized Zone. Get it?  They're Korean, so they're pretty hot.

If you ate at the Tip Top you did.

It's a nice place you got here. Real comfortable. Sweet little town, Fair Oaks. You like it here?

I didn't think so. So, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. Not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it.

All right... lemme see... okay, new Burger King opens up. These assholes get excited and start lining up. Like it's some five star restaurant. The place is mobbed. Right?

Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?

Oh, Jesus, please... Please, God.

Hey... you got a fine one right here!

Now, that's really stupid.

Hold still, Del, we're just talking here...  Then you grab a big handful of hair and pull as you cut. It's amazing how easily the scalp comes off.

Are you out of your mind? You scalped him!

That one look you got! I thought you were done, so I took him out...

Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy, just good. They get in, they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom, boom, boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead.

He's telling the truth. He doesn't know.

They said find it. Find her, find it. Finish the job you were paid to do.

What?

How'd they describe her?

What difference does it make? She wasn't in Kansas City, or Houston, or Dallas. We went to every goddamn place Del mentioned and no Betty. So what the hell makes you think she's in Vegas? You think she's waiting for us with tassles on her titties? Vegas is too crass for Betty.

"When I grow up I'm going to become a nurse or a veterinarian. I always want to help people and value all life, be it animal, plant or mineral..."  Does that sound like a goddamn showgirl to you?

So you believed the bartender. Why?

No, no, Betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So, first thing we...

What doesn't?

What in the...  What the hell is this? You've been holding out on me. All this fucking time!

Fuck the profile! That's the same guy!!

I don't like talking bad about the dead, but now that he's gone I can tell you she put up with things in that marriage I wouldn't have. And yes, she, of all people, was the one who defended him. And that's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry.

Really?

Right, uhh... I feel terrible about this, we have a prior engagement at another party.  But... I'd be honored if you'd come.

Can I have an evil twin?

It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here!

Jesus, don't do that! If it gets around that you fired me, I'll never land a pilot.

Yeah? The sport utility?

Hey, can you sneak me on the lot?

You've got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone. That's not our Betty...

No... before that.

What did you say?

So tell her to settle for the old one in Orange County.

Her show?

I see.  Did Chloe testify?

Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell.

We ain't gonna make it walkin'.

Why don't we bed down out here tonight?

NOW HOLD ON, BOYS-AINTCHA EVER HEARD OF A NEGOTIATION? MAYBE WE CAN TALK THIS THING OUT!

Five... hunnert... thousand... each.

Damn! We gotta skedaddle!

Yeah, look at me.

...I'm not sure that's Pete.

Huh. I guess they'll tack on fifty years for me too.

I guess Vernon T. Waldrip is gonna be goin' on relief. Maybe I'll be able to throw a little patronage his way, get the man a job diggin' ditches or rounding up stray dogs.

I'm just makin' a point, you stupid sonofabitch!

I'm sayin' we har this man away.

Suckin' away.

No, I believe he's a-gonna paddle it.

That ain't your daddy, Alvinelle. Your daddy was hit by a train.

Aw, honey, our ring is just a old pewter thing -

I said I thought it was in the rolltop desk.

A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.

Huh?! They dam that river on the 21st.  Today's the 17th!

How's this a plan? How're we gonna get a car?

Hell, at least it woulda washed away the stink of that pomade.

An' all my meals for free...

...No treasure... I had two weeks left on my sentence...

Pete... I do apologize.

Well, it's a invitation-only affair; we'll have to sneak in through the service entrance-

Now what can I do you for, Mister French?

Soggy Bottom Boys - I don't precisely recollect, uh -

Oh I remember 'em, colored fellas I believe, swell bunch a boys, sung into yon can and skedaddled.

It was a powerful air.

Languishing! Goddamn campaign is languishing! We need a shot inna arm!  Hear me, boys? Inna goddamn ARM!  Election held tomorra, that sonofabitch Stokes would win it in a walk!

That's a maiden name.

Okay, okay. You win.

Hi, Byron.

Great ass.

Zack, we've got to go.

When did this happen?

He doesn't mean anything by it, Zack. Do you, Joe?

Where'd you get this, Mayo? This is really wonder work.

I want your D.O.R.

She may not make it through the program, but she's got more heart and more character than you'll ever have. I've seen your college record. I've never heard of most of those schools. Tell me something, Mayo. Did you buy that degree?

I want to fly, sir!

Mayo, are those your friends?

I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait.

Congratulations, Ensign Mayo, sir!

See you in the fleet, sir!

What did you call me, boy?

No, sir!

Vietnam?

What would you girls like to do? Want to stick around here for a little or... or could I suggest another plan...?

If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel.

How late?

But... but what would we do? Where would we go?

See you in a month when you get liberty!

Well, it you're not gonna ask, then I will. How was it?

Details, Pokrif. From what I saw he had an incredible body.

He ask you out for next weekend?

You serious about having him over?

Paula, how far would you go to catch Zack?

Lynette, where's Sid?

God help you, Lynette!

And you turned him down??

Hey, what kind of name is Pokrifki?

You got a girl?

I hear most of the girls who come to these things are looking for a husband.

Do you go to school?

I forgot to thank you for breakfast.

Come on. Invite me. All day the idea of a family Sunday dinner's been coming into my head. Since you're the only one I know around here with family...

Hi.

Some day. When I'm sure I can do a better job of it than my folks.

Please stop it. None of that's true. Goddamnit, I love you. I loved you ever since I met you.

However you got it figured, I didn't kill Sid and Lynette didn't kill him! He killed himself!

You'd make it. He's just getting to the girls. Come on, Zack. I gotta see my family, man. I couldn't take it if he keeps me here over the weekend.

How about that prick! He told me he wasn't officer material because he grew up poor like me.

Think there's any truth to what he was saying about those girls? Is that still going on?

Hey, you gonna tell anybody about this?

Look at Foley! Can you believe it!

That isn't true, is it?

What? You've gotta be kidding!

Talk to me in the morning. I feel like shit.

He's right, Zack. It doesn't matter.

Please, Zack -- go back to the barracks!

What the fuck is funny about this?

So what the fuck are we supposed to do?!

He said open it.

Stop it!  Stop it!

You can.  You're full of ideas.  You just need to squeeze one out.

One.  Squeeze.

You got an idea?

Yeah, just like a half hour, maybe a little more, and your mom'll give it to you.  You can wait a half hour, can't you?

Let me fucking finish this so we can get out of here.

WHO THE FUCK BREAKS IN THROUGH THE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE?!

Fuck!

Fourteen day escrow, man, that's almost three weeks!  They shouldn't be here for another week!  They don't own this house yet!

What tables?  I've never seen him before.

I don't have to tell you there is an acute shortage of living space in Manhattan right now and this is a highly unique property.

Third floor, spare bedroom, den, what have you.  Mr. Pearlstine used it as an office.

Everything's spring-loaded, even if the power's out it's fully functional.

Push that button for me, will you?

Ever read any Poe?

Old Bernie didn't miss a trick with this room, did he?

Can't hear a thing.

I heard you.

Yeah.

Nope.

Fuck.

If it looks like I can't get back, just close the door.

What?

Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.

Uhh... I with it sister but...

I'm okay... listen to me...  Let's go with Judge, check it out.

No...

This brothers is gonna be a colossal event. We'll shut the mother down right at the capitol, in front of the cameras.  Will you cool it? What's up man? What it be Bobby?

What? We're the leadership, you and me. There ain't enough of us to...

Huey!! Man you gotta check this out... You're gonna love...

What the fuck?

You're Judge right? We need to talk.

I expect to hear from you soon. If Huey Newton takes a crap, I want to know how big it was. Otherwise I'm gonna come looking for you. And I won't be as "friendly" as today.

Get out of the car.

Inspector Brimmer

Yeah... I'm fucked up. You're fucked up. Government's fucked up. Whole country's fucked up. You got no idea what's going on here. This is bigger than you and me. We're just little tiny soldiers getting moved around on some big asshole's desk. The Panthers... fuck you're history... they killed you and you don't even know it.

Motherfucker... you stay away...

PE? What? You guys doing gym class?

Cy... Cy... Oh shit man... who did this to you. Was it the pigs?

Don't I know it. Come on in Agent Rodgers. Sit down. Always a... pleasure to see you. How can I be of help?

Of course. Well, I appreciate your offer, but we got things pretty well under control. Same bunch of kooks you guys already have under surveillance. They're still doing a lot of yelling and pot-smoking but nothing to worry about.

I want it duly noted, that this operation was entirely under the auspices of the Oakland Police Department. The FBI doesn't have a monopoly on agents infiltrating enemy organizations, my friend. As I've said before, Agent Rodgers, we have things under control in our city...

This here's a "Panther Patrol." We see a brother getting busted. We check it out, make sure the pig don't go beating on the man. Brother gets taken downtown, we post bail, hook 'em up with a lawyer.

Yeah man, but where's Judge?

We put our lives on the line today. Malcolm X's widow was on the line today. And your guns weren't even loaded.

Welcome brother, have you decided to get down with us?

You know, you're lucky to be back. Most niggers die on the front lines. Seems like that's what they're there for.

Whatever you need, I'll be there.

Man, this shit's pretty thick.

I saw... but...

I thought you said all the Panthers were gonna be here.

You're a smart brother... you should dig what Huey and Bobby got to say...

Busted firing pin.  You want only the legal stuff right?

Fuck is up?!

You better just kill me Tyrone. And when Huey gets out, when Oakland's just wall to wall junkies, you tell him you blew away the only chance we all got. I'm sure he'll be real happy about that.

Motherfuckers...

My Mom's at that.

It was Sabu killed Cy.

God damn it's him. I gotta go.

It's okay Mom. I'm allright.

Yeah... cop hit me...

I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning.

You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia?

I know him well enough?

What unit?

We did.

Shall we proceed?

I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.

Colonel, imagine the utter chaos that would result from un-led armies having at each other.  There must be gentlemen in command to lead and, when appropriate, restrain their men.

Very well, let us move on to...

I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war.

It seems our Swamp Fox wants to have a formal parley.

Is that why the Assembly was convened?

I have to get these dispatches to Hillsboro.

What now, sir?

How old are you?

These four wagons must be his.

Fourteen dead, eleven wounded, eighteen captured.

Stay the course... your mother used to say that to me when I'd get drunk or lose my temper.

She said... she loves you and misses you but she understands why you can't be there with her.

Don't go in there.

We buried them, then we went to track.  It was a cold trail and they were moving fast.  We went faster. We caught up to them at Kentucky Ford.

You don't hate him.

An American nation.  Colonel Lee, with your permission?

Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists.  It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested.  We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.

We don't have to go to war to gain independence...

Wars are not fought only by childless men.  A man must weigh his personal responsibilities against his principles.

Green Dragoons came to my home, killed my son, Thomas.  It was Tarleton himself.

And Patriots will start dying on the gallows instead of the battlefield.  Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the South until the French arrive.  A treaty was signed at Versailles after our victory at Saratoga.  The French are sending a fleet and ten thousand troops.

The bigger problem is where, not when.  The French fleet won't sail north of the Chesapeake for fear of early storms.

They'd be better off, but the cause wouldn't be.

Your son, what did you name him?

You may, of course, keep your weapons, but I must warn you that...

Yes, quite, but you should know that...

Reverend.

How many came back?

Father, you can't let them take him...

Father... I killed those men...

What if you can't read what's written on there anymore?

They do it to honor the dead, Ellen.

Honey, Church will be fine.

Please hurry.

No-I guess not.

I want to look around, daddy-- may I?

That's what I think. I heard Missy Dandridge tell Mom when Church was fixed he wouldn't cross the road so much.

In the end he's gonna croak, isn't he?

Good God! Where'd you hear that?

At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell.

But don't you dare say that.

I don't get it.

I'm not tired!

What?

You folks ready to go on?

Not yet...how much further is it?

No--not right out loud. Their stones speak...or their markers. Even if the marker ain't nothing but a tin can someone wrote on with a Magic Marker, it speaks. Ain't that so, Louis?

Did you tell me Rachel took the kids back to Chicago for a few days?

Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's.

No, you shouldn't have stopped. But you got away with it. Important thing is are you sure you're all right?

It's funny, all right.

This was their burying ground, Louis.

The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat.

Doesn't look like they last long.

Well, she was a little upset at first, and that's why I thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night...you did, didn't you, Louis?

Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?

---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---

I'm sorry I couldn't go with you to Missy's funeral. And that I blew up when we went to that silly animal graveyard.

How does he do that?

AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!

What -- you don't have the medallion?

No, I really think I do.

There's ... another exit?

So what now, Jack Sparrow?  Are we to be two immortals, locked in epic battle until the trumpets of Judgement Day?

Looks like your back to having nothing to offer.

That's proper, sir, according to the code.

I'll drop it!

Agreed.  You have my word, as a gentleman of fortune --

I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.

Man overboard!

Did he speak?

You're speaking up for him again?

No.  The pirates have taken Will --

You'll be dining with the Captain, and he requests you wear this.

I can't believe he would make such a sacrifice for us.

There.  And don't you dare tell me that wasn't a proper kiss!

You are despicable.

You're in league with Barbossa!

Has it changed since the last time you were here?

You should look at our contretemps this way: we've got shade trees, thank the Lord.  We've got some food on the trees, thank the Lord again.  And we've got rum, praise the Lord.  We can stay alive a month, maybe more.  Keep a weather eye open for passing ships, and our chances are fair.

Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...

When I get the Black Pearl back, I'm going to teach it to the whole crew, and we'll sing it all the time!

That signal is over a thousand feet high, which means it can be seen for two hundred leagues in every direction.  The entire Royal Navy is out to sea looking for me -- do you think there is even a chance they could miss it?

These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed.

Curse you for breathing, you slack- jawed idiot.  Mother's love, Jack, you know better than to wake a man when he's sleeping.  It's bad luck!

Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack. Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx.

Blast it, I'm already awake!

I'll tell lee.  Now, Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him, and that's where the whole problem starts.  This was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl --

Raise the sails.

Sir!  Shall I break out the cannons?

This dock is off-limits to civilians.

You would do that?

You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?

Who makes all these?

You cheated.

Where does it make berth?

Why are brothering with that?

We're going to steal a ship?  That ship?

I knew him.  Probably one of the few he knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill.

Good man.  Good pirate.  And clever -- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin.

I swear, you look just like him.

Sure -- because he could always go pirating.

Put it away, Will.  It's not worth getting beat again.

Tortuga?

On what?

That Jack Sparrow ... he talked about the Black Pearl.

Captain Norrington... I appreciate your fervor, but I am concerned about the effect this subject will have on my daughter.

Has my daughter given you an answer yet?

Commodore --

Dr. Bright, I don't have to do anything.

You can't mean that.

Something to drink, Dr. Bright?

This is our world, Susan, and once you realize that, you will understand that the only place our path can end is on the throne of heaven.  Science is the quest for divine perfection.

What did you use?

... plastic.

She's working as fast as she can, Icarus.  It will be ready soon.

She says it's not.

It works, Poppy.  It works, it works!

Poppy, are you in one of your moods again?

Can you feel it, Poppy?  The presence of the moment?  Can you feel the weight of its significance?

Okay.  Alright.  Okey-dokey.  Now, we need the nanobot.  The nanobot that initiated the reaction.  Once we have that we can stabilize the meltdown.  Simple really.  No problem.

Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control.

Excellent work, Dr. Nebbleman.  You have outdone yourself.

Haw-haw!  Why don't you run off and find a cop and I'll wait right here.

Oh no, no, no.  No can do.  You enjoyed a tasty beverage and thus this receptacle becomes your responsibility and I don't care if it's a Styrofoam cup or the Exxon Valdez!  You've got to learn to take responsibility!

Do you remember about five years ago, that uh... incident at Purnell Labs?

What did security say?

Well, you got another problem.

Yes?

You want to tell me what I'm looking for?

Like Crazy Glue?

Really?  What have you been doing?

I've read they're using it to repair cancer cells.

Yeah.

We'll see?  What does that mean?

Daniel, give him the Trix.

Oh no, no, no!  You've got to be able to fix me!  Please, Susan, tell me you can make me normal again!

We don't have time for hysterics.

The nanobot combined your molecules with the plastic molecules in the white assembler fluid, so that on a molecular level you now have more in common with a Good Year tire than a human being.

Look at this!

You're not protecting the world, you're obstructing progress!

And I'm sure you thought Columbus was going to sail off the edge of the world!

No cheese.

Run, Daniel!  Get out of here!

Susie... I...

What would happen if I threw him into the core?

This is wonderfully accommodating of you all.  Now I won't have to come looking for you.

Mrs. Argon?  It's Sim.

Oh yeah, he's alive.  Technically.

Under the circumstances, I can't fathom what makes Dr. Argon think we are ready for anything bigger.  If C.N.N., or hell, if the E.P.A. knew what was in my basement --

Icky!

If this nutcase did take it and has half a brain, he'd use it right away, before we could invalidate it.

What in the hell?

Miss Wilson will give you the guest list and any other details you may need, Miss Gallagher.

You know something, lady, if you sold life insurance, I'd go for a policy in sixty seconds.

May I use your telephone?

That's considerate of you.

Just listen to this  Adorable Babykins Does her miss her Baby? Him sends his booful li'l sweetums a billion oceans full of kisses. Bobo is so lonely!

Oh, I don't need another guess. It's quite obvious.

Will you step into the library?

Now Mother, your attitude is perfectly ridiculous. It's done now. Stewart and I are married.

Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house

We could have the whole left wing? Wouldn't that be nice! Would that be room enough for us?

Look Anne, you're not serious about this, are you?

I know that.

Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll wear garters and you'll like it too!

No? What do you look upon her as?

Go downstairs, and tell them - anything. Tell them I'm not going. Tell them I'm not home.

I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves

Oh hello, Anne He types furiously.

Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable?

This is something I should have done a long time ago, only I didn't have sense enough to do it. No, I had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that I knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning. But no more. No more! So that's that.

That's an excellent idea.

I want to see Stew Smith. Oh excuse me - I mean Mr. Smith.

a beautiful pair of shoulders! But listen now, as a favor, will you please make it snappy, Laughing Waters,[14] and tell Stew Smith I gotta see him because if you don't my whole family's going to die.

Fine. Have a seat.

Oh, that's all right with me. I won't hold it against you. But you see, I'm here to find out about

Thank you very much.

Impossible. Put it on again.

What do you want?

Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy?

Do you know what to do in a drawing- room?

Now listen, we've got a tip that the Schuyler family has finally made a deal with that chorus dame.

Yeah, little Gloria.

I've heard of people being scooped on their own funerals, but this! Holy mackerel! Why, it's news when Anne Schuyler gets her fingernails manicured, but this! She gets married to one of our own reporters and the Tribune beat us to it!  Well! What do you guys want? Go on, get back to your desks. Go back to your work.  Now don't tell me you were drunk at the time and don't remember! Or is this one of Bingy's snow-storms?

Mr. Schuyler .

And live on your salary, I suppose?

No?

How do you like your bath, sir?

Who are you?

You're my what?

Say, you are nice. You're all right. You'd make a good wife.

I think I understand, sir. You mean you want me to go?

Sure, sure. You've got a nose, Gallagher. You've got a nose. But there's different women, Gallagher. You know, like brewery horses and thoroughbreds.

Don't pay attention to him, Stew. He doesn't know what he's talking about.

Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph.

You know what I should do with you? I should sock you right in that funny little nose.

Did who?

Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.

Hey, Gallagher!

What other girl?

Traps shut!

She wants me to arrange the financial settlement.

Remember what I told you about that twentieth crack? All right, you've just made it. Before you go unconscious I want you to get this through your nut.

We just thought that

Come in, Joe. It's all right.

Indeed? Perhaps he will do me a great favor.

Stop calling me Mother!

Good morning, everybody  Well, maybe it isn't a good morning, huh?  Anne, did you ever get the feeling that there was someone else in the room with you?

Did you call, sir?

Shhh! Do you hear something?

You try it.

Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?

That's puttering, sir.

I just love you in that sweater Mary-Sue. It's so flattering.

What goes on up at Lover's Lane?

You sure you want to know this?

Why no. She's still on her date with Biff ... is something the matter?

It's okay. It's alright.

Does it look okay?

Thank you.

It's alright. Let me see.

It goes away ... It'll go away.

I made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ...  I'm gonna go now.

I sure am glad you said you'd come out with me tonight Mary Sue.

I don't know if I ever said this to you before, but, well ... I think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school ...

I mean, there's kids that are even holding hands already but I figure there's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on. Don't you?

... Why?

Mary Sue--C'mon ...

Oh.  I can't.

I'm busy.

Oh God! Are we in that episode?

What'll it be?

Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...

Oh my gosh. What's he gonna to do?

No. They do. And it isn't just 'cause you're a great bowler ... They respect you ...

And it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right. If you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it.

Do you know that it's illegal?

YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER!

And where's that?

What's outside of Pleasantville?

Mr. Simpson ...

Omigod, I don't be-lieeeeve this! He's gonna like beeeee here!

Oh my God ...  Oh my God ...

Lemme see that.

What did you do?

Oh God.

I'm gonna hurl, David. I swear to God.

Play along?

No way.

JENNIFER!

I've worn some kinky stuff before ...

What do you mean?

He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...

What did you do to him?

Not directly anyhow ...

Um ... They like wanna ask you a question ... I didn't know how to handle it. So ...

Can I ask you a question?

How come I'm still in black and white?

Besides. You think there's like a chance I'm gonna get into college back there?

No. I baked them for you.

Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know.

I picked them myself. They grow wild up here.  Mmm. So sweet.

Real rain?

Where are they?

Okay, whose window did Bud break when he was playing with his father's golf clubs?

You're unbelievable. You'll win this thing for sure. When is it on?

Holy cow. Look at that. Had a little disaster didn't ya fella.

... Like Prince Charming.

So even though I can't make any promises, well--I figured if you asked me real nice--I might just be willing to talk about it again.

I'll be honest with you Bud. I'm getting sorta concerned about what I'm seeing in some of these re-runs ...

BUD.

OW!

Now Buddy, you're going on trial tomorrow. And if they find you guilty, you're gonna be stuck here forever. Well, not forever--lemme think ...  Five year sentence ... Carry the three ... That comes out to ... sixteen and a half centuries, and that's rounding down.

What's wrong?

Yeah ...

There aren't any cheeseburgers.

Oh hi!

Well ... I'm not sure I see the point anymore.

Look, you can't always like what you do. Sometimes you just do it because it's your job. And even if you don't like it, you just gotta do it anyway.

Oh, well--you're just starting out. I mean, you can't do it ...

Well how do you know it won't go back to the way it was?

Dream come true, hunh?

Hey.

So uh ... Maybe we could uh ...

I'm just working....I have some customers here.....

What city?

Yes, indeed, yes I am.

Please don't.

You're lucky. She couldn't come anyway --

Are you gonna do it?

I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I do this just to rag you?

Hey. What are you doing?

Oh My God, yeah, I know exactly where she is, why?

No she didn't; that's a lie.

Tell me why.

Nothing.

No.

Really?

It doesn't matter.

...yeah....well you have me now.

Hello?

Hi....what....what's up....?

Uh-huh.

Yes.

Me?

Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry.

This makes me very uncomfortable.

Are you telling me no?

Hi.

I'm sorry I couldn't come to your sister's birthday party last night, Elizabeth had invited me and I couldn't make it --

What do you do with all this pudding?

That's great -- Hawaii. I was thinking about going there.

I was, yeah, I was thinking about going there for business --

-- I'm probably not gonna go though.

It was great to meet you again. To see you again, thanks for helping me yesterday --

Do you want to pick me up?

This is funny.

Who is it?

How long have you known her?

So that pudding was bought, I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....

-- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?

That's what's used to redeem the mileage, so in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code -- in other words: Two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add in the coupon: it's one thousand. You see?

....yeah....

What did he want?

There's a better place for us to eat.

Are you learning how to play it?

Hi.

Have a good trip.

Yeah?

Well let's do something do you want to do something, can you meet me?

Oh my god, you are so adorable. I just....god dammit.

How many times have you been on an airplane?

Yeah.

Yes I'm sorry.

....I'm not exactly sure what that means...

Did you have my home phone number?

Why?

I didn't do that.

Alright, well you're gonna have to leave. You're gonna have to go.

Can I pay you here? Can I pay you for our drinks and salad?

Hi, is this your first time calling?

Of course. Would you like to talk to a girl? I can connect you with a beautiful girl if I can just get your credit card number followed by the expiration date?

No one will know your name.

You want her to call you Jack?

It's a call back service -- a girl will call you back.

You do guaranteed sale? etc.

Yes.....we do ask for....30 to 60 days....

Sorry about that.

It's alright.

No, no, no, no, no. What do you mean? It doesn't state anywhere about six to eight weeks.

How am I supposed to know what to do if you don't say it -- if it's not in your rules and regulations in your fine print how am I supposed to know how to be with this --

You ok?

You talkin' to me about Ramada Inn?

What happened?

Ok. Well. I'm gonna go out of town. I'm going to go out of town just for two days...

Seven o'clock.

I know.

This is this place called Ace Vintage, you gotta find it, I don't know exactly where this is and I don't understand these maps so just go there and check it out. It's a '61 AC Cobra that this old guy says is fine, but I need to figure out why he's only asking 23 for it. So take a look, the whole thing, call me about that, if it seems alright then I'll head down there and check it out.

That's it.

So they'll go.

Hello?

Put him through.

So...did my brother call you?

I think he's weird, but that's me.

"And so the Professor lifted Colombe's skirt high, above her waist. 'Let me be your Tutor,' said he, 'in the ways of love.' With that, he slid her pantalettes down, down, down over her knees, and there -- nestled between her legs -- as pink as a tulip, as slick as an eel --"

"To seal the wound, he took a poker from the fire --"

I was wrong to free him, but so are you -- for taking all his treasures -- his quills and his ink --

Had I known your taste in novels, I never would've taught you to read.

In part, yes.

The Doctor's a respected man, a friend of the court --

And --?

It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.

It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?

Fuck 'em! They're half-wits and pinheads. Let 'em die on the streets, as Nature intended.

Madeleine. She's besotted with me; she'd do anything I ask. She could pay you a midnight visit --

That's a Turkish weave, you numbskull; it costs more than you'll earn in your lifetime --

-- water! --

Don't confuse one organ with another --

Go to hell!

I dare you. Stab my flesh. Which one of us will bleed?

Abbe de Coulmier!

He's made a great success of our Little Theater; there's seldom an empty seat. Not to mention its therapeutic value.

Why is he in your care, and not a proper prison?

Oh. That.

It's essential to his recovery; a purgative for the toxins in his mind.

Well?

It was fiction, of course.

You'll get more from her with kindness than you will with force.

This child let loose the beast from its cage --

As for the author... shoot him.

Charenton? The administrator there is quite well-loved, is he not?

I'll be waiting.

At last she arrives, my hard-won bride! Hurry, my child, and scurry inside. There you'll find such treasures await you; Marzipan and meringue to sate you!

I'm hungry for a proper visit.

You've already stolen my heart, as well as another more prominent organ, south of the Equator...

The unhappy tale of a virginal laundry lass, the darling of the lower wards, where they entomb the criminally insane.

It's a long story, this one.

The story's thrilling conclusion comes at a premium.

Surely you've seen a man naked.

I must say, in your novels you stoke the most unrealistic expectations.

It needn't be; not if you've another story.

Tomorrow night, whisper a new tale to your neighbor, Cleante. He'll whisper it to his neighbor Dauphin, who'll whisper it to his neighbor Franval --

-- whose cell lies next to the linen cabinet! There, armed with a quill of my own, I'll commit it to paper!

A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!

"By the time you read this, we'll be long gone; bound for England or points beyond..."

You'd do that, rather than forsake our love?

It is customary to write first, and request an appointment --

I assume you've come to plead for clemency on your husband's behalf.

I am eternally in your debt.

Doctor... Can I impart to you his cruelest trick?

You've no right to assault me in this fashion; I'll call for my footman. I'll have you removed --

Hm? Tell me. What other treats?

I beg you, Donatien... as your wife... your only ally... you must stop making such a monstrous spectacle of yourself.

Listen, you come down and stay with us for a few days. Just tell the old man that--

Quite. And this is why I came to visit. Have you heard about this CITIZEN KANE picture?

The Journal was pretty harsh to Roosevelt today.

It's not really--

We're 125 million dollars in debt?

I'm not asking you to defend anything. But we're in a pickle and we gotta talk about it.

You don't have any money left, okay?! That's the truth. I don't wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it's the truth. You spent it all. You can't buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it--

I know where Deauville is for C-C-Christ's sake.

There's a different between want and

You are repellant when you drink.

Thank you for your time

You're not going to get another chance, boy! Look right at the monster and you tell him--

love them so much that they ought to love you back. Only you want love on your own terms. "

Now, Orson, you know I'm just dyin' to see your picture and I know it's gonna be boffo, but you're writing about a publisher, right?

How about Howard Hughes? We could do Hughes

Manolete?!

The great Spanish bullfighter

You may think you know what you're talking about, kid, but believe me, you don't. You're talking about going into a battle you can never win on a battlefield so far above things like movies and Hollywood that Hearst won't even have to glance down when he crushes you. When he flicks you away with one finger. I'm talking about money and influence and evil beyond your capacity to imagine Hell.

Sorry to disappoint.

Why her?

Hearst looks down at the world at his feet Everything has always been beneath him.

It's 350 pages long.

It's good, huh?

And I'm looking at them -- and they're all looking at me and I don't know who should pour the tea. '

I want you back

No, but I can imagine. What am I today? A "puny upstart" or a "spoiled dilettante" -- no, she wouldn't know how to spell that

This is just the first shot. Maestro. Sooner or later she's gonna use the word. And all those boys know that there is only one thing this country hates more than the coloreds and that's the Jews.

You know, all this nightmare we went through with Hearst. The whole thing... And in the end, probably no one will ever remember the picture anyway.

May I help you?

Not one of them today has what you had, Miss Davies. Not one of them.

You're going to destroy it

"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud."

Do WAR OF THE WORLDS as a feature and everyone's happy. You make some money and New York's happy and you have a track record and then we'll move on to KANE.

And this is the evening edition. Notice anything?

You wanna commit suicide, fine! You got some death- wish, fine! But you will not drag this company down with you!

You're not still mad at me, I hope

It's my birthday this week. I'll be 26.

Oh God. . .

How 'bout a real drink?

We're from...

Hey champ!

Believe what you want.

C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.

How do you know? You know her that good?

How you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... I don't know if she'll be there alone... She'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something.

Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.

Probably. You know she talks to everybody, and not just him.

They robbed us! Those fuckin' judges -- What the fuck fight were they watching? If I see them on the street, I'll break their heads. Decision Robinson, my fuckin' ass! Those judges give him the decision 'cause he's goin in the army next week! How else could this have happened?... What do you think they gave him the decision for, that's why.

You want us to wait for you?

Well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! Now I don't know if I can make it down to 155. I'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if I don't make 155, I forfeit $15,000! You're supposed to know what you're doin'. You're supposed to be a manager!

Nah, she would never...

Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.

Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.

I got good news, and I got bad news. The good news is you got your shot at the title. The bad news is...

What? I just said hello. Since when I can't kiss my sister-in-law?

Who did it have anything to do with... Vickie?

What?

I did keep an eye...

What do you mean, "you"?

But you said "you."

You're very smart, Joey, very smart. Nobody gives me a straight answer around here. You're givin' me these answers, but you still didn't answer my question. Did you fuck Vickie?

I'm pulling out of next Wednesday's TV bout 'cause I can't make the weight. I'm fighting at light heavyweight, and I still can't make the weight.

Joey said you wanted to meet me. Is that right? You wanted to meet me?

I can't find my ball.

Can you see it?

I like the gym smell.

You asleep?

Tell me, you think of anybody else when I'm making love to you?

Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro?

Hey, you don't say goodbye to him like that.

What was it about?

Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?

Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?

You know, if there's one thing -- I just don't understand you, not one single little bit. You love me?

I want to say something to you without you blowing your stack.

Why don't you just call him up?

I'm sorry. I had to work late last night. Slept at the club.

Sure, what else is new?

Open the door, Vickie.

Aw, c'mon. Don't say that.

The kids are sleeping.

What are you doing?

Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?

How's the weight? Ok?

Hey, leave the kids alone.

I can't convince him. He's got such a thick head, I'd like to crack it open myself. Believe me, my own brother. It's very hard. You don't have to convince me -- I know we should be with Tommy. You talk to him. He don't listen to nobody.

I said, let's go.

It don't look right.

I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want.

Does he have your number, Mr. Jefferies?

Bryce, the only man for this job is sitting right here in town.  Get me L. B. Jefferies.

Of course, it's normal for a man to tie his trunk up with a heavy rope.

I'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things. Murder is the least likely.

I think you saw something -- that probably has a very simple explanation.

She never left the apartment --

If possible -- both.

Jewelry?

That wasn't Mrs. Thorwald who left with him yesterday morning?

But I'm not a killer!

Oh -- that phone call!  I gave them your number -- hope you don't mind.

In sections! And one other thing, doubting Tom -- it just occurred to me that all the calls Thorwald made were long distance! If he called his wife the day she left -- after she arrived in Merritsville -- why did she need to send him a postcard saying she'd arrived?

Precinct Six. I sent a friend over with bail money.

Wrong day?

I'll send you some comic books.

Yeah? Maybe in the high rent districts they discuss -- but in my neighborhood, they still nag.

Hello.

I'm not shy. I've been looked at before.

Huh?

There's a dip at this end. And since when do flowers grow shorter in two weeks?

You shouldn't have let her do that! If he ever --

No.

Smart? She'll be arrested!

What do you need money for?

Yes.

Who's Thorwald?

Goodnight, you idiot.

And you love life?

Anything else bothering you?

That dress should be listed on the stock exchange.

Not a bit. I was all morning in a sales meeting. Then over to the Waldorf for a quick drink with Madame Dufresne -- just over from Paris. With some spy reports. Back to the "21" for lunch with the Harper's Bazaar people -- that's when I ordered dinner. Then two Fall showings -- twenty blocks apart. Then I had to have a cocktail with Leland and Slim Hayward -- we're trying to get his next show.  Then I had to dash back and change.

Make the one you want.

Well, she picked the most prosperous looking one.

If you're saying all this just because you don't want to tell me the truth, because you're hiding something from me, then maybe I can understand --

Those high heels would be a lot of use in the jungle -- and those nylons and six-ounce lingerie --

Huh? Try and find a raincoat in Brazil. Even when it isn't raining  Lisa, on this job you carry one suitcase. Your home is the available transportation. You sleep rarely, bathe even less, and sometime the food you even look at when they were alive!

You don't think either one of us could ever change?

And it's deflating to find out that the only way I can be part of it -- is to take out a subscription to your magazine. I guess I'm not the girl I thought I was.

Lisa, please!

There is -- I've seen things through that window! Bickering, family fights, mysterious trips at night, knives, saws, rope -- and since last evening, not a sight or sound of his wife! Now you tell me where she is and what she's doing!

I wonder where he's going now?

All day long I've tried to keep my mind on work.

And you, and you friend Doyle --  Did you hear from him again -- since he left?

A woman has a favorite handbag -- it always hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it. Then she takes a trip and leaves it behind. Why?

Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.

We have all -- what?

You said I'd have to live out of one suitcase  I'll bet yours isn't this small?

Surprise -- is the most important element of attack.  And beside, you're not up on your private eye literature. When they're in trouble, it's always their Girl Friday who gets them out of it.

I hate funny exit lines.

Do you suppose it's ethical to watch a man with binoculars, and a long- focus lens -- until you can see the freckles on the back of his neck, and almost read his mail -- do you suppose it's ethical even if you prove he didn't commit a crime?

Whatever happened to that old saying "Love Thy Neighbor."

I'll rephrase the question.

Do you think this was worth waiting all day to see?

Well?

Something's in there. Those flowers have been taken up, and put back again.

A man is assaulting a woman at one two five west ninth street. Second floor rear. Make it fast.

Buzzie--we better get out of here.

I thought only punks fought with knives.

Buzz Gundersen.

How'd he get in?

Any other entrance?

Suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous--where you have to prove something you need to know--a question of honor.  Would you do it?

Sure--there was a bad accident there.  They showed the pictures on T.V.

You'll learn as you get a little older, Jim.

I guess I cut pretty loose in my day too.

I guess when I nearly died giving birth to you--that shows how much I don't care!

No!

I'm just explaining what you mean! You can't be an idealist all your life!  Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!

Frank?  I'm frightened.

She keep it to protect herself, sir. She scared without a man in the house.

Do you know why you shot those puppies, John?  Is that what they call you or do you have a nickname?

Where did you get the gun?

He's a wheel.  So's she.  It's hard to make friends with them.

He has a knife.

Who has?

Come out come out wherever you are!

We're safe here.  I hope.  What do you think?

Haven't you noticed your personality splitting?

I'm not going to hurt you. PLATO Why did you run out on me?

You sure?

Can I keep it?

Why?

I'm sorry.

What happened, darling.  We were so worried.  I was going to take a sleeping pill, but I wouldn't till I knew you were home.

Do I have to spell it out?

Get lost.

You were getting a good start in the wrong direction back there. Why did you do it?

They never do.

Things pretty tough for you at home?

What a zoo!

Hi.  I saw you before.

You don't have to be unfriendly.

Where I saw you.  Everything going okay now?  You live around here?

I'll bet you're a real yo yo.

Goodbye!  See you!

It doesn't matter to them.

Well--we're newlyweds.

Of course.  Drown them like puppies.

Ever been in a place like this before?

Why?

You smell like baby powder.

No!

Judy--we're ready for you now.

Do you think your father means that?

Your mother will be down in a few minutes.

I was talking to Dad.

I guess I just don't understand anything.

Is this him!?

He'd rather die than be with you, he'd make a fucked-up boyfriend anyway.  Bury him all over the place.

Gabriel! You said talk to him. That's all you ever said...

He wants... your "sister"...

All those letters are about to pay off, baby... all those letters...

He's shown us the setup, he's drawn us the map, he's helped us do the plan. He wants a gun, give him a gun. Take the bullets out, whatever, but give him the gun. The more manpower we've got in there, the better. He won't try and make his move till the money's in hand.

We sell children's toys --

No --

No, c'mon --

Tell me something. This the first time you've ever done this?

Since Janey moved in... Gabriel... he's come over more and more. To the apartment. Janey's the divorced one, 'member, with the tit job --

He read the letters, Nick. Some day I wasn't there. He went through my room. He found your letters.

You motherfucker.

Nick died for me....

No!

We get to the bridge, we're all right!

We'll get there, baby... we'll get there...

You said they've run guns, in their trucks. So they'll have guns. To do this robbery. They'll have serious guns.

He says he wants it now.

Bullets or no bullets, he won't do it.

I don't know where you're going. But I'm going home.

You said Merry Christmas, Rudy.

You're a good writer, Nick. I give this writing an A-plus.

She's getting you to help us... 'cause she knows if you don't, you're dead. You just tell us what we need to know, you two live happily ever after. My sister loves you, motherfucker, and I ain't gonna have you break her heart.

Be more specific.

You knew the place --

What?

What the fuck are you talking about.

Y'know what, guys? I woke up this morning, I got a really lucky feeling going on. I mean it, I'm feeling that good. I wouldn't be surprised if I walk in there, pull a handle and hit jackpot. Hell, we wouldn't even have to --

A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for effort and an honorary degree. I'm surprised you never escaped from the Mountain.

He thought I was some gambler... he didn't know me... he didn't recognize me!

No.

I want a map of that security level. Every room, every guard, every thing.

You are lucky, convict. You're spending Christmas with the birthday boy himself --

Buncha guys in red suits busted in, they'll say. Started shooting. They won't be able to remember... if it was three, or four... or five. Four dead Santas and some burned-up cash. Merry Christmas, The End.

Get in the CAR!

Ash?

Who's robbin' who here, Gabriel...

The Powwow Safe?

Buffet. Whaddya think it is?

Having romance problems, Romeo?

What the hell was that about --

DROP 'EM! DROP, DROP, DROP!!!

You knew there were guns in here!

Monsters in the gelatin...

What's the first thing, man? What's the first thing you're gonna do?

Hell you haven't.

Three days, man.

Why you gotta. We were gonna give you a ride someplace, man. Now I just don't know.

All I want... is to make it to Sidnaw, and sit down for Christmas dinner. Watch some ball with my old man, sleep in my old bed, and have leftovers for bout six months.

Just taste that Christmas turkey.

So maybe after our week beneath the sheets, we'll head down to Motor City for New Year's. She says her roommate's skipping town for a few days, have the place to ourselves. Remember how her brother's a truck driver down there? I'm thinking he might be able to help get me some work.

GUARD! GUARD!

Oh, fuck, Rudy... oh Jesus...

Do what?

You're taking my money. Switch seats with me. Switch seats with me if you're not taking my money --

Start talkin

That's what it looks like!

I asked you a question. Are you clear about that?

How ya doin', Toothpick?

That I should've picked you up?

Eddie, if I was a pirate, I wouldn't throw you to the crew.

I don't know what he did to her, but she got even.

The motherfucker killed Vic.

I don't know, but somebody did.

Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.

Nice Guy. When we got to the bar...

A little.

Tell me more about Cabot.

...Her brother usually goes with her, but he's in county unexpectedly.

Jesus Christ!

Myself and Mr. Pink?

How is he?

I just want you to know, Joe, how much I appreciate your care packages on the inside.

Toby... who the fuck is Toby? Toby... Toby... think... think... think...

Wong?

Because you paid for the breakfast, I'm gonna tip. Normally I wouldn't.

Nobody's trading with anybody! Look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin' city counsel meeting! Listen up Mr. Pink. We got two ways here, my way or the highway. And you can go down either of 'em. So what's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?

Mr. Blue's dead?

You gonna put it away?

What for?

What's the cut, poppa?

Joe, I don't know what you think you know, but you're wrong.

He was the only one I wasn't a hundred percent on. I should have my fucking head examined for goin' forward when I wasn't a hundred percent. But he seemed like a good kid, and I was impatient and greedy and all the things that fuck you up.

Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.

So, talk.

What're you talkin' about?

Follow you where?

Why?

Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine. Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me please, are you a doctor?

Say-the-goddamn-words: You're gonna be okay!

I ain't going anywhere. I'm right here. I'm not gonna leave ya.

Look, I don't wanna be a fly in the ointment, but if help doesn't come soon, I gotta see a doctor. I don't give a fuck about jail, I just don't wanna die.

Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya? That sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho.

C'mon, throw in a buck.

Dead.

I'm cool.

Okay, let's go through what happened. We're in the place, everything's going fine. Then the alarm gets tripped. I turn around and all these cops are outside. You're right, it was like, bam! I blink my eyes are they're there. Everybody starts going apeshit. Then Mr. Blonde starts shootin' all the -

Look, enough of this "Mr White" shit -

You're right, this is bad.  How did you get out?

Tagged a couple of cops. Did you kill anybody?

Could you believe Mr. Blonde?

Did ya see what happened to anybody else?

So who's the rat this time? Mr. Blue? Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's Joe's show, he set this whole thing up. Maybe he set it up to set it up.

Without medical attention, this man won't live through the night. That bullet in his belly is my fault. Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me. And I'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die.

So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel? We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain.

Well, I guess we drop him off at the hospital. Since he don't know nothin' about us, I say it's his decision.

You didn't tell him your name, did ya?

Of course.

Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a fuckin' playground!  I don't believe this shit, both of you got ten years on me, and I'm the only one actin like a professional. You guys act like a bunch of fuckin' niggers. You ever work a job with a bunch of niggers? They're just like you two, always fightin', always sayin' they're gonna kill one another.

You should be. Maybe Lednov heard about that Sonora ranch of yours.

You don't know how good it is to see you.

Tell them to come on in.

What's the matter with her?

Yes, ma'am.

So am I.

Get back to the horses. They're straggling.

Learnin' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street.

Better go on back and get some more sleep. You'll need it later on.

No, I'm not all right. I'm soaked and I hit myself against that rock.

I can't --

Who's Lednov?

You might tell a fellow things, 'specially if the fellow's your brother, seems to me.

Like why you're buyin' a whole slew of 30 30 shells all of a sudden.

You must be plenty worried about Lednov sneakin' up on us.  Think he will?

Sure a lot of guys lookin' for Lednov.

They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.

Can I have my gun back?

Okeh, I was wrong. But you can't expect a fellow who never saw Lednov and never heard his name until a while ago to do too much worryin'. You've been sorta close mouthed about him.

Oh... that's the time you went away.

I didn't stop to think, Clay.

Yeah, how did you know?

I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know who she was.

I can't take her with me.

You're not bein' quite fair.

You can't stay here. There's snakes and it's cold and you'll just get sicker.

Helen -- why don't you and Mary go on with Clay?

I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying here where I belong.

What is it?

We tried to point that out. But there were some pretty nosey citizens who wouldn't listen to reason. They said Aspen had outgrown us. It's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon.

Maybe you're going about this all wrong. Why not try telling him we'll do the cookin' and mendin' and washin' for him. That usually works.  Yeah, but suppose he took us up on it. Where would we be?

We don't want to go there.

We might as well start a fire.

Give it back to him. We're leavin'.

He dropped a shoe. You shouldn't be ridin' him.

It wasn't Clay's fault. We've been moving around most all the time -- mebbe when we get the ranch and stay in one place I can learn my letters then --

What do they look like?

Kind of tough, I guess... But you're not liable to hunt them -- I don't think there's any alive now, anyways -- and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were...

She was only teasin'.

For the last ten miles I've been trying to figure out how to sleep sitting up. I'm getting to the point where I don't think there's any place named Sonora.

That's always tough. How long were you together?

Me, too. 101?

Ouch!!

Oh my God! We're dead!

It's coming!

Hey, look, I'm Wilma Flintstone.

Shhh... It's okay.

I just wanted to make sure you were okay.

Hey, you left your book back there.

So, I see you're really into spooks.

So it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together.

Let's get outta here.

He's here.

What are we gonna do? I'm cold. I can't move, I'm so cold.

I don't want to be your friend like this anymore.

You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...

Okay, I get the point.

Let her go, Cin.

Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing here?

Ummm!! They smell delicious.

This can't be happening?

He won't let us go. He's going to kill us.

Someone is going to have to lure him onto the platform.

Father!

Me and my friends... You see there was this ghost. He came out of nowhere and....

Left, right, left, right, crossover kick...

Got a problem with that?

Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them.

We record and document it. We're gonna make history, Dwight. The first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. The book sales alone will be worth millions. I'll be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. Now, what time is orientation?

Would you please focus?

What are you working on?

What if I wanted to borrow those keys?

Excuse me, sir, but the students have started to arrive. Dinner will be ready shortly.

Who's first? Anyone like a wing?

It's the best seat in the house. I warmed it up for you.

You mean to tell me we're dead!

No thanks.

Sorry, y'all. My bad.

BLOOD FEAST!

Did you hear?

What a bitch!

...Jenner... Jenson, Emy Lou Jenson. 3511 Clark Avenue!

Hi!

Yes murdered! You said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered too. I don't know... maybe Mom's nuts!

DAD! YOU DON'T THINK SHE DID IT??!

Turn right on Timonioum Road. Hurry, Dad!

Carl's a jerk!

Sorry, ma'am.

Oh God, really!  This is the limit!

I'm happy too and we want you to be happy.

What is it, officers? My patient is waiting.

I can't stop thinking about that poor teacher.  Goodnight, honey. Don't read late, we've got a big day with the birds tomorrow.

Don't wake the kids...

Yeah! Oohhhh! Get it!

"P" as in...

Well, this magazine was found in your trash just last night...  ...It's called "Chicks with Dicks".

Who is this?

State your name, please.

Ooohhhhhh! I made it all up! I never saw Beverly Sutphin in my life!

Who wants fruit salad?

He killed people, Mom.

0h, that's horrible, honey.  I sold the Pee-Wee Herman doll!!

That's like your car, Beverly,

Did you find your Franklin Mint egg, Rosemary darling?

Did Carl Padgett buy something you wanted?

He is assistant manager of a video shop...

SHE DID IT! Aimed the car right at Mr. Stubbins and mowed him down!

The name may not mean anything to you, young lady, but say the word and I'll have your sister for you in forty-eight hours.

That's what she told you. I looked it up at the Hall of Records. Your sister deeded her the business as an outright girt.

Then, you also understand that you must die.

When I wanted to.

Mr. Ward will see you in just a few minutes. Won't you wait, Dr. Judd?

I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward. It would endanger her.

About forty-five dollars.

But tell me --

Why, Mary --

How's Miss Jacqueline?

I don't get this. Miss Jacqueline was always so fond of you -- she was always talking about you - had your picture in her office.

Nothing's happened to her. It's just that I can't understand her not getting in touch with you.

I can't see much fun in teaching school. Why don't you go into the beauty business.

Nothing! That's absurd. I heard you laughing and talking, She was asking questions.

A man would look anywhere for her, Mary. There is something exciting and unforgettable about her - something you never get hold of - something that keeps a man following after her.

Thank you. It was a lovely dinner.

Greg, it isn't a wild tale. It's true. If there were only some way --

Please - I can't explain things like this to your right ear.

You could have told me any time you were Jacqueline's husband.

Don't. We know what happened. Don't go on.

I thought I might close up the apartment -- maybe get a place in Connecticut.

But I'm better than a detective. I have an understanding of people - and a love of them -- an understanding of the city - -

Well?

Do you think he knows about this?

He's clever and he's cautious in his way. If he knew I think he'd advise her to do what I want - surrender herself to the police  stand trial  I don't think he knows.

I'm not going to wait. I'm going out -- laugh, dance --do all the things I used to do.

If you get lonely, go down and see Mrs. Romari. I told her you were staying with me.

Were you going to make a suggestion?

I have been at the library.

I went as a detective. I found out that Mrs. Redi reads the same books as Dr. Judd.

That's it. And this figure --she traced it. The book I saw at the library had been marked "perfect" by the library inspector in March. Mrs. Redi had it out in April. No one else had read it since.

Such a simple matter. This figure is the symbol of the Palladists.

He loves you, Mary, and you'll have to tell him.

Why can't everyone be happy like we are -- laugh and have good times. Look at that poor little one  so sad because she can't find her sister. And that man with her - he doesn't make her laugh  he just sits and talks.

Why, Mr. Jason. Most of these books are on the closed shelf. You have to get permission.

See that girl? That's Jacqueline's sister. It's because of her I ask.

I think I understand without your telling me. I know something of your history, Jason. I know that you haven't written for ten years.

Following me to find Jacqueline?

Well, it won't work. Love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.

This is curious, Jason. Half the time you talk as if Shakespeare were not fit to tie your shoelaces; now this sudden humility.

A book of successful verse might have changed that, eh?

If you like, I'll go with you to dinner.

Don't be so amazed. It's a very ordinary matter. I'm Jacqueline's physician... Mr. Ward told me you were in town and Jacqueline has sent me to bring you to her.

It's my cloven hoof. It trips me up sometimes.

This is incredible I It must be some sort of a joke.

But you have never liked Jason. You always laughed at him - -quarreled with him --

Mrs. Redi, there's one thing -with Jacqueline gone, how do you carry on the business? What do you do with the receipts? How do you sign checks--?

There's nothing you can think of -- old letters, anything, that might give me some hint as to where I might find Jacqueline?

I'm afraid not.

But, Mrs. Lowood, I can't just stay here not knowing what's happened to my sister. Maybe if I went to New York -- if I saw Mrs. Redi myself --

No -- the rent in paid. The lady asked us to promise, I wouldn't open the door.

I'm sorry to be late, Natalie.

Sorry. I'm nervous. This is very trying for me.

Jacqueline, you have spoken so often of ending it all, I can't understand why this should be so difficult for you. You have only to drink a little.

Have you ever been on television?

Oh, uh-huh.

Oh, uh-huh.

Do you understand what I'm trying to say?

Do you want them?

As long as it's not... gross, you know? Like some scar or something. It has to be like mine, like something about you.

You're what?

Well... are you self-conscious about it?

Excuse me for asking, but how would you know?

Now, you said never take advice from someone that you don't know intimately, right?

So since I've never had sex with you, by your own advice I shouldn't accept your advice.

Hi!

What are these?

Donna was a girl I knew in Florida.

Yes.

What about sex?

You just ask them questions?

And they just answer them?

This is just... so...

John and Cynthia have been... "fucking".

You don't know what I'm thinking.

On tape?

Her name was Elizabeth.

Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me.

Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?

If you do get out of your marriage, will you continue to be inhibited?

Interesting analogy.

You mean you're still in contact with her?

All right, you want to talk about lies, let's talk about lies, Ann. Let's talk about lying to yourself. You haven't been able to sleep with your husband because you're no longer in love with him, and maybe you never were. You haven't been honest with yourself in longer than you can remember.

You're not answering me.

Graham...

Graham and I were talking about apartments and I told him to check the Garden District, there are some nice little places there, garage apartments and stuff.

I'm sorry, too. I... I get these ideas in my head, you know, and I have nothing to do all day but sit around and concoct these intricate scenarios. And then I want to believe it so I don't think I've wasted the whole day. Last week I was convinced you were having an affair with Cynthia, I don't know why.

Jesus Christ! What the hell happened? I came home and your car was gone, the door was open, I thought for sure you'd been abducted by some mad fucker, I was literally just calling the cops when you walked in. What happened?

You're leaving me for him, aren't you? Well, that makes a sad sort of sense. He can't, and you won't.

Answer me, godammit!! Did you make one of those tapes?

I have thought about it, yes.

But he asked you to quit your job, and you do have housework.

This unexpected visit notwithstanding, how are things with John?

What do you mean?

Well, I don't know. The week started off okay, but then I was outside watering the plants, and I started feeling dizzy from the heat and that got me thinking about the Greenhouse Effect, so I went inside and turned on the air-conditioner full blast, and that made me feel a little better until I started thinking about radon leakage coming up through the floor, and --

Yes, it's this radioactive gas in the ground, and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up, and -- you've never heard of this?

Well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you.  I knew I shouldn't have watered those plants.

What visitor?

Oh, Graham. No, I didn't talk to him about that. Actually, that turned out to be pretty interesting. I expected Graham to be this... well, like John, you know? I mean, he said they had gone to school together, so I was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff. But he turned out to be this... this kind of character, I mean, he's kind of arty but okay, you know?

Ann, in life one has to be aware of hidden agendas.  Did it occur to you that Graham may have his own reasons for not wanting you to be in therapy?

It's possible that Graham has hidden motives for disliking therapy and/or therapists. Perhaps he has problems of his own that he is unwilling to deal with, and he would like to see other people, you for instance, wallow in their situation just as he does. Do you think that's possible?

I just want to know what he looks like, is all.

What?

"My type"? What is this bullshit? How would you know what "my type" is?

Because. Cynthia, look, John was right. Graham is strange. Very strange. You don't want to get involved with him.

Well, like, I don't want to tell you, exactly.

Who are you?

She didn't tell you why she was upset?

About what?

And that's all?

How long will it take?

What did he say?

I hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time.

You should be. Can I meet this friend of yours?

Well, this is timely. Your wife is here, would you like to speak to her?

Why not?

It won't. I trust him.

Oh, please. Come on, John. You're fucking your wife's sister and you hardly been married a year. You're a liar. But at least I know you're a liar. It's the people that don't know, like Ann, that have to watch out.

Come on, John. You should be happy, we've gone this far without Ann finding out, I'm making it real easy on you. Just walk out of here and I'll see you at your house for a family dinner sometime.

I know. Will you please leave now?

Student?

Not for three-fifty.

I'm sorry. Am I prying again?

What tapes?

John, as a lawyer, you should know that those tapes are private property.

One moment.

Mr. Millaney?

Mr. Forman would like to see you in his office.

He said immediately.

You're the one who found the bodies?

It was very strange. He called me at six this morning. Hobbes called me. I thought I was dreaming. I haven't heard that voice for so long. He told me who it was, then he said something like, 'Meet me at apartment 1208 at noon. I want you to go out for lunch with me. It's time you furthered your education.' Then he laughed and hung up. I went back to sleep. He called me again at eight to remind me to come.

And that was her. Annabelle Horse... field.

Where is he now? Do you know?

Can I call you at the office?

Do you want to make love? You're absolutely beautiful, those eyes, that expression. You're absolutely the most sexy thing alive. Do you want to make love?

Make love to me, make love to me, love, love to me...

Yes? Who is there?

Good shape for an old man, eh?

NIGHT NIGHT

BREAKING OUT

BREAKING OUT

Check.  The quacks are willing tools?

About Brad's family?

I know, I know, it's just...

Do you watch 'Dentonvale,' Janet?

I know he's boring but... Neuro-specialists!  That sounds pretty drastic.

When do I get to see Brad?

But...how?

Why Janet?

Of course, Mrs. Majors -- Janet -- But I'm puzzled.  If she was so keen on getting him in here, why wouldn't she sign the contract?

A free thinker.

Macy Struthers -- God I must have been blind -- still, the weaker the man, the dumber the blonde.

Sounds like my husband.  He never came back either.  At least not after Flavors gave him a commercial break.

I'm not going, Janet.

SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EACH OTHER

Mental instability?

What are you talking about? Danny Slepstrini is a chip off the old block.  I played 18 holes of golf with his father just last week.  And Hank says Danny's moved to New York.  To better himself.

Oh, Harry.  What are we going to do?

We've heard rumors that you're going to unveil more than just a new series tonight.  Is this true?

It's only one night, Janet. Let's not forget who we're doing this for?

Poor Brad.

Oh, Mac ran up this little crowd-pleaser.

BUT WITHOUT YOU AND ME, SIS  THE WORLD'D FALL TO PIECES  VENA CAVA WHO'S THE RAVER?

Is it true they're all midgets with big heads?

He will.  But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.  And Farley's given you that chance.  You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.

Brad!

BRAD!

F for...

F for...

I FEEL THE HEAT FROM YOUR SKIN AND THE STUBBLE ON YOUR CHIN YOU'RE NO GOOD

YOU'VE GOT DIRT ON YOUR HANDS AND EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS YOU'RE NO GOOD

WHAT A JOKE...

THAT MINIMAL

She walks in beauty...

Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?

You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you.

Really? Because I don't know, I was thinking that --

Miles.

When's that novel of yours coming out?  We  all want to read it.

Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?

How's it hanging, Miles?

You okay, Miles?

Tastes good to me. You live around here, Stephanie?

Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton. Windmill Inn.

You know a gal named Maya? Works at the Hitching Post?

Why did you tell them my book was being published?

Don't open that now. It's warm.

Yeah.

Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that, you know what I mean?

No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.

Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax?

Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?

This is rose, right?

Huh. Maybe a little strawberry. Yeah, strawberry. I'm not so sure about the cheese.

We should have driven.

Yeah. Tight.

Here's to my last week of freedom.

Jack, this is where I eat when I come up here. It's practically my office. And sometimes I have a drink with the employees. Maya's great. She's worked here about a year, maybe a year and a half.

Doesn't mean shit. When Christine was a hostess at Sushi Roku, she wore a big engagement ring to keep guys from hitting on her. Think it worked? Fuck no. How do you think I met her?

The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.

Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.

Single. Waitress. Getting off work. Looking for love. A little slap and tickle.

Have you no shame?

You've been divorced for two years already. People move on. She has! It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes you feel special or something.

You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad.  It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all --

Oh, boy.

Listen, I'm going to make sure Steph and Siena get home safe, and then maybe we'll hook up with you later, okay?

That's a public course.  No Stephanie?

Don't come over the top. Stay still.

Just don't give up on Maya. Cool smart chicks like that --they like persistence.

You ever actually read any of this guy's books?

We gotta slow down.  I'm so tired. Let's just get out of here.

How about this one? We didn't hit this one.

You ever actually been in there, Miles?

Let me use your phone.

What's that supposed to mean?

That's thoughtful.

Fucking chick's married.

Ran. Twisted my ankle too.

No. She ordered them special. Took her forever to find them. They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit. We've got to go back. Christine'll fucking crucify me.

She tell you she was married?

So what the fuck were you thinking?

What the fuck!

Love you, man.

Hey, Miles. Good to see you.

I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?

You want to join us?

Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying?

What are you drinking?

On a Sauvignon Blanc?

So what gems do you have in your collection?

Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? At least that's what I've read.

The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc, that's the special occasion.

Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes.

I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.

Well...

Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos.  Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?

Hey, Miles, I heard you came by the restaurant last night looking for me.

I've told him. I've told him over and over, but he's out of control.

You know, I just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception. And I've been doing just fine.

Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.

Hello?

I just wanted you to know I've decided not to go to the wedding, so in case you were dreading some uncomfortable, you know, run-in or something, well, worry no more. You won't see me there. My wedding gift to you and what's- his-name. What is his name?

Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.

I guess I just thought there was still some hope for us somewhere down the road and I just, I just --

That was big of him.

Universally rejected. Strike three.

Well, let's go have some champagne, shall we? Toast all the newlyweds.

Pour me a full glass. I'll pay for it.

So what do you think?

Anything but the Jayer Richebourg!

That was fun last night.

Where's Jack?

So what are you up to today, Miles?

Houdini's sick.

What's the matter?

What's the rule about getting up in the middle of the night?

There's dust in it.

A hair.

Daddy.

Listen Bo. This is very important. Everything people have written about in science books is going to change. The history of the world's future is on the TV right now. We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there...  For your children Bo.

The same windows.

I don't want you to die.

Does it hurt?

...Tell Bo to listen to her brother. He'll always take care of her.

It doesn't sound natural when I curse.

Explain noises.

This guy got on the roof in like a second.

That roof is over ten feet high.

Do you think it's a possibility?

This is going to do nothing.

Did I ever tell you, I dislocated Uncle Merrill's arm?

Merrill!

They're broadcasting...

That's good enough for me.

It needs batteries.

It says they're probably very small -- like my height -- because, as their brains developed, there was no use for physical development. It says they're probably vegetarians, because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet.

Tell me something Morgan. In that book of your, did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?

You said something was strange. What's strange?

What about them?

It's not broken.

Second thing this week I can't explain.

Some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior. Sometimes violent behavior. Theo Henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow.

But I'll tell you something, what I said in their, still goes. You and your family have been through a lot in the last two days... Not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago.

And three weeks.

Is he okay?

The truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half.

I wouldn't do that. You're going to need every gun when that posse gets here.

Emmett.

More than enough.

Paden sends his best.

I'm surprised to see you out here tonight.

Goodbye?

Maybe you thought you'd be back this way someday.

Weren't you going to come out to say good-bye?

Me, I'm riding along, minding my own business. Four cowboys come by and we decide to ride together for a while, friendly as can be. I always figure you might as well approach life like everybody's your friend or nobody is... don't make much difference. We get out in the middle of that frying pan and suddenly everybody's pointing their gun but me. I guess they admired my horse. She's a great one, a sweet little bay.

I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.

I gotta be going.

Shame about the kid. Seems a lively sort.

All I'm saying is, you won't trip over me if you look her up.

Where is Rae?

Who?

You own this land.

That's a lie.

Never will again.

Mr. and Mrs. Parker have agreed to join their parcel to mine. We'll work them together.  Mine starts right over there. It's all I've ever wanted. Pretty land, isn't it?

They're drawn to me by that. But it never lasts.

J.T.'s done everything he can. I married a brave man. Augie, take that delightful gift your uncle gave you out of here while we're talking.  McKendrick picked the new sheriff himself, so J.T. can't even get the law enforced.

It was not -- it was Murdo's. Those McKendricks don't know how to act like human beings.

Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.

Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete?

Where's your brother?

I don't like that word much, Carter.

He was murdered.

What's stopping you?

Hello, Cobb.

This is mighty sweet, Paden. I think I finally found my place in the world.

You got a place to stay?

What brings you into my saloon?

Good old Paden. I was hoping you'd changed your mind about the job.

Easy, boy. Just an idea.

I'm going to have to look into this.

My compliments to you, Miss Stella. This is what I call a saloon.

What is it that I can't figure?

Why don't you just come clean, Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll feel better afterwards.

Exactly.  You're a household name now.  You're moving in entirely different worlds.  That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.

-- Do you know what these are, Elaine?

-- I have a feeling you're going to tell me.

The picture's dead.

They're yours.  But how are you going to finish it?  Without a star there's no movie.

Why isn't she with you?

Viktor, we simply have to talk about "Eternity..."

She was in the theater?  When? Where?

Al least a contingency for wardrobe.  Any woman can go up a dress size.

Well, we have to do something about this -- "stuntwoman".

As I've tried to explain to you, Elaine.  Simone isn't like any other actress you've ever known. She's about the work and only the work -- lives for the work.  She wants all the money up there...  ... on the screen where it belongs. She'd work for scale except I know you only respect people you pay a fortune.

Not today.  She's learning her lines.  You can also take cue cards and teleprompter out of the budget.

Experience, Viktor.  I've seen this a hundred times -- young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.  I'm worried about you, that's all.  This woman -- she controls your destiny.

Yes.  To be honest I never quite saw this film before -- maybe it's the way Simone is playing it -- but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life, how that's the only way we can love -- I think it's really going to mean something.

-- It's starting to look like she doesn't support the film or you, Viktor.  If you can't handle her, I will.

Really?

Are you and Simone...  ... getting married?

Yes, you do...  Anyway, tonight was a good start.

About now.  Would you like a drink?

Is Simone back to earth yet?

I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. She's lucky to have you, Viktor.  Is she really having your baby?

This is crazy.  Who am I fooling? I can't compete with Simone.  What woman can?

Of course she will.  Her public will demand it.

Hello?

Let's go, Lainey.  There's nothing here.

Of course.  What are you suggesting?

I can't believe she's doing this -- taking advantage of him this way. It's cruel.

You understand you'll have to come back to my place to keep them off the, er...  ... scent.

What?... What did you say?

You're with me to be close to her?

The film.  The chemistry.  No reflections on Nicola but Simone and I -- we were just so right together.

Yes, perfect.  As a matter of fact, I ran into Simone on the lot the other day.

Hal, what are you doing?

No.  In fact, between us, she doesn't really exist.

An eye -- for performance.  You know the truth when you see it.  I know.  I've seen your movies.  I love your movies.

"Straw God" changed my life.

Don't feel too bad.  Mom runs the place and they still walk all over her.  You're better off out of it.

Me too.

You know, I... don't know.

Those things can be dangerous. Staring at a screen all day -- you miss what's going on outside in the real world.  You can lose yourself. You should get out more.  How are you going to meet boys?

You do?  Still?  I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.

Okay, Dad.

Good-night, Daddy.

I love you, Lainey.

The old Viktor Taransky.  I liked you better before -- before all this.  You were a loser, Dad, but at least you had integrity.  I can't stand to see you like this -- clinging to Simone's coattails -- it used to be about the work, and now it's all about her.  And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.

About you and mom?

-- No!  I can't go along with this horseshit!  Just tell them they can fry me!

Don't you have a real story to write?  Why aren't you in Latin America?

The cops?  The cops read my column to know who to bust.  We're the only watchdog the public has.  None of this is going away.  We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that.  Until you slip up.  And you will.  You are looking at your shadow.  Because all these elaborate precautions with Simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural.

Nice boat, Taransky.

I do?  Sure I do.  Can we speak off the record?  I'm a fair man.  I'm willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story.

You love her, don't you, Max?

Is it a jamming device?

Taransky isn't that good an actor. No, they're taking special precautions.  Some kind of new encryption.

It's the biggest on earth!  I swear!  It's a 50-foot Airstream -- they don't make them any longer than that.

A lot's happened since we last saw each other.

Thank you.  It's not important.

No one came in or went out just like you said, Mr. Taransky.

Is Miss Simone coming today?

You mean they buy it?

I am the death of real.

Mahogany. I'd say that cost at least a couple hundred. Maybe three.

Wow. They called you their son.

Are you calling me?

Why, Malcolm?

Your eye frames. They don't seem to have any lenses in them.

All your soldiers speak Latin?

Know what?

Mr. Marschal gets real lonely.

I told you what I want.

Don't cry.

And you know what else?

It was Grandma's. It's not for playing.  What if it broke? You know how sad I'd be.

Someone got hurt.

Cole, you're scaring me.

Dead people?

She says she's sorry for taking the bumble bee pendant. She just likes it a lot.

She wanted me to tell you--

Yes, Cole?

That's not correct. Where'd you hear that?

I don't like people looking at me like that.

I don't know how else to look--

...He doesn't get invited places.

I work at an insurance place and at Penny's, so Cole can go to that good school.

'Course, some folks say 'ol Jethro shouldn't have been buried up here... with the rest of the Macdonalds.

Maybe you don't want to remember.

'Course, it's none of my business.

Could take a little while, though.

Fuck you! If you're such an expert on music, why don't you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song?

You have a strong unfufilled desire.

Aha. The Lovers.

Looks like the alternator.

I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...

You're not going to arrest me for it, are you?

Hey. Fuck you.

"Peggy-Sue" --

So... what does it do?

"Old Macdonald... had --"

Carl! Oh Carrrrl!

That old barn. After the fire... I rebuilt it nail by nail. Just the way your granddaddy would've wanted it.

Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts, now are you?

You got it wrong, boy. I'm not the monster you think.

Then who?! Because someone wants another blood harvest. With human blood, Jeremiah! Just like Jethro! Who did he kill back then, Jeremiah? Farmhands? Transients? People no one would miss? "Crazy Old Macdonald!" But now... it's starting again, isn't it? Someone's picking up where Jethro left off!

Think boy. That night. The night of the fire. At the barn. You were only six years old.

Throw me one.

-- And keep your eyes on the road.

Is that all you ever think of? Suppose I was really hurt!

Ow!

Jesus. What a bunch of useless zombies.

You know what they say about men who need big guns...

Yeah. Maybe I can pick a little cotton for da masta.

You wanna know the difference? The difference is that you're screwing up the song.

Try taking a left after the next cow pasture.

Time for a little... "feedback" guys. That guy from Hectic Records --

How'd you get that? Playing with your pitchfork?

Strange... I can feel my old self coming back...

What are --

Get out of here.

Carl.

Someone better tell Mac.

Shit.

What?

What you up to?

Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. Me.

No reception out here.

That wasn't a good night, no.

We'll just head up here into Bishopville, get checked up in the hospital. Then maybe we'll head off to Hollywood after all, huh?

What the hell are we going to do?!

I think we best get you to a hospital right quick.

You dig that rat out of the hole?

Megan Halesy' little sister.

Flip.

Where are you going?

I never danced in a towel before.

Welcome home.

I loved you. I loved --

Where'd he go?

I hear a few weeks ago you smuggled sixteen Beaners up to West Virginia.

Driving, talking to me...

You have a great profile.

Where you from?

Anything?

You know, you're not a bad driver.

That's a Texas cop. What the hell's he doing in Arkansas?

Well?

Christ, what channel are we on?...

The bus'll pick you up over there.  Uh... you got enough bread for a ticket?

Mississippi's the other way!

Let's hit it.

I'm sure the Arkansas Bears put out an all-points.

What kind of a guy is he?

Why are you stopping?

Well, at least it hasn't been boring.

What are you thinking?

Why should I?

I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.

No what?

That means we gotta average ninety- four miles per.  Forget it.

Now, if I say go to channel three, it really means go to six.

If I say go to twenty-one, go to nineteen.

Loud and clear.

You can't swear on these.

Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.

I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.

She's losing minutes so you better start running interference or we're never gonna make it. Might I remind you this was your brainstorm.

My vocal cords are fine, but Fred's ain't. He's been barking, eating the seats and driving me crackers.  Hear that? Where's his chow?

Do I have a choice?

-- Gimme a twenty, pardner.

I thought you were dumping the chick at the truck stop.

Ran into a little hassle at the eatum- up-stop.

Just fine. What's the weather like?

I'm all ears.

You're coming up to the scale house.

How's the clock, Bandit II.

Bandit, I just thought I'd lay a Smokey report on you.

Shut up, Fred.

Why don't we just rent a Lear jet and haul it back ourselves?

But if it can't be done, how's he gonna do it?

It's gotta be tough keeping an eye on everything.

But with these down, doesn't that pose a major security concern if, as you say, you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?

Right now? A six man security force, plus a member of our Butler staff. So seven men total.

I tell you, engineering this kind of play against Sparazza, going to the lengths these guys are going to... they're playing some long odds.

So he has no idea what's about to happen?

He's giving them up?

What about the sheriff's task force?

How bad?

No.

This man wearing the jacket identified himself as an Federal agent?

You're sure?

If I needed your I.D. and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law, I woulda killed you to get 'em too.

Man, that's great.

What happened?

I know his location, we've got the drop of a maybe half a day before that location gets grape-vined and the rest of the world gets hipped.

...I'm sorry...

I am. Yeah.

Baby, I've been co-habitating with these people for the past thirty odd hours and in so doing, have stared into the face of hell. These are the premier prick cocksuckers of all time and I feel beaten by them, I feel bloodied --

-- Buddy, it's bigger than that, they want 'em all, Ivy, Beanie --

Buddy, they revoked the deal, they pulled it...

Sparazza is rumored to have performed in excess of one-hundred and thirty contract murders, including one of the bureau's most celebrated agents. Freeman Heller. You heard of "The Turnpike Murders" that was Sparazza.

A marked man gets wise and wants to come in.

On an extradition flight back to El Salvador, he murdered a security detachment and vanished.

...Does he know?

Sparazza was in failing health and looking for a donor. The son who had betrayed and burned him so thoroughly seemed a obvious choice.

...Yeah, fifty-three.

...So you knew all this and yet y--

...while Carruthers and a dozen others lie dying, you debate semantics. The Bureau's betrayed us...  The way they betrayed him...

-- yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose --

Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.

Shoot.

No shit.

Right, you got clicks, anything?

Well, I'm hearin' the Swede's been dispatched, he's flying so --

-- never in a million girl --

I feel like I know you girl. I feel like I've known you forever.  You gonna lemme see your scars?

Nuthin', we cool. There was somethin' about a fed being in the building.

He a dog babydoll. He a great dane. I tried to tell y'after ya'll first date. He hit that ass one time, his interest in a bitch start t'landslide.

Girl, lemme ask you somethin' and I want you t'tell me straight up, since I got my suspicions and y'know I ain't one t'talk circles... you gay?

Ain't nuthin' wrong wit' it.

What's wrong?

They musta been beefin' big time with one another, cuz this shit, got way past words, whatever it was.

I DON'T KNOW!

Bulllllshit...

Forty-five apiece for you two, ten percent finders fee for me.

What I'm saying is: Don't trust anyone.  Find yourself a weapon of some sort.

What happened to Gibarian?

Where's his body?

You killed her!

You didn't bring any chocolate, did you?

Was her breakfast conversation that bad?

Probably.

Can you meet me and Sartorius on B deck in an hour?

Is it being deliberately cruel, you mean?  I don't think so.

Of course, when we return, we'll be regarded as lunatics if we tell the truth.  We'll chalk it up to isolation, collective derangement.

They come when you sleep.

What happened?

What do you want?

What's wrong with you?  We need your help.

I need to see Snow.

Not a very happy poem.

I wasn't.

You want to fuck her?

Is it a planet?

Is it intelligent?

I would have these -- I don't know how to describe them -- visions, when I was younger.  Maybe not visions, but like these waking dream states.  Time would just collapse, I would be inside time.  I would stare at a second hand on a clock until it stopped.  Freaky stuff.

Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you.  I loved it so much, that feeling.

I can't help feeling that I'm cheating when I take them.

Do you have any idea how much I like fucking you?

What's wrong.

But we fought.

Was she right?

You don't want me.

No.

You're lying.

I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the woman you loved ten years ago.

What are you taking?

How can you be here...

We thought you'd be alone.  We want to talk about...

They are not autonomous individuals and they're not actual persons. They are projections materializing from our minds, based on a given individual.

Gibarian was under enormous --

I got rid of him.  I wanted to see if... I wanted to be the only one. I wanted to be Snow.

Looks a little constipated to me.

Straight ahead.

I think, maybe, that isn't such a great idea...

Do you have another tie?  Something more conservative?

What did he say?

Are you nervous?

Put it on my account, please.

People think I'm stepping out on Neil.  We're causing quite a scandal.

You were reading my Renoir.

You mean to tell me, a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way?

And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!

No dog.

What about Neil?

You could do better.

Stop, will you?!

You told her?

I'm taking them all out to Queens, as a matter of fact, right in your neighborhood.  There's an event at my Father's school... an anniversary... I thought maybe you could come...

They guys treatin' you all right?

I've been doing a lot of thinking.

Say goodbye, Mike.

Well, of course, we'd be... honored...

... just saying you should think twice about it...

We're not going to the game, are we Mom?

Tommy...!

Think I should put the skateboard in bed with him?

Mike?

Don't start... The only reason is that the neighborhood's shi...  ... crummy.  I just don't like the idea of leaving you alone here at night.

Okay?

She's got to identify him.

Coming to bed?

Should I wait up?  We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.

Mike, take it easy...

C'mon, don't make an issue of it. Do you want the fucking meatloaf or not?

I don't know how you did it, but whatever it was, keep doing it.

What about when she goes out?

No One-Seventeen, they'll fuck it up!  He told me not to tell anybody, to bring Claire and come alone!  He won't wait, he knows I'm two minutes away!  Koontz, please!

Uh, yeah.  I'm a policeman.

Are you in charge here?

I asked for the man in charge...

Why should she come in?

Bullshit!  Prove it.

I want your guarantee they'll be turned loose when she opens the front door.

Watch your step!

Nice threads Dad.

How about dinner tonight?

We're not going to a singing lesson, she's just gonna start taking singing lessons.

Shooting.

Time to get my bowling ball re drilled.

Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.

Lizzy!

Mistake?  Hey, guy, get back here!

Flash, get lost.

And you let me go on about Rosomoff working me too hard?  I feel like a complete idiot.

Oh, I need your notes from the classes I missed.

You can be great, kid, just stick with it. But let me give you one little piece of advice... be a good guy.

Thank you.  Now, repeat after me-- Spider-Man is a good guy. On the side of right, and niceness, and cute baby animals and all that.

What's this? A cockaroach?

Is that bug juice, or are you just glad to see me?

All right, amazing.  Are you quite finished?

Are you quite finished?

I hate--

Oh, don't do it on my account--

This from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?

Well, no.

Hello.  Earth to Peter.  Are you listening?

Hello, Liz.

This may be the end of a beautiful friendship, you know.

You were the last one to see Thorkel.  In Octavius' hospital room.

No such thing as coincidence.  "God does not play dice with the universe."

Roz? Rosomoff?  What is it?

I am old enough to--

Absolutely no class.

Peter, you're bleeding.

Is this some sort of Zen thing?

In this obsolete little cyclotron, I'm solving the greatest physics problem of the 20th Century.  With more power, I could--

Mr. Parker.

Peter, what can I do for you?

Your dog ate it.

Really.  I'd like to speak with him.

Why? It is a wrestling match, or

So they're airing this tonight?

He'll try to finish his experiment.

Loonytunes.  And yet...

Do you... live around here?

Up here, Docky Ocky!

How did he ever find out about that ammunition train?

Do Cagney. Like you did yesterday.

Throws what? How could he have a time bomb?

What's the match gag?

Where's Hoffy? Why don't we get any news about Dunbar?

What's the matter? You on their team now? You think I'm the guy?

Why not? Just one of the boys. Sharing our bunks. Eating our chow. Right in amongst the ones that beat me up. Except that he beat hardest.

So long, Cookie. The department store is all yours. What's left of it.

What's your beef, boys? So I'm trading. Everybody here is trading. Only maybe I trade a little sharper. So that makes me a collaborator.

You would, would you? Listen, Stupe -- the first week I was in this joint somebody stole my Red Cross package, my blanket and my left shoe. Well, I wised up since. This ain't no Salvation Army -- this is everybody for himself. Dog eat dog.

I suppose they also know about your distillery and the horseraces?

Next we're going to auction off your department store -- and your stable.

Lieutenant Dunbar? It wouldn't be James Schuyler Dunbar? From Boston?

What did you expect, a St. Bernard dog?

What some brandy?

Nine-thirty. General von Pfeffinger should be at his desk by now. Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?

Jawohl?

Why don't we accept, Animal? The worst that can happen is we wind up a couple of lamp shades.

You want Betty Grable!

What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!

No, Animal.

You did?

Sugar-lips Shapiro! Frightening, ain't it?

Why don't we just look in those footlockers?

Come on, Animal -- let's trip the light fantastic!

Let me do it, Hoffy.

Sergeant Hoffman from Barrack 4.

...a Lieutenant James Dunbar?

Look -- if you don't like the way I'm handling this job --

You're wasting your time, Duke.  Outside, everybody! Let's get it over with.

It's not Schulz. It's that stoolie. Whoever he is, he's sure batting a thousand.

Sometimes I think he is fooling us with that crazy business.

We know! We got them last year. Five minutes after the Geneva Man was gone, the blankets were gone.

You must get out. For your own good, you must get out.

Anybody call?

If you can't get the BBC, how about getting Guy Lombardo?

What's it add up to you, Sefton?

You'll stay in this barracks and not a peep out of you.

What are we going to do with him?

Yeah?

When the Krauts find that gadget they'll throw us all in the boob.

Or how about a game of pinochle? No, you're not a pinochle man. You're a chess player.  I haven't played since I was a kid. Let's see --  -- a pawn moves this way, doesn't it? And a bishop this way? And the queen -- every which way, doesn't it?

I went to school with a guy named Price. But that was in Boston. You're from Cleveland, aren't you.

Stop that, will you!  Those idiots! So they sprang Dunbar! So what good is it? He's still in the compound, isn't he? How long can he last? Where can they hide him?

The what?

Schulz, you're off your nut!

Three hundred cigarettes! What is it you want from me?

I do not want those cigarettes.

What's the matter with you? You want to be killed?

My grandmother's ear-muffs.

Have a nice time over there?

So you're stuck with me, eh?

Where is he now?

According to our information, the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through our galaxy every 39.1 years

Give me a list of those effects. I want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed, no matter how insignificant.

Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. It's something we all have to learn to deal with.

No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.

"Lifeforms tiny little lifeforms. Where are the lifeforms-"

Data, you're not thinking about using that thing are you?

The Farpoint mission? Data, that was seven years ago.

Can you locate them?

Guinan. It's important that you tell me what you know. We think Soran's developed a weapon...a terrible weapon. It might give him enough power to-

That ribbon isn't just some random energy phenomenon travelling through space. It's a doorway. It leads to another place- the Nexus. It doesn't exist in our universe and it doesn't play by the same rules either.

Guinan, what's going on? Where am I?

Guinan, can I leave the Nexus?

I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.

So you're telling me this is the 24th-century, and I'm dead?

Captain of the Enterprise, huh?

Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?

The first thing you learn as captain is how to cheat death.  Scotty?

But I do have a theory...

An anti-matter discharge directly ahead=8A it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away.

Aye.

Kirk here.

A remarkable piece of equipment, but a little inelegant, wouldn't you say?  Have you ever considered a prosthesis that would make you look a little more...normal?

Let's try to move beyond the usual prisoner-interrogator banter, shall we? You have information and I need it.  Did the Captain explain his orders to you? Did he say why you were searching for trilithium?

What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?

Oh, I forgot to tell you. While you were unconscious, I injected a nano-probe into your bloodstream. It's been navigating your cardiovascular system, and right now I've attached it to your left ventricle.  A little trick I picked up from the Borg.

We learn something new about ourselves every day.  Now. Maybe I didn't make myself clear. It is very important that you tell me exactly what Captain Picard knows.

Don't you think you're taking this a little too far, Number One?

Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.

Report.

That's a pretty big margin of error.

Counselor. What can I do for you?

Doctor Soran?

These blast patterns are consistent with Type III disruptors.

An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it.

Have Geordi and Data go over with the next Away Team. Tell them to scan the observatory for trilithium.

I have spoken to the Klingon High Council, sir. They identified the Bird of Prey as belonging to the Duras sisters.

Tractor beam, aye!

Transwarp at your command, Sir!

Mr. Chekov -- ?

Shall I alert Dr. McCoy?

You did great, Bones... Just great.

Response?

What's Grissom up to?... Will they join us, or fire on us...?  Chekov, break radio  silence. Send my compliments to Captain Esteban.

Sir, the shields... Non- responsive.

Do you wish to advise Starfleet, sir?

I don't believe it...

All right -- get your gear. I'll put you down next time around.

It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!

All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!

Same sector. Metallic mass.

Approximately two meters long... Cylindrical in form...

Captain, please -- we'll take the risk. We've <u>got</u> to find out what it is...

.          .. Spock's tube...

Later. Let's go...

It's time for total truth between us.  This planet is not what you intended, or hoped for, is it?

Did your collaborator know?

Very well. Exercise caution, Lieutenant. This landing is Captain's discretion and I'm the one who's out on a limb.

I'm sure Starfleet would approve, sir.

Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?

What's wrong?

Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.

Yes, Admiral. But that may not be possible.

I know you... Do I not?

Excelsior, the great experiment, is adrift in space.

See! That shimmering area.

If I read this right, sir, we have full power.

How is Doctor McCoy, sir?

Jim... You are my best officer and if I had a best friend, you'd be that too. But I am Commander, Starfleet, so I don't break rules!

Out of the question! The Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis!

Yes... I hear you.  I just had to try.

Do not lecture me about treaty violations. The Federation, in creating an ultimate weapon, has become a gang of Intergalactic criminals. It is not I who will surrender, it is you.  On the planet below, I have three prisoners from the team who developed your doomsday weapon. If you do not surrender immediately, I will execute them, one at a time, as enemies of galactic peace.

Genesis, I want it.

Yes. Exhilarating, isn't it!

Ambassador, I -- I had no idea you were here...  I think you know my crew...

But -- why?

Bones!...

What you ask is difficult.

What about Spock?

We are going to this "planet." Even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the Federation, we will <U>act</U> for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!

I'll be in my quarters. Execute course to the Federation Boundary.

The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all sense of reality?

It's new -- have you any idea what you're saying?

Bless me, doctor; and what beams you into this neck of the woods?

Romulan Ale! Bones, you know this stuff is illegal --

Damn it, Jim, what the hell's the matter? Other people have birthdays. Why're we treating yours like a funeral?

Don't mince words, Bones; tell me what you really think.

But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control --

Jim... read me? Can you read me?

... Can't read you... repeat...

... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...?

Captain Kirk was your host! You repaid his hospitality by trying to steal his ship and murder him.

Beyond what I told you, sir, it is classified information.

It's the Genesis Wave!

I don't mean to intrude.

What are you looking at?

Steady on course. All systems normal.

We'll lose them if they go in there.

Give me some time to recall the data on our computers --

Khan, how do I know you'll keep your word?

You are in a position to demand nothing, sir. I, on the other hand, am in a position to grant nothing. What you see is all that remains of the ship's company and the crew of the <u>Botany Bay</u>, marooned here fifteen years ago by Captain James T. Kirk.

Captain... We're waiting. What's the delay?

I'll need ten minutes, sir, 'til the radiation dissipates.

I'm getting a voice message... wait ... short range band. They say their Chambers coil is shorting their COMM system.

Mr. Scott on discrete.

... No response, sir.

Enterprise to Reliant: you are ordered to surrender your vessel. Respond!  Nothing, sir.

Admiral, I've got to take the mains off the line. The energizer's shaken loose and I can't get in there to fix her -- radiation --

Kirk to Enterprise. Damage report, Spock?

I assume you are loitering here to learn what efficiency rating I plan to give your cadets.

There's a first time for everything, Admiral.

I told Starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but we're the only ship in the quadrant. Spock: those cadets of yours -- how good are they? How will they respond under real pressure?

You are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions.

There are two possibilities, sir they are unwilling to respond, they are unable to respond.

One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.

Let's hope he hasn't changed the combination. He's quite intelligent...

Affirmative, Admiral.

All right, join the party. Mr. Spock, the ship is yours.

That's it?

... the good of the few...

I never took the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u> test -- until now. What do you think of my solution?

Captain Spock, if you do not hear from us within <u>one hour</u> your orders are to restore what power you can, take the Enterprise to the nearest Star Base and alert Starfleet command when you are out of jamming range.

Any suggestions, Admiral?

A no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face. Has that never occurred to you?

I did not think so.

May I ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?

Reliant's command...

That was close --

Saavik, get us out, best speed!

Time from my mark...

Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well.

Yes, well, why don't you show him around and...

I really must thank you.

I cut your new orders personally. By the end of the month, you'll have your first command: USS EXCELSIOR.

I can't get power, sir!

Sir, you did it.

May I remind the Captain that if a Starship enters the zone --

Shields activated!

Very well, Mr. Saavik, clear all moorings.

Certainly...

The question is irrelevant.

As you wish, since you deem them of value. But I cannot wait here to find them.

I would accept that as an axiom.

I know. I feel the same thing. But we're between a rock and a hard place. We can't keep them without risking their lives and we can't let them go without a taking the same chance.

Sorry if I spoke out of turn.

Professor Scott, I'm Dr. Nichols, plant manager. I'm terribly sorry but there's been an awful mix-up Would you believe I was never told about your visit?

He never jokes... Perhaps the professor could use your computer.

You sure this is such a bright idea?

Are you sure?  That's what I thought.

You're really going to try this time travel in this rust bucket?

He's coming 'round, Jim...

Congratulations, Jim. I think you've saved the Earth.

Forget it...  How 'bout covering a little philosophical ground? Life, Death, Life... Things of that nature?

Spock, it's me, Bones! I mean our experience was unique. You really have gone where no man has gone before. Can't you tell me what it felt like?

You just said there aren't any except on Earth of the past.

Guess, Spock. Your best guess.

Damage report!

All right, Commander, you wanna tell us anything?

My name is Pavel Chekov. I am a Lt. Commander in Starfleet, United Federation of Planets, service number 656-5827b.

Operational, Admiral. Cloaking Device now available in all modes of flight.

We are in an enemy wessel, sir. I didn't wish to be shot down on thee way to our own funeral.

"Neutralized?" How?

Attempting the hell to communicate.

You mean man...

Thanks.

Memory problems, too.

Iowa.

Can I ask <u>you</u> something?

They're gonna hafta take their chances.

Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?

Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.

Well, "Admiral," that may be the strangest dinner of my life and the biggest cockamamie fish story I've ever heard.

It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.

All I need is the radio frequency to track them.

You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.

You mean this is -- goodbye?

That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth.

Mr. Spock, your computations?

If memory serves, there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side effects. By the beginning of the fusion era, these reactors had been replaced, but at this time, we should be able to find some.

As you observed, a primitive Culture.

Oh, the complete works of Jacqueline Susan, the novels of Harold Robbins....

No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do.

Can we make breakaway speed!?

Warp Nine... Nine point two... Nine point three...

Maintaining impulse climb. Wing five by zero, helm steady.

10,000 M.S.L., Admiral.

I have no control, sir!

Let's see what she's got, Mr. Sulu.

Any luck...?

Bearing!

I can't, sir -- Nothing!

Excelsior? Why in God's name would you want that bucket of bolts?

Well, Saavik. I guess this is goodbye.

Even as the Federation negotiated a peace treaty with us, Kirk was secretly developing the Genesis torpedo! Conceived by Kirk's son and test detonated by the Admiral himself!  The result of this awesome energy was euphemistically called "The Genesis Planet..." A secret base from which to launch the. annihilation of the Klingon people!  We demand the extradition of Kirk! We demand justice!

Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?

Hello? Computer...?

It is kind of you to make this effort.

Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?

Chotto omachi nasarei. Namae wa nanto moosareruka na.  Wait my son. What is your name?

I understand how you feel. We just want to retrace Data's movements that day...

Deceive us?

An apprentice for thirty years.  We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?

I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.

When we're forced away by the terrain, we'll use transport inhibitors to compensate. The mountains have the highest concentrations. Once we're there, transport will be virtually impossible...

There's a cavern at the base of the next hill...

But I have three hundred and eighteen days of vacation time coming. I plan on using them.

My father told me I shouldn't talk to you.

Don't you ever get tired?

Very funny...

Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship...

Will he live?

She's stabilizing.

'his nose should pant and his lip should curl...'

Incomplete, I might add.

I'm showing fresh air  behind this calcite formation, Captain...

Your self-restraint puzzles me, Admiral. You continue to deny yourself every benefit this mission has to offer...

Your android has turned dangerously violent, Captain... Considerable damage was done to my ship. He must be destroyed.

In stasis. La Forge is completing the diagnostic.

The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.

On Earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders. Warp drive transformed a bunch of Romulan thugs into an empire. We can handle the Son'a, I'm not worried about that...

With metaphasics, lifespans will be doubled... an entire new medical science will evolve...  I understand your Chief Engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life... would you take his sight away from him?

The concentration in the rings is what makes the whole damned thing work. Don't ask me to explain it. I only know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic reaction. After it's over, the planet will be unlivable for generations.

Our best scientific minds already have. We can't find any other way to do this.

It would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition. Some of them won't survive that long. Besides, they don't want to live in the middle of The Briar Patch... who would?

The countdown control has been transferred to the collector...I can't override...

Gallatin! So the righteous Starfleet Captain finally released you. Did you encounter any problems on the surface?

The injector performs perfectly in every simulation...

Aye, sir. Highly volatile...I recommend we keep our distance...

Sir, they've detonated an isolytic burst... a subspace tear is forming...

They need us to mediate some territorial dispute...

... and gorgonzolla cheese.

Worf to Picard...

Worf, you must hurry...

Come out, come out wherever you are...

Do you know Gilbert and Sullivan?

Debrief them again.  Have you been in a fight, Commander?

Isolinear tags. Their transporters can lock onto them.

All hands. Battle stations!

Initiate launch sequence.

Your scanners must be malfunctioning.

This ship is equipped with fourteen long range transporters... are they all useless...?

What are we waiting for? Let's go.

There must be some good people... even in this time.

But I had a little help. Surgical transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain.

Regardless of how I may feel about Ruby... our fates lie along different paths. Nothing can change that.

Beverly, there were many reasons why you and I...

Dispersive armor is holding.

The Borg ship has modified its shields, Captain. Our phasers will no longer be effective.

Where's the battery room for the hospital?

This used to be the throttle valve assembly.  It controls the thrust of the engines. It's been completely vaporized... and without it, there's no way to launch the ship.

Ready to make a little history?

Captain... we've got less than ten minutes before that Vulcan ship leaves the system. We've got to go <U>now</U>.

No... the door's too thick.

Entering the upper ionospere...

Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.

Their com system must still be down.

Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning...

What do you want?

There is no invasion...

From another planet.  Oh, I almost forgot... they have green blood and pointed ears.

Take care of him. He's a very special man.

Okay, let's hear it. I'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house.

Friends from Cornell...

Lie. That's one. Keep going.

All right. Truth. I believe that one. Why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?

Why are you being so difficult? All I'm asking for is to look at one of the photographs. It'll take five minutes.

Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...

Life signs?

Time travel... they're attempting time travel...  Full power, Mister Data. Worf, quantum torpedoes at my command!

Captain, there are five Borg ships closing in on our position.

Phasers are off-line... we have two quantum torpedoes left. But the computer targeting system has been destroyed.

Target locked!

They must've done it in the past... they went back and changed history...

Return to our own time?

A ship-wide decompression has been initiated!

What the hell is happening, Worf?

To control the Enterprise, they'll have to gain access to one of two locations. Main Engineering... or the Bridge.

We have to stop them from sending that message.

And Commander, whatever you do... do <U>not</U> vomit in your exo-suit. It would be... unpleasant.

Worf! I'm going to need at least five minutes!

Report.

Someone...?

All right... we've lost control of eight decks... three Cargo Bays... one Shuttlebay.

Worf? Is something wrong?

No response.  I'm not reading any Starfleet com traffic in this entire sector.

They may be trying to send a message to the other Borg...the Borg in this time period...

I'd prefer not to be the President to push the button if I can avoid it.

Good luck, Captain.

I'm going to perform surgery on a torpedo - you never know...

What the Hell's going on?

Sweet Jesus...! He's lost a lot of whatever this stuff is...

Thanks...

Well, don't be too hard on yourself - we all felt exactly the same -

We're explorers not diplomats!

Captain, when we get to Camp Khitomer, how will we defend ourselves? I mean, if this new Bird of Prey can fire while she is invisible...?

Too bad we can't SMELL her.

I didn't have the knowledge of Klingon anatomy I needed.

I tried to save him! I was desperate to save him! He was the last best hope in the universe for real peace.

What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?

"To be or not to be, that is the question" which preoccupies our people, Captain Kirk. We need BREATHING room...

Are those your words?

You deny Enterprise fired on KRONOS One?

Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?

From Starfleet?

Where IS the conference?

Klingon blood.

Aye, sir.

Thank you, Captain Kirk. The evening has been most... edifying.

Isn't it about time you became something else?

Listen. No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.

I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.

Stand DOWN, Mr. Scott. All stop. That's an order.

Uhura, hailing frequencies. Right standard rudder, bring us alongside...

I hope you're happy.

This is Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior.

According to my information, today.

Me?

How could you vouch for me? That's...  ... arrogant presumption -

Spock, I'm really tired...

You couldn't have known she was listening the night I dictated that entry into my log. You were proud of her achievements as a Vulcan.

But I am not human. I am only -

The only way to find out if a man's trustworthy...

Control tower, reading, Sir.

Uhura?

Curious. You haven't been assisting Commander Uhura with her radio transmissions, have you, Lt?

Any progress?

Suppose when they returned they threw the boots into the garbage?

In nineteenth century France, workers who felt their livelihood threatened by machines, flung their wooden shoes - called SABOTS - into the gears to stop them. Hence the word SABOTAGE.

We can send a message to Starfleet Command -

Sorry to wake you, sir, but Starfleet urgently requests any data we may have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.

According to this we've completed our exploration of the entire sector.

Praxis?

It's as I said, Mr. Spock: Inventory still registers every torpedo.

That could take hours!

Twenty-four hours from now we won't have a clue where the Captain is.

They dinna fire on themselves. And there were no other ships present.

Too far off. Very near us. Perhaps... underneath us...

A Bird of Prey canna fire when she's cloaked!

- could take weeks, sir.

And they'd be right. We have no evidence - just a theory that happens to fit the facts...

I've pulled out my - uh wooden shoe and Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.

They might as well arrest me, too; I felt like Lieutenant Saavik.

Can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you?

Do you know where you are?

Why?

Why?

Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?

I notice Dr. Crusher laughing along with the rest of you. As most of you know, the doctor will also soon be leaving the Enterprise, to assume command of Starfleet Medical. Again, I'm forced to ask, Beverly, have you considered what you're doing to little ole me?! I'll probably get some old battle-axe of a doctor who'll tell me to eat my vegetables and put me on report if I dont show up for my physical on time!

It has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level. I can't overestimate the danger of Thalaron radiation, Jean Luc. A microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds.

Beverly, come in.

He is very observant.

Yes.

He may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin

How can you be sure?

We are passing through the Bassen Rift. The projections will return when we have cleared it.

Why am I looking at me?

I feel nothing, Geordi. It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual.

May I have this dance?

It's about Data  I've watched him with the B-9 and I'm troubled. Data's desire for a "family" is very strong. I'm afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9.

The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.

Imzadi. This is so good.

He can never know you as I know you... He can never touch you as I touch you.

The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.

I read six distinct positronic signatures, spread out over a few kilometers on the surface.

That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations. It's not even restricted material.

You have the bridge, Commander. Use all available power to move away from the Scimitar.  Now, Mister La Forge.

With or without the rest of the fleet?

 Believe me, we don't under- stand it either. You're the closest ship so I want you to high tail it over there and hear what he has to say. Get the lay of the land, If the Empire becomes unstable, it could mean trouble for the entire quadrant.

I'm preparing her for Shinzon. To sooth him as she soothes you. To stand at his side as she does at yours.

Sir, I recommend we raise shields.

Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.

Sir, we're being hailed.

What's this?

Captain, I hope I don't have to remind you --

Why don't they answer our hails?

She's not out for a pleasure cruise.

Not very chatty.

The Titan's a fine ship, will. And she's getting a captain worthy of her.

Anything.

Praetor?

Right now, youre thinking this all sounds too good to be true?

Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.

For thousands of years the Romulan Senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sister-planet... But the time has come for us to live as equals.

I want to know  where I come from. The Remans gave me a future. You can tell me about my past.

With a full head of hair.

If there's one ideal the Federation holds most dear it's that all men, all races, can be united. From the first time the Vulcans came to Earth we've sought a future of peace. Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friend- ship. In time. When trust has been earned.

In time, Jean Luc.

It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...

And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see?  Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?

My life is meaningless as long as you're alive. What am I while you exist? A shadow? An enigma?

It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.

To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.

I know you as well as I know myself, Shinzon. There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.

Not so long.

The man who is Jean Luc Picard and Shinzon of Remus won't exterminate the population of an entire planet! He is better than that!

Well, that sounds relaxing too.

Minimal damage to the Scimitar.

Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.

The bond is broken.

It's accelerating. You have no more time for games.

How long until we reach the Rift?

Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?

I thought we discussed patience, Commander.

Benny, God, take it easy...

I'll take that.

Credit card.

Food. Eat. I prepare food. I work as a cook. That's how I make money.

Well, here we are... You go down that ramp there, you're sure to get a ride.

We're going... Damn!  We'll tell the press that there was an accident. Chemical warfare spill. That cover cannot be violated in any way. Understand me, Shermin?

Recognize this?

Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.

It's real, George.

We'll need a lot of help, George. You could hide an army up here.

Contain it and get back to me.

That's not going to happen, George, unless you get us the help you promised us.

Clarify that.

I don't like it, George...

You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.

We're growing very concerned back here. There's no use pretending otherwise. We're rapidly approaching a 'condition red.' People are beginning to ask difficult questions.

I've never been taken off an assignment in my life. Give me twenty- four hours and I'll have him for you.

Then you're going to have to do it without me.

No deal.

George... Do you hear me, George?

I just retired.

Mrs. Haydn...

I won't let anyone hurt you.

This is Marc Shermin. Where are you, Mrs. Haydn?

Please...

What?

Smile... good?

No gas... car dead.  We need gas. I don't want to get shot for running out of gas.

What?

Gas.

I am husband?

What is...  ...Coke?

I want to try it.

What's the matter?

I will see it next time.

When do you have to be here?

No... The closest...

Say it.

The driver will...

Will you please do it my way? You'll get into trouble if you don't. If anybody talks to you, tell them... I do not speak English.

You want this ticket?

Don't worry. They're not going to hurt you. Come on.  Only show this to the driver. Nobody else. And don't lose it.

Don't be afraid. Do what I told you and you'll be okay.

You thought we were a different planet?!

Yes.

I'd like to hear it. Can you sing something?

The machine gave me two. Should I put one back?

I told you goodbye. Why are you here?

I don't want you to be hurt.

No one's traveling in this weather.

Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.

What?

They are beautiful.

May I have twenty-five cents, please?

What do I do now?

Help me!!

Jesus Christ!! You crazy people...

You sure this is your car?

I don't know where he is.

The five-fifty. We already passed it. But it'll take him way out of his way.

Good... It looks like we might be the welcoming committee, so I think we should try and figure out what we're gonna do if we have to come face to face with this creature.

You get that, Lyman?

Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.

Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?

There's a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then...

To the same woman?

How would you describe the sounds we heard coming out of that thing's helmet?

Some tips.  Don't dart your eyes around.  Don't look in the mirror or you'll ID yourself.  OK?  You got a half hour of tape, so give me some lead-in to the main event.  But don't wait too long, I don't want to be going out for popcorn.  And don't act natural.  Don't act at all. Just forget the thing is on.  Got it?

He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him.  Don't talk to anybody.  You understand?  Not with everything that's going on right now.

You were supposed to go downstairs, baby.

Faith, call me, okay?

You have to go.  I mean it.

You talked to Iris?  When?

That's a good one, coming from you.

Look, baby, I've watched you create yourself out of nothing.  You're like a goddamn cruise missile, targeted on making it.  And you will.

Yeah, for about a month now.  Lenny, just stay away from Tran, okay?  And stay away from me.  Stop trying to rescue me.  Those days are over. I'm a big girl now.  Stop trying to save me, okay, because I don't need saving... Just... give up on me.

Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun.

No.

That's not sayin' much.

You were lucky, Max.

I just hate to see you pining away. It makes me want to vomit, frankly.  Broken hearts are for assholes.

That's right.  He wants to share. Needs an audience.  This is one sick puppy.

Whattya mean?

Jesus.

You just did.

Only he doesn't know about me and Faith.  So I say to myself, if I turn the job down, he just gets somebody else.  And I lose Faith... to coin a phrase.  So to buy time, I do the skank.  I still gotta do something about Tran... I figure it's him or me... but I can't cap him without a chump to take the fall.  And who better than his girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a known criminal... who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times.

So there never was a death squad.

Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip.

Charm.

Jeez, you're pathetic.  Okay, I got a pickup at the St. James.  I'll take you there, you can get a cab.

Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.

Forget her.

Destiny?  You living in a perfume commercial?  She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride.

Blackjack?  I don't understand--

And gives it to you.

No it doesn't.

She said "If they get me".  They. Which means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover, which means somebody whacked her for a reason.

If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.

You better keep a low profile for a while.

This is bad.

Are you out of your fucking mind?!

We got to make another copy of this. Little life insurance.

It was a tough call.

Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch.

Okay, we gotta get over there.  Can you borrow a dress from Cecile or something--

Yeah.  Lenny.  I have.

Mace... you're a girl.

Alright.  We're going up.

Take it to him.

Are we under arrest?

Well...  Get going.  You're still bleeding.

Right.  That explains it.

Hey, isn't that Tran Vo?

Have you had a chance to think about --

Does Koessler know about the Suspect Zero theory?

Welcome back, sir. How was the vacation?

Agent Duncan, there's an interstate issue up on 54, run out there.

Agents Duncan, Mackelway.  Anything new?

Excuse me, a salesman gets done in his car and you call the FBI?

Her name is Karen Sumpter, from near Dell City. Just disappeared a couple weeks back. Vanished.

Agent Mackelway.

Ripped off. By hand, my guess. Perimortal: victim was alive at the time, there's blood on his throat.

Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name.

What did he look like?

You have the photo from the diner?

Don't say that. Don't even think that. The next thing we'll be hearing about "Zorro Killer" in the media -- this hasn't gotten out, has it?

Chuck, hello.  This is Agent Kulok. She has a background in medical forensics.

Sorry to interrupt you, sir, but I thought you'd like to know.

You refused to comply with a direct order.

You feeling okay, Agent Mackelway?

"Murman" was the alter identity of William Heirens, the original "Catch Me Before I Kill Again" killer. Short for "Murder Man." It was the case that got Richard Low and I started in this field.

Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file.

I got a look in Testa's computer. His screen name was "Imelda." Have to give him that, had a sense of humor.

Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?

Miss me, Dave?

Don't you touch him.

You are so fucked up.

Agent Kulok, that boy, as we speak, is in Hawkins' truck, probably still alive, in a dark refrigerated compartment, shivering in just a T- shirt: put yourself in his mind, freezing, terrified, wanting his mother. Put yourself in his mother's place, desperate, imagining the worst is happening as she pleads, back there at the rest stop, for someone, anyone, to listen to her. This is not hypothetical, this is real. It is happening now and you can do something about it.

Thanks for the ride.

None taken.

You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?

That's part of the reason I dropped by. I need to learn this stuff.

People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.

I saw him on a talk show once, talking about these killers like they were his friends. Not the victims, not the families of the victims, he doesn't talk about them. Blood money, that's what it is.  Did he hit on you?

Just routine stuff.

Maybe we should back off a bit.

No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me.

Where are you? Everybody's looking for you.

My watch. He toyed with me. He sent me to Chicago.

Probably. I told him Koessler had ordered the report, kept it secret.

You're assigned, we're assigned, to apprehend Richard Low, not Suspect Zero. I have to tell you, Mack, I'm not comfortable where you're going.

Zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country.

Unlock these cuffs.

Uncuff me. What's wrong with you? Don't you want to save the boy?

Okay, I'll unhook you. No weapon.

Who are you?

Hum a tune and I'll sing to it.

It's my master list of missing persons: men, boys, girls, children over the last ten years. Two hundred and eighty-five names. A pool of possible victims.

If you won't do it for me, do it for your cousin, Nadine, right? The girl in the pink sweater.

Let's talk about Zero.

Yes, sir.

This is a first. You criticized the Deputy Director to his face and you still have a badge? You must have some one-of-a-kind skills.  Why don't you just quit? I mean, you're not going to get promoted, not wearing this jacket.

"MyDick?"

He's a brilliant man. Brilliant enough to catch you.

You want to "profile" me? Find out what makes me "tick"? Write about me, go on a talk show, give me a nickname?

Ever since I've known you.

Moving here from New York was much more of an adjustment than this.

Are you calling Her?

Do you realize that I've been waiting for that call for six months and I cut her off?

I'm sorry?

You like laughing at the misery of others?

Yeah.

Are you sure? Maybe...

Oh, yeah... Boy, that must've been a while ago.

Probably a little longer than that, but, whatever.

I'm Mike.

My reputation seems to have preceded me.

...so I thought, what the hell, they make movies in L.A., not in Michigan, so I moved here.

I thought I was going to die.

How?

Like if I meet a handsome young man and I wanted to ask him to dance? I can do that?

...and boy does it hurt when they ask.

...I heard it took four days to light for that shot...

Lisa works at the MGM Grand...

The poor thing. Six years?

A couple of high rollers like you?

Wait here, I'll get you that martini.

Do you ever perform out here? I'd love to see you.

Why not?

Already? You poor thing. It won't last.

It's a rebound.

Can I check my messages? I have a calling card.

Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?

Yeah, hold on.

Yeah.

You know, us.

Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon... Listen, can I call you right back? I gotta take this call...

I really want to catch up with you, but I've gotta take this call. They're holding. I'll talk with you when you get back in town. Bye.

Well that sucks.

Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her.

There's just something about being "Goofy". Any other Disney character would be fine. There's just this stigma associated with the character.

I didn't mention her once today.

The only reason I mentioned her at all is to say that I'm not going to talk about her anymore. I thought you'd appreciate that.

How many strokes?

Oh.  Where is this place?

Him?

I got to at least try once.

I'm going in. Will you be my wing- man?

How am I doing well? I host an open mike and I played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie. Big fuckin' deal. I'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians. How good am I doing?

See, it's all how you look at it. If your life sucks, then mine is God awful. I mean, I moved out here partially because I saw how well you were doing. You got in the union, you got an agent. I thought if you could make it, maybe I could too...

Pause it. 

How's it going for you two?

She was cute.

Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 

Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 

Hi. This is Nikki. Leaves a message. 

Excuse me. We're in a bit of a hurry.

I can't lose more than a hundred.

Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.

Vegas.

Wake up, baby.

That's not cool.

You're gonna screw up our plan.

I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe.

I don't know...

That was so fuckin' money. It was like that "Jedi mind" shit.

Whatever.

Oh... a Dorothy.

No!

No, man. I need to use the phone.

I gotta use the phone.

Sorry about interrupting...

Christy was nice...

She didn't like me, anyway.

I don't think so.

Yeah, a good friend.

I just don't think she liked me in that way.

Selling scrap metal.

...the Copa, in New York...

I'm sorry.

Was I money?

We got the digits, baby.

How long do I wait to call?

Tomorrow?

What a surprise...

Is she looking at me, baby?

...but it's worth the risk. True or false: It's worth the risk.

...you're so fuckin mmmoney.

You're money.

...Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious...

Laugh all you want, but if you call to soon you can scare off a nice baby who's ready to party.

You dick.

...Well, then, I guess we don't have to worry about him anymore.

Yes, I understand.  I'm listening.

The Don himself is coming to me tonight?

Be my friend.

You filthy guinea spoiled brat. Clean it up or I'll kick your head in.

Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.

You take care of Paulie?

He's going to be our lawyer in Vegas.  Nobody goes to him with any other business as of now, this minute.  No reflection on Tom; that's the way I want it.  Besides, if I ever need any advice, who's a better Consigliere than my father.

Outside.

I'll think about it.

My business is heroin, I have poppy fields, laboratories in Narseilles and Sicily, ready to go into production.  My importing methods are as safe as these things can be, about five per cent loss.  The risk is nothing, the profits enormous.

Thirty per cent.  In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up.

No...how a man makes his living is none of my business.  But this proposition of yours is too risky. All the people in my family lived well the last ten years, I won't risk that out of greed.

I kept trying to call you after my divorce and Tom always said you were busy.  When I got the Wedding invitation I knew you weren't sore at me anymore, Godfather.

All right, Hollywood...Now tell me about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta who won't let you work.

I'm sure it's the most generous gift today.

This morning.

When does my daughter leave with her bridegroom?

You mean Tattaglia.

What miracles you do for strangers.

Have you thought about a wife?  A family?

You are like me, we refuse to be fools, to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men.  I hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over.  That was my misfortune.  That was your misfortune.  I was hunted on the streets of Corleone when I was twelve years old because of who my father was.  I had no choice.

I see you have your Luca Brasi.

Your wife and children...you're happy with them?

Is that why there are more men on the walls?

Hey, beautiful girls!

You had better bring a few bottles home with you, my friend; you'll need help sleeping tonight. 

Who are those girls?

What about that Tattaglias?  What will they do about Bruno?

We should hear what they have to say.

Jesus, I don't know...

The Don was slipping; in the old days I could never have gotten to him.  Now he's dead, nothing can bring him back.  Talk to Sonny, talk to the Caporegimes, Clemenza and Tessio...it's good business.

He never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first. Understood?

What about McCluskey?

Christ, Tom; I needed more time with him.  I really needed him.

They're talking to themselves.

Why do they bother him on a day like this?

My Father sent Luca Brasi after them.  He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off...

Then the legs at the knees...

Then Luca turned to the other man...

Michael?

I LOVE YOU.

I can't...

Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?

Your sister wants to ask you something.

Why are you so cold to her and Carlo?  They live with us on the Mall now, but you never get close to them.

You cannot stay here...I'm sorry.

All right, Mikey...who do we have to hit, Clemenza or Paulie?

Is it going to be all-out war, like last time?

That's not how Pop would have played it.

Where are you going?

Send some bodyguards.

Why don't you stop living like a bum and get this place cleaned up.

O.K.  How long do you think before I can come back?

I'm glad you came, Mike.  I hope we can straighten everything out.  All this is terrible, it's not the way I wanted things to happen at all. It should never have happened.

Barzini wants to arrange a meeting. Says we can straighten any of our problems out.

Mike, good to see you.  Got everything you want?

The chef cooked for you special; the dancers will kick your tongue out and you credit is good!  Draw chips for all these people so they can play on the house.

I think so.  Detective squad?

How do you do.

Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late, I'm a swine.

Fausto and I -- we took the boat out, we were fishing, and then it was dawn and we'd caught absolutely nothing.

What? What?

Shut up.

I hope it wasn't cheap.

If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom and I are running off together.

You like jazz!

Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat --

Good afternoon!

Could we sail to Venice?

I have to go to Venice.

I could fuck this icebox I love it so much.  What were you actually doing in New York?

The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating.  Cold beer. Thank you Dad.

What does he say?

Freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd. Come if you want but I thought you wanted to see the Forum...?

What about Venice? Can we stick to that plan at least?

I'm suddenly quite happy to be going back.

Why are you asking all of a sudden?

No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained all of that.

Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley.

I guess.

You should watch that!

Mr Greenleaf.

I'm well, thank you.

Yes it is.

Marge has been telling us about the rings.

This theory, the letter he left for you, the Police think that's a clear indication he was planning on doing something... to himself.

I have to find a birthday present for Frances. Perhaps you can help me?

You really should go in, it's marvelous.

The thing with Dickie -- it's like the sun shines on you and it's glorious, then he forgets you and it's very very cold.

Is he really not here?

Did he kill Freddie?

I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face?

Hello Peter, so good to see you.

I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.

What?

The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue.

I don't -- is that by the Spanish Steps?

Dickie, my God!

Of course. Aunt Joan.

Ditto.

And tomorrow?

Peter, I'm really sorry to put you through this. I just couldn't face going to the police by myself when my Italian's so rotten.

Welcome to Venice. This place reeks, doesn't it? Can you smell it? Ugh. Sorry. Not the best way to spend your first day.

That's good, isn't it?

No.

But you're still tormented, you must be, you've killed somebody...

Ask me what I want to change about this moment.

Plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?

Really, why?  Sorry, I'm completely lost.

It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did Signor Miles leave yesterday?

Senta. We have to ask you to stay in Rome.

Yes, exactly, but his first, his first conclusion was that Signor Miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening.

Yes, sure, we did go to San Remo. That was months ago.

I don't remember the exact date.

It is a little coarse, yes.

Some of these guns are like toys, but a Smith and Wesson, man, you can hit somebody over the head with it and it will still come back dead on. Nothing beats quality.  You interested in an automatic?

You in Nam? Can't help but notice your jacket?

If you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something.

Well, we're all working tonight.

You didn't have to spend your money -- ?

But this is a porno movie.

But... Betsy...

What about the record?

Hello, Travis.

I see where Palantine got the nomination.

First push the man, then the issue. Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man.

Oh, Tom, please.

Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,

Just what?

Maybe if you'd try thinking once in a while, you'd get somewhere.

Sure we could run him. You realize he's already head of his block association.

No, why?

He's Black, OK?

No, this is young -- well, I'm never sure how old Black people are -- but, anyway, he isn't old. That's for sure.

That's fine.

She stayed in the cab, what's she gonna do? But she stiffed me. A real skunk.

Huh?

I have.

Hello.

What's your name?

That ain't much of a name.

Why? Who are you?

I don't remember.

Can't you listen to me? Don't you want to get out of here?

Do they drug you?

Listen...

Well, I tried.

Well, you want to or not?

Where?

He never killed nobody. He's a Libra.

Rock music died in 1970, that's what I think. Before that it was fantastic. I can tell you that. Everybody was crashing, hanging out at the Fillmore. Me and my girlfriend Ann used to go up the fire escape, you know? It was unbelievable. Rock Stars everywhere. That Airplane -- that's my group, man. All Libras. But now everybody's split or got sick or busted. I think I'll move to one of those communes in Vermont, you know? That's where all the smart ones went. I stayed here.

Why don't you come to a commune with me?

Why not?

What should I do? Call the cops?

You don't have to.

Why should it be grounded?

Nice talking to you, Travis.

Clean. Real clean.  As clean as my conscience.

Some. Here and there.

No, I want long shifts.

Are you a Secret Service Man?

Is that so?

Get it.

Sometimes it gets so I just don't know what I'm gonna do. I get some real crazy ideas, you know? Just go out and do somethin.

Don't worry, Killer. You'll be all right.  I seen enough to know.

Had a close one.

Just come and get me, sir.  I'm tired.

John Mason.  ' Don't be shocked.  I don't have much time.  Please listen carefully  ....

I.don't get it.  You're going to help me?

Limp dick?

What are you doing?

Wait.

God's speed.

This Luke was a pretty good guy, wasn't he?

Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke.  I know who I am now, and you don't.  And... I don't like me very much.

But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?

Tell them Pete.  Tell them...

I see you got the telegram.

Do you... remember me?

Then why do I feel like we're still being shadowed?

No... you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before...

You know, everyone's so excited about the Bijou re-opening...

What about a loan?  You could go to the bank...?

When did you start smoking?

My what?

Yes, sir.

Now, I see that you've been running a movie theater in Lawson called "The Bijou," is that also true?

Yet you're contradicting yourself. You earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party-run organization, yet you just said, under oath, that you were not now -- nor ever -- a member of the communist party.

Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?

Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.

Mr. Appleton, you are making light of a legally constituted committee of the United States Congress. Believe you me, you do not want to incur our wrath.

Well, this place sorta reminds me of something.

"It's a Wonderful Life?"

And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.

We've been closed for a while.

Why?

That's Lily.  Your mother, rest her soul.

This is the staff of the Bijou.

"February 10, 1942.  Picture 'Ball of Fire.'"

And you have sixty-eight dollars and thirty-seven cents in the bank. Your only source of income are my veteran's death benefit of forty dollars a month, to which you're no longer entitled since I'm alive, and these ten dollar a month cash deposits you make.  What are those?

I'm here.

Did I what?

I know.  Everyone went home.  We offered them refunds.

Pete.  You think maybe you've had enough?

You tight with J. Edgar Hoover?

Too bad.  He says I'm a communist.

You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer?

Any idea how you got here, son?

Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.

Here, one of mine.

Evening, Luke.

You kids off to the dance?

Here's three months rent, and a ten spot for no more questions and to keep an eye on his place.  Now, I need a moment alone.

So, you're saying that it's true. You went to a meeting of a known communist organization.

Fought?  Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix.

You broke your arm.  You were coming out of a bar.  You were drunk.

Peter, I believe in you.  More to the point, I read your new script... um...

That's the one, "Ashes To Ashes." I think it's great.  But it'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head. You can't work until you're cleared -- and believe me, starting right now, I'm gonna do everything I can to make that happen.

Don't say that.  There is no such thing as a blacklist.  Now, are you gonna play ball?

Lest we forget, Peter, your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than Luke's.

Cigarette?

When'd you quit smoking?

Oh, I see.  But you're not Luke. You're Peter Appleton, the picture writer.

Her name was right there in front of them.  They gave it to me, I didn't give it to them.

Found me.

That's my r-r-rent.

Please, sit.

Pete, there's time before the picture starts, you want to get some popcorn?

What happened?

You hungry, son?

Cathy?

It's a nice drive.  Is that where you met Mitch?

San Francisco.

You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.

Then what was it?

I don't understand.

Is anyone there?

Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.  He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.

Miss Daniels?

They're beautiful! They're just what I wanted! Is there a man and a woman? I can't tell which is which.

Are you coming to my party?

We've got an extra room upstairs and everything.

Mitch? Why are they doing this?  The birds.

Mitch?  Do... do you think they'll be all right? In the trunk? Can they breath?

I wonder if you could help me.

See where I'm pointing?

And the white house?

Where would I get a boat?

Yes.

I need her exact name, you see.

Mrs. Bundy, you don't seem to understand. This young lady says there was an attack on the school.

Young woman cut herself.

You cut yourself outside, Miss?

We don't have any fog this time of year, Mitch.

Are you finished here, Sebastian?

You did say birds?

And certainly pretty.

How long have you known her?

She was selling birds.

She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?

Yes?

Well... well, is everyone all right?

Mother! I'm trying my best!  I'm... trying... my...

I'm not very good at this, Mitch.

Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco, is that right?

No, it's me, Mrs. Brenner. I thought you might like some tea.

Where's Mitch?

Do you think Cathy's all right?

Try not to think of that, Mrs. Brenner.

I'm not this way, you know. Not usually. I don't fuss and fret over my children.  When Frank died...  You see, he knew the children, he really knew them. He had the knack of being able to enter into their world, of becoming a part of them. That's a rare talent.

I miss him.  You know, sometimes I wake up in the morning, and I think 'I have to make Frank's breakfast,' and I... I get up and there's a... a very good reason for getting out of bed until... until, of course, I remember.  I miss talking to him.  Cathy's a child, you know, and Mitch...  ...Mitch has his own life.  I'm glad he stayed here today. I feel safer with him here. 

Yes, I think so. My son is important to me. I want to like any girl he chooses.

I wish I were stronger.  Do you think she's all right? Do you think she's safe at the school?

Well, these birds live in chimneys, you know.

No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.  Did you have a light burning or something.

'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.  Sure is a peculiar thing.

I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?

What's more likely, they got in the room and was just panicked, that's all.

My wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once.

Oh, yeah, yeah.  How old is she now?

Well, if there's anything else I can do, Mitch...

He was killed last night. By birds.

Well, where did he go?

Oh.

I wonder if you could help me.

I think so, sir.  Now then, let me see.

Doesn't what make me...?

Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.

How?

You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...

That was the damndest thing I ever saw.

So you're a lawyer.

Didn't you see the lovebirds?

Annie. Annie Hayworth.

Oh, no you don't!

Can't see a thing.

But you were coming up anyway, remember?

I'm sure.

Why did he shoot her?

I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you.  Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.

Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too?

What did it say?

That might have been good enough in Rome last summer. But it's not good enough now.

On Thursdays I have my meeting and lunch.  I'm chairman of a group that's sending a little Korean boy through school. We plan how to raise funds and... things like that. 

Do you want some mustard with this?

Some cream?

It smelled of the fire.

It all started several months ago with a peasant sparrow up in the hills, a malcontent. He went around telling all the other sparrows that human beings weren't fit to rule this planet, preaching wherever anyone would listen...

I hadn't thought of that.  And then the swifts came.

No, no...

When will they stop?

What time is it?

Mitch, if they hear the car starting... if they see movement...

Can we turn back?

I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call?

The gulls were after your fish, Mr. Sholes. Really, let's be logical about this.

Look, Mitch, even if this is true, even if all the birds...

No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't see any reason for it.

Birds?

I'm leaving! Are you coming?

I didn't mean it that way.  I meant only that I am not in a position to ask favors.

You have his promise, then?

-- pain -- and shock.  She's brave enough, but I don't know about myself.  Now that it seems so close, I wonder if I dare trust my child into any but God's hands. Maybe He knows best.

It's not because of Georgina -- because of Dr. MacFarlane's failure?

You must leave this house.

And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke?

Listen to me, Fettes, I'm one part befuddled with drink, one part over-heels in love with MacFarlane, and one part fey. You're a lowlander, Fettes, and you have no way of knowing what we Highlanders call the second sight.

You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.

There's no standing between a fool and his folly. If you must babble your news to him he's at the Fisherman's Tryst. It's the inn at Pennycuik. You can use MacFarlane's horse and gig to get there. He'll welcome the ride back.

Excuse me, Dr. MacFarlane --

She came again today.  She wanted me to ask you if you would not break your rule and operate.  She feels you are her only hope.

But I -- well, you see, sir, I met Mrs. Marsh and told her.

Every street singer with a cracked voice gives tongue to that one.

I don't know that -- neither do you.  This subject may have been an epileptic -- thrown a fit -- fallen out of bed -- cracked her skull and killed herself -- there is everything explained -- the bruise on her head --

But, I didn't ask him to kill.

I suppose one must pass through this purgatory to the heaven of being a good doctor.

Fettes, the more things are wrong, the more we must act as if everything were right. You must do with Joseph as you did with, the street singer -- complete dissection -- a proper entry in the book --

Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel?  I've had some practice in the art.

What you really want to ask me is about my back, isn't it -- about where it hurts?

I thought this was a school day.

He'll not leave the grave -- not since Wednesday last when we buried the lad.

I will not have you use that name to me.

You know what you want and don't want -- so that's an end of business between us -- but we'll still be friends, Toddy.  I'll be dropping by to see you and Meg once in a while -- for auld lang syne, you know.

This is a gift.

I would make you rich.

Can anyone hear what we say?

No digging Joseph. The churchyards are too well guarded. We will "Burke" them,

I'm sorry, Doctor.  Georgina's a good child -- a brave child -- you saw how she was during the operation -- but if she can't move, she can't move.

You've been with Gray again.

I hate that picture.

Lauren's father's involved. He bought the cops fancy cars, I don't know what else. It's a company called D-E-L-T. I think Lauren found out.

The strip joint?

Think maybe knives do?

What did they give you?

This is where it happened. Right over here.

All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy.

Tommy Leonard. The eyewitness in the Corvis case.

Guy dressed for Halloween?

Because you never accepted that what happened to her was an accident.

An accident, Nathan.

Anything wrong?

But you, you've had them.

If you had a license, I bet I'd have seen it by now. How old are you? Fifteen?

What about the people who are coming to the meeting tonight? Have they all arrived?

In the hands of a mature civilization, these would not be considered weapons of aggression. But in the hands of your people--  We've observed your aggressive tendencies, and we don't trust you with such power.

We want to be sure you don't make -- let us say -- an unfortunate mistake. We know the potentiality of these developments and we are disturbed to find them in the hands of children... You see, we've had atomic energy for five thousand of your years.  We discarded instruments like this many centuries ago.  So long as you were limited to fighting among yourselves -- with your primitive tanks and planes -- we were unconcerned. But soon you will apply atomic energy to space ships -- and then you become a threat to the peace and security of other planets. That, of course, we cannot tolerate.

I wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- or destroy anything.

Can I help you look for the space man? Can I?  I know what he looks like! He's got a square head -- and, three great big eyes!

Did you have a nice day, dear?

Bobby, you've been dreaming again.

Well -- Professor Barnhardt, I guess. He's the greatest scientist in the world.

Sure. Right near where my mother works.

Boy, I'll bet he's strong. I bet he could knock down a whole building.

Gee, I'd like to get inside and see how it works. What do you think makes it go?

Maybe four thousand miles an hour. And outside the Earth's atmosphere a good deal faster.

Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.

Did all these people die in wars?

No -- I'm afraid not.

Go to the movies.

I've got some money. My mother gave me two dollars.

Mrs. Benson -- this is Mr. Brady.

Oh, I'd say forty-five.

How does he explain that?

It's rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor.

I'm sure you recognize from our broad- casts the evil forces that have produced the tension in our world. Surely you would agree--

Our problems are very complex, Mr. Klaatu. You mustn't judge us too harshly.

It was a wonderful day.

Oh, Tom, that was awful.

I've got some terrific news about your friend, Mr. Carpenter.

Important? Of course it's important. The point is we can do something about it.

Everyone seems so-- 

Mr. Carpenter -- this is none of my business, but -- why did that detective come here last night?

Oh -- hello--

I want to know what he told you last night.

What is it you want?

You hold great hope for this meeting.

No, wait a minute -- there's someone else.

No -- no, thanks.

Your name's Carpenter -- that right?  Any identification, Mr. Carpenter? Driver's license -- social security number?

Well, how do I know who you are?

Just passing through Santa Carla?

I don't like horror comics.

Why not?

They wouldn't be out in the daytime.

<u>I'll</u> have to drive!

The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.

Shut up!

Did you see that sucker burn?!

So how do you like those maggots, Michael?

I'm my own man.

Where's Star, David?!

C'mon, Michael.  I want to go.

You can't kill me, Star.

Or a vampire.

I wish they were vampires so I could nuke them in their hearts.

He's not glowing.

He's telling the truth!  Aren't you, Michael?

Lucy, you're the only woman I ever knew didn't improve her situation by getting divorced.

Ouch, my hair...

Grandpa, stop doin' the Indian Walk!

Oh... I was just... having a look at your truck.  What's all that wood in there for?

It's early.  Why do we have to go home?

We are...

-- If there's a girl, we could talk about her.

Wait a minute, kiddo.

Max is coming for dinner, Michael. I'd like you to meet him.

There's only three weeks left of summer, Michael.  Things are going to change around here when school starts.

We're getting close...

Ocean air!

Mom, there's an amusement park right on the beach!

He met a girl.

Not funny, Sam!

Stop it, Sam.  Stop it right now!

Not another word!  I can't believe you're doing this.  I'm going to see Max tonight and you're trying to ruin it for me again.

Ohmygod...

You're cute, Max.

Not impressed, are you?

I don't understand Sam.  He's just not like this.

Something the matter?

Let me tell you something about boys.  They're like weeds.  They grow best when they're ignored.

Hi...

Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?

I'm Michael.

Are you hungry?  Wanna get something to eat?

They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they?

Do I have to do this?

What did <u>you</u> do last night?  You look wasted.

You don't suppose Grandpa's an alien, do you?

What about Nonook?  What have you done to Nanook?!  What have you done to my dog, you asshole?!

That night?

What the hell you looking at me like that for?

Now why'd you go and...

What?

Fuchs...?  No, it's not Fuchs... You must let me back in... I won't harm anyone... I promise...

Don't get near 'em.  The plants! They're alive.  Those things can imitate anything...

Childs!  That a fuse?

Cut that out, Copper.  Nauls?  What's taking you?!

MacReady!

... So it crashes, and this guy, whoever he is, gets thrown out, or walks out, and ends up freezing.

I can get maybe another five or six feet out of it.

What we going to do?!

What are you doing?

We found your clothes -- the ones you tried to burn.

We should have jumped his ass.

I think so.

Anything?

Well, who's got access to it?

Yes, there is.  I'd like to go up.

Goes on like that quite awhile.  What do you gentlemen make of it?

After all this mess then.

How many in their party?

Hey, man...!

Ah... no one... I give it to Copper when he needs it...

Let's rush him.  He's not going to blow us all up.

Sanchez...?  Hey, who...

Sanchez, you and Palmer search the inside...

We've got to find Fuchs.  When we find him -- we kill him.

What if it doesn't come?

You and Nauls got to block off the west side bunks, the mess hall and the kitchen.

Get your gear on.

You know damn well what we both make of it.

We should sleep in shifts.

He's one of them.

It's in between us and them!!  How we going to get back?!

... Thousands and thousands of people.  And sometimes we live in great buildings that reach up five or ten stories.

I had a friend who came here once. Sort of a dare.

... Well, you wanted to see it.

I must say, you look remarkably good.  You don't want a book then?

Sir... have you a name?

Please, we need your help.  The Morlocks have taken --

Send him home.  You don't want him to see it.

So, do we go on?

They raise them like cattle... Feed them until they're ready and then hunt them.

This has to end.

You wouldn't understand.  We genetically engineered the Morlock class to serve our needs.

And centuries later when we tried to emerge into the sun again, we couldn't.  Our adaptation was too successful.  We survived... we endured... for this.

But this is barbaric!  Have you completely lost all sense of --

What?

You took her because she helped me.

If I can only find the right door... the lady or the tiger...

That was a foolish thing to do.

I'm tired of running.

I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk.  VOX registration NY-114.  May I help you?

You promised me flowers.

Talk away, Professor.

Dance with me...

Alex, what is it?

Darling.

Alex...?!

My God...

Now I know you're ill -- passing up the chance to explore some new gadget.

Let them.

... One day he'll be discovered by some future archeologists and they won't know what to make of him. The thick brow, so lacking in imagination.  The dim little eyes, devoid of curiosity.

I don't.  I want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see.

Emma actually likes chalk dust -- says it smells like me.

She made the best Shepherd's pie I ever tasted.

I've been working.

I'm sorry, David.

What happened to Emma will never go away.  It's part of you now and it always will be.  But you have to learn to live with it...

I know that --

It wasn't your fault, Alex.

David... I appreciate your concern, I do.  But I ask you to have faith in me.  Just for a little while longer.  I'm working on something now.  Something... extraordinary.

I'll tell you what... come by for dinner in a week and I'll show you.

That's absurd --

You're up!  You must be feeling better --

How long did you travel?

His curiosity is amazing.

Oh, that explains everything.

How long ago?

I'm going to sit with Kalen.  Keep the fire burning if you can.

Yes!

You share dreams?  That's incredible.

Oh, very much...  ... I used to work somewhere in that direction, I think.  A huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature.

Alexander...?

Yes... After her death, it was intolerable for me here... The future had to be better.

Oh huzzah, the master's home.

Oh, I'm already swooning.

Sir, Mr. Philby is here.

As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering", am I correct?

And roosters.

No, sir --

Well, I guess you'd call us... New Yorkers.

We had another visitor from beyond the valley about four years ago. His name was Moren.  Do you know him?

My father has gone to a better place.

Good morning, Alexander.  Feeling up to some work?

You won't even try?

Yes, sir.

How did you get hurt?

I want to see your home.  Will you take me?

Kalen, it's all right, I'm here --

I don't know what to tell you, sir. He's been gone this whole week.

Well, your condition's pretty serious.

You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct?

I don't give a shit about your patient!

I don't understand...

I didn't put you in Alpine Grove.

I thought you said you never knew your father.

Where? [Beat] It's Becker isn't it? He's doing stuff, isn't he?

Well, Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital. If she was here at the time your father was, then I'm sure she'd be of more help to you.

Jackie, go play in the snow.

Jackie, I'm William Starks. I can prove it.

You can't be William Starks. He's dead.

I looked it up.

I gave you my dog tags.

But no one knew until after...

Do you really believe me?

[Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you?

They're not here.

I don't know. Maybe that's because this whole thing is a dream. How can you have a street with no cars on it?

I've been ok.

And if I didn't want to come?

You should be careful. You could be killed if they found you out here.

You don't understand.

Ok fine. Tell me about it. Tell me about the future. 2004. What does it look like?

What about the world?

Who...who kills me?

I don't know when it'll happen but soon I think, you'll shock the boy and it'll wake him up.

You know how to get there?

Geez, how's that for a fucking "thank you"?

Becker does? Are you sure?

Can you drive?

I only lit it because it was so cold in here. I'm sorry if...

[Beat] Why'd you stop?

Well, good for you.

Hon?

Honey?

Yeah, I could too.  But... I don't know why I'm even asking you this. It's just... we can't place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie. I don't know.  I keep hearing words -- impossible -- inconceivable.  If just one person would say...

That's what everybody says.  Only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night... Could you shoot Eddie in the face?  At point blank range?

That's certainly possible.

Armed robber.

Your name's Harlan?  I got an uncle named Harlan!

Oh shit.

I guess I'm startin' to feel a little better.

You're beautiful.  It's okay.  I won't hurt you.  It's okay.

So J.D., what are you studying in school?

Well, I guess I'd better...

I don't know.  Nowhere.  What are you doin'?

I am the great and powerful Oz...

What?!  Parole officer?  You mean you're a criminal?

What did ya do?

You're a bank robber?

No, I mean how would you do it?  Do you just sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what?

Jimmy!  Hello, stranger.  What in the world are you doin' here?

I am funny.  I'm real funny.

You're in Oklahoma?!

Okay.  I'll call you back.  In an hour.  Don't tell Darryl.

What?

Hey, peaches.

Does it have something to do with another guy?  Are you in love with him?

Will you at least see how it fits?

He already thinks you're out of your mind, Louise, that don't carry much weight with Darryl.  Are you at work?

I don't know.  Warm stuff, I guess. It's the mountains.  I guess it gets cold at night.  I'm just gonna bring everything.

And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.

In case of what?

Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy.  Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.

Whose place is this again?

I've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl.

'Cause I didn't ask him.

Jesus Christ!  Louise, you shot him.

It means shut up, Thelma.

Louise, this young man is on his way back to school and needs a ride, and I thought since...

I'm sorry.  Well, we need the money. Now we have it.

Now you get a grip, Louise!  Just drive us to Goddamn Mexico, will ya!

You think you've found your calling?

So what's the plan, Thelma?  You just gonna stay drunk?

I want you to call Darryl.

That J.D. kid is a little shit.

Just stop talkin' to people, Thelma! Stop bein' so open!  We're fugitives now.  Let's behave that way!

Of all the things in the world that scare you, what's the worst thing that scares you the most?

Before.

Oh, Christ.  I hate this guy.

What?!

I know it's crazy, Louise, but I just feel like I've got a knack for this shit.

Louise... are we still going to Mexico?

Well, I figure if you take a state policeman, shoot up his car, take his gun and lock him in the trunk, it's best to just get on out of the state if you can.

I don't want to see any more beef jerky.  I mean the next beef jerky you hand me is going out the window. It's drivin' me crazy.  The whole car smells like it.

You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?

Oh my God!  Louise!  Look!  Look! See if that's him!

I guess we shoulda made some kinda plan for what to do if we get caught.

Shit!

We probably shoulda filled up the car before we blew up that truck.

They'll probably catch us when we have to stop for gas!

What in the hell is that up there?

Isn't it beautiful?!!

God!  It looks like the Army!

Go.

I'm not apologizing for shit!

Hi!

Oh, Jesus!

Heavy? Heavy?! What I wouldn't give to know what heavy feels like, you insensitive prick.

Did you get my letter, Mare? The one about Ted?

Look at me, Mary. On my mother's soul, on God above, on everything that is holy to me, I did not steal your shoes.

You're leaving it out. Finish your swing.  You're going to like this one -- she's half Asian, half American.

It must be great with a wife like that.

I mean since then.

Well why don't you look her up?

So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?

His mother?

That's it, I'm making an oath. I'll never procrastinate about anything again. Life is too fucking short.

My Mary -- she's not in Japan, she's single, and she's got no rugrats. She does have a little gambling problem, she plays the football cards a bit too much, but she's a babe, a surgeon babe!

No You mean...?

The lazy fuck just didn't bother to look her up.

You are one lucky sonofabitch, you know that?

Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the schmuck out of the water.

Oh God, I'm fucking nervous. I don't know if I'm ready for this, man.

Okay, sounds like you're all set. Just clean the pipes and it's a go.

Think about it: After you've had sex with a girl and the two of you are laying in bed, are you nervous?

Wrong. It's because you ain't got the baby batter in your brain any more. That'll fuck with your head, that stuff will.

The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that.

Dom Wooganowski. Duh.

Bob, do you remember Mary?

Here, just have one of these then.

So where the hell are you, Healy?

Here. Spend it on your trip to Katmandu.

Don't you want to know my name?

Are you... an architect?

That's what I said, so I went out and got him a leash you know, one of those clothesline runners for the backyard. He's got plenty of room out there to dig. The kid's really blossomed. Now I can take him to ball games, movies -- you know, happy stuff.

No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr hated it.

I don't buy it.

She's blackmailing you, right?

You want her dead, don't you?

I've got some very, very good news for you, my friend.

Mary's a little chubby, huh?

Thanks, Healy. Good work.

Look, uh, I've been thinking about everything you told me.

Well I think you're right, I should look her up.

All the same, I still want to call her. I know it sounds crazy -- Mary sure has a lot of troubles in her life -- but, I don't know, maybe I can help her out.  The poor thing's had it tough -- she's in a wheelchair for Godsakes.

Yeah well fuck you! You just can't stand the fact that it was my turn.

Well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water. Jesus Christ, just because she found out about you, why'd you have to take me down with you?

Are you telling me you didn't send Mary a letter outlining our deal?

Pleasure to meet you, Patrick.

Really? But he's been married for twenty years -- they've got six kids.

Have you been to  Let's see -- Santiago, Chile?

You know, I really should take your card.

Okay, Pat, take it easy -- don't do anything stupid.

That stalker Ted got to you, right? You're working for him, aren't you, you little shit?

Ho-ly shit.

Like I'm going to try to figure out a guy who's idea of courting is blowing farts in the chick's face

Oh... Sully.

I'd go with the seven.

I can live with those reflections.

Have you been up all night again?

So who's the lucky guy?

What's he like?

Don't bet on it. Last time I had a pap smear the guy needed leather gloves and an oyster shucker.

Holy shit...

What's up, Doc?

Magda's right, I'm so lucky to have you in my life.

So who you taking to the prom?

The prom -- you going?

'Cause I thought maybe you and I could go if you weren't already taking someone.

I'm sorry. I should've told you, he's got a thing about his ears.

You asshole, what are you --  Mary! Is that you?

Oh my God... Ted.  What are you...? I can't believe this. I haven't seen you since --

I'm kidding. I'd really love to, Ted, but the thing is I already have plans. How about tomorrow night?

What's that?

...and then it was all over.  We haven't spoken since.

Yeah... almost.  You want to come up and watch Sportscenter?

Ted... you're not that far ahead.

Go!

Yeah? What do you want?

It.

Is it the frank or the beans?

One guess.

Ho there.

Now I've seen it all. What the hell were you thinking?

It's no big deal, whatever I mean, if you want.

We're here, Warren. You wanna get off?

See you, Warren.

Which is exactly what they appear to be preparing to do, Mr. President. We're tracking 26 ships inbound to Cuba. There's no sign they're changing course. The closest ships, the Gagarin and the Kimovsk, will make the quarantine line by this time tomorrow.

Yes, Captain, you may proceed. Clear your guns.

I believe the President made it clear that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission.

Jesus Christ, guys. What the hell's Khruschev thinking?

He's right, Jack. Taylor is saying we may have some time. We've got to use it.

We have to pull him. He's not going to be able to handle the Soviets in front of the U.N. Zorin will eat him alive.

How does a guy get a rep like that?

What happened to speak when spoken to?

Adlai can handle Zorin. He knows the inning and the score.

Where've you been? We've been trying to find you all morning.

We gave so much to get here. I don't know. Sometimes I think what the hell did we do it for?

Slow down. Smell that?

You gotta stop 'em. We know it's Jack and Bobby's idea -- they leaked it to Lippman. The military guys are going ape, and they're not alone.

The sun came up today.

That is correct.

-- I have the authority. I am the commander-in-chief of the United States, and I say when we go to war!

Then we have no choice.  General, issue the warning orders to our forces. They will be prepared to execute the air strikes Monday morning and the follow-on invasion according to the schedule thereafter. I'll need the official release orders on my desk Sunday night.

Don't forget, Mrs. Higgins wants to talk to you this afternoon about Kevin. You need to do something about this.

How's my favorite President?

Pretending there isn't a problem won't fix it. He can clear the air on Anglo American relations.

I'm not calling and canceling on Daly. You call and cancel on Daly.

All right. 'Cause you get armed boarders climbing into Soviet ships, shots being fired across bows...

I don't want to listen to this again.

It's a goddman trial balloon. Trial is the operative word, here.

Jesus Christ, O'Donnell, you're the one saying we need to move forward on a political solution.

Hello?

My specialists are in agreement: this morning's letter is not Khruschev. Last night's letter was.  The evidence supports only one conclusion: there has been a coup, and Khruschev was replaced overnight.

It's transparent. The press'll be all over it.

Yeah.

Mr. Clear Moon.

Interesting bloodline you have, Ray.  French, Scots-Irish, Italian, ...and one-eighth American Indian.

Somebody must be doing something somewhere in your jurisdiction, Officer Crow Foot.

South Dakota...  Did I do something unsatisfactory, Sir?

Six rounds. 357.

I did.

Maisy Blue Legs place?

I got one up on ya.

Meet me at base. Over.

What'd she say?

Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van --

Bastards...

Jesus, you alright?

You ever put your hands on me again and you'll be doing the books for a baitshop in the fucking Everglades, Mister.

No, this is the home of the Oglala Sioux and I want the dog-fucker who killed Leo. Whether you get him or I get him, I just want him. Shit's been goin' on too long.

You're an easy man to track, Ray. Ya walk like a penguin with a hard-on.

Grandpa Samuel Reaches. Heavy duty medicine.

Don't be mad. That was just an old traditional gesture that means hello, how are you.

That's not solid.

Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing.

Five-hundred year old turtleshell rattle...

Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man? Who are you?

I'm a full-blood Oglala.

Jesus. Oil?

That's what we're doing here. National interest. National security. Only this time it's not gold. It's uranium.

This Clear Moon's house?

Ray. Ray, don't let go now, Man. Ray...

He's gone.

You're the Indian FBI.

Is that like an hereditary thing, Magdelana, or can one take classes?

You burned an American flag today. And left it for me...

I desecrated it?

X21, give me a 20.

X22. Read.

Remember that upside down flag back at Jimmy's house? Somebody took it down.

Ray...

What ya want?

Washington sent ya. I know that.

What's Tashka Sha, speak English, speak English!

It isn't?

That's a big comfort to me.

It would have been really embarrassing!

You saw a MiG 21?

It's what?

Yes, ma'am.

He was in a 4G Negative dive and you were on his six?

If you were directly above him, how did you see him?

It never came up.

That stuff about the MiG. I was out of line.

I don't mix with the boys. I work here. Let's keep it professional.

Lieutenant...

You turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe.

How about what?

No!

You want to go ballistic?

...they say you're alright.

That's not what I hear.

I'm not good company. I should be alone.

You look way out there. Out past the date line. West becomes East, all things change. You cross the line...today becomes yesterday...or tomorrow, I forget which.

You're crazy.  That's a pretty silly game.

Looks like a tie.

Well?

One SIXTH the speed of sound!

Tomcats?

I'LL LOCK ON THEM, COUGAR.  Gotcha covered, don't nobody move.

Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in my straps!

I'm pulling up.

What are you doing?

Bandit at seven o'clock low--solo. Take him. Pull on the goddamn stick, man!

Don't WORRY!!!?   You've GOT it!!? Are you CRAZY?

I know!

5000 feet. Speed two hundred.

3,000 feet.  We gotta go, man. 3,000 feet, we gotta go!

Is it you?

You're not supposed to...

Well, it doesn't just happen, you gotta do something famous.

Slider -- they let you into Top Gun? If you're among the best in the Navy, I tremble for the security of this country.

Hey Mav, this is Sally. She doesn't believe a word I say. Tell her I'm married, will you?

What do these guys think, I made Cougar quit?

Ahhh...A little high on the left, don't you think?

Relationships are a bitch, here. It's hard enough to concentrate ...under the pressure. Having a woman here is asking for it.

I'm pinned to the panel.

She's kinky for flight suits--said that she'd never seen so many zippers--played with them all night. The noise alone kept me up.

He's the best you have. He's going Top Gun!

No, we...got our butts kicked.

It's kind of ironic. All you guys have women troubles and I don't.

I'VE GOT TWO MORE BOGEYS COMING IN AT FOUR O'CLOCK HIGH.

ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.

I guess I owe you one.

Need a hint?

Who's the hell is that?

Helping him in.

You won?!!!

Maverick... Where'd you get that call sign?

Twenty years' experience, I couldn't shake you. You may be a great flyer. I mean that.

How do you feel?

We can send you back to your squadron with nothing noted on your record except "CNC" --course not completed, no explanation required. Theoretically, it doesn't hurt your career, but people always wonder about things like that.

Would you take me back? Would they?

What's wrong with this one?

Where's yours?

Tell me something; are all psychics, uh....?

Need a ride?

Shut up and drive!

Never mind.  Wet a towel and wrap it around your head.  That'll muffle the signal.

Nice to have you back with us, Mr. Brubaker.

Would you like the same suite?

You see, Quaid, none of my people could get close to Kuato.  The fucking mutants could always sniff us out.  So Hauser and I sat down and invented you: the perfect mole.

That's what we wanted you to think. The fact is, Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid. It was the only way to fool the psychics.

He wasn't in on it.  You set him off by going to Rekall.

Well, Cohaagen, I have to hand it to you...This is the best mindfuck yet.

The guy's a fucking asshole.

If I wanted him dead, you moron, I wouldn't have dumped him on Earth.

But I thought...

Stop fighting and get out.

Perfect!...Get out of Sector G.  Now. Don't think.  Do it.

I say we throw the switch and see what happens.

Kill him.

Listen to me!  He's been going on and on about Mars.  He's really been there.

I'm listening.

Suppose I do...then what?

Sit down.

On his way.

Yeah.

I don't know.

They sell fake memories.

What are you, my father?

Harry, what the hell is this?

Where is he?

Shit!

That son of a bitch got to be around here somewhere.

I've got a weak signal over there.

Look at this shit.

Would you please repeat the destination?

Is that better?

Let's do it.

Well...What do you say?

I don't know!  It had something to do with Mars.

You call this a paranoid delusion?!

The hell you're not.

I love you.

I'm telling you, Doug, your brain won't know the difference.  Guaranteed, or your money back.

All right.

No options.

Secret agent...How much is that?

They'll be here any minute!  They'll kill you all!

...What?

Hauser?  You're Hauser.

By the way...ever heard of a company names Rekall?

I don't need Kuato for that.

Cohaagen knows it makes air.  But the bastard won't turn it on.

...Who are you?

Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck.  She's getting some kind of strange readings on her things.

You guys all set?

You stupid punk!  You came <u>that</u> close, <u>that</u> close!!

What?  Well, for chrissake, we could have made a stand at our place!  We had food, water...

There's nothing like them in the fossil record, I'm sure...Okay, so they predate the fossil record...  That'd make them a couple of billion years old...and we've just never seen one till now.  Right.

Well, we can take my truck then.

He'll never make it!  They're gonna get him!

We're not going over there, right?

So...now what?

You're really leaving, huh?

How many cows does it take to make a stampede?  Is it like three or more?  Is there a minimum speed?

Handymen, Earl.  We're handymen.

Goddamn jeep trail gets worse every year.

You know, if you wanted, we could take a look at those seismographs for her.

Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours A to Z...

Catch it later, Pham.  Gotta get over to Nestor's.

Reckon he hated Perfection more than us?  You suppose he <u>wanted</u> to kill himself?

Those assholes are supposed to be <u>fixing</u> the goddamn road!  Hey!  Where are you guys?  People gotta use this road, you know! You on a booze break or what?!

Fuck you!

It must've grabbed us.  That's why the truck stalled-out.

Slick as snot and I'm not lying.

What the hell are they?

Hey, Rhonda, you ever heard of <u>any</u>thing like this before?

Pham Van don't get his mitts on <u>this</u> for no measly fifteen bucks!

Here's the plan: we'll get a...a flatbed, I guess, with a big winch, figure a five ton anyway.

We'll take your word for it.

I don't know.  If this one's any faster than that other one...

Don't he have a home to go to?

How the hell long it take <u>you</u> to change a tire?

Well...that's it.  We're not getting off this rock...

Forget it.  I got vegetables coming out my ears.  Usually the varmints eat up half my crop, but lately I ain't so much as <u>seen</u> a gopher or a jack-rabbit nowheres.

We're here, Val.  Just tell us what you need.  Come back.

I'm dead.  Let's finish in the morning.

Well, what's wrong with it?

I don't believe this.  The phone is out!  Pham, your phone is out!

Well, I'm supposed monitor these seismographs.  You know, they measure vibrations...

You're fishing. You don't know shit.

Forensic ballistics isn't an exact science, is it?

Your Honor, that's not fair -- !

-- Then you don't wish to call any witnesses, Mr. Dowd?

Exactly what information led you to arrest my client just two-and-a-half hours after the shooting took place?

We have a full caseload, Rog.

...through use of informants, eavesdropping, unreasonable search and seizure...!

Ten years is a long time.

Kim got busted at 19 for burglary. At 20 he was convicted in the shooting death of a young Chinese gang lord... The prosecution claimed Kim did it to get into "the Joe Boys"?

Do you have to do that?

So an upstanding member of the Aryan Warriors wouldn't paint them on. They take those teardrops seriously -- they're badges of courage, of honor. Only their most vicious killer elite get to wear them...!

-- Eddie...

I think he hired Shu to kill Jimmy Chin... It wasn't a Chinatown gang hit -- Jimmy Chin and Art's wife were lovers! She just about told me...!

Do you speak Cantonese, Mandarin, or both?

Murder witness.

Eddie... A guilty client's not the end of the world...

Eddie... go home. Get some sleep.

I need sleep. Some of us are mere mortals.

Racist asshole came at me.

-- About what?

What went down?

Are you willing to testify that the man you saw shoot Jimmy Chin was not the man the cops arrested?

Did the police make any attempt to phone you, to follow up?

I'd l-like to answer the question.

Edward T. Dowd.

Back in the Seventies I spent years putting away gangsters in a Colombian syndicate called "the Ochoa". These guys are very dangerous, Ed. When I hear that a small-time dope lawyer is conniving to spring one of these guys, I see red.

I see: He'd walk out next month.

We reconvict, your man's looking at 25 years on two counts, served consecutively. So what I'd like to ask, Ed, is: Are you joking?

I'll prosecute anyone who fucks up. If that makes me look racist, it's a trade-off I'll live with, Ed.

Isn't it unusual for a man who's just committed a murder in plain sight to bring the weapon back to his apartment?

To the best of your recollection, were you sober when you performed the tests?

The witness is recalcitrant, your Honor -- I had to personally make a body attachment this morning -- it took two Marshalls to drag him here!

...And you were at the trial to... to see that justice was done?

Yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, Cooper?

SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO DONNA?

Where were you for the last hour? I've been lookin' for you?

This isn't Mike.  Is this Mike?

Babe, I'm on my way out to the woods to divvy up the product. Put this cash in your safety deposit box...  It's ten thousand dollars.

It's 4:30. We close at five.

What the hell is that thing doing out there? You're not taking that body anywhere.

What was here, Mr. Rodd?

Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle?

Is there a golf course around here?

OK, Gordon.

No.

No.

Oh, the uncle is missing.

So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.

A blue rose.

Why couldn't he have just told you all these things?

Yes, it is good.  What do you think is in these other drawers?

Maybe, later we could take a look.

Crushed skull. Probable cause repeated blows to the back of the head with an obtuse angled blunt object. Subject looks to be between 16 and 18 years of age.

What is it?

Take a look at this.

My guess is there isn't enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring, but we should do a blowup of this anyway.

Noooo...

Are you going to see James tonight?

Oh god, Laura.

Do you want to talk?

I'm in a mess today, too.  I'm thinking about doing it with Mike. What do you think?

If I had a nickel for every cigarette your mom smoked, I'd be dead.

Laura, I am your friend.

You're not mad at me?

You missed somethin', Ed.

My secret diary. There are pages missing.

Bob.

Laura, you didn't come and see me today.

Laura, you have to deal with all of this.

Baby, you know why? Cause it'll never get here.

Right on time, baby.

Laura, do you love me?

You're on somethin' again, aren't you?

This afternoon?

What do you mean?

Bobby killed a guy.

No.

Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.

Where's Dad?

Hi, honey, how's Donna?

Let me see.

No.

DON'T MAKE ME DO IT.

Hello, Laura. Hello Sarah. Where's my axe?  "I'm hungry".

Did you get this from your lover?

Bobby didn't give you this?

Come back as soon as you can.

And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?

Four cases in three years...

If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?

I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?

This is going to drive the ante up.

They lied.

Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.

Orthopedics?

Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?

How is that?

What book is that?

How old are you?

Objection!

Objection! This is ri... expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...

Whatever the 'truth' is, let's hear that. You were her doctor.

Answer affirmatively. Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't 'part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist. Isn't that right?

You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby. Were you not?

Anything special about the case?

It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat. Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby... Ms. Nevins...

She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...

...to save her and to save the baby. Is that...

Please sit down. I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here. I've got a case coming in two days in the Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers.

...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...

What is this going to cost?

Cardiac arrest. During delivery her heart stopped. When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen. You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.

Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance... she...

'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.' General textbook on the subject. Is that correct?

I appreciate -- a man as busy as --

They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much...

I'm sorry...?

Thank you...

Uh, why, why are you doing this?

Hi.

Kathy Price...

You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...

Yes.

D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?

What did she say?

A single hour.

I had a witness disappear on me.

Sustained. Yes. The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.

I object, your Honor...

The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth? You want another drink?

What happened...?

Do you think it's my fault?

That's not the question. It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault? If I'd... if I'd... I never should have taken it. There was no way that I was going to win.

You told me so. Maybe you'd get some sympathy. You came to the wrong place.

What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...

What are you going to do?

Thank you.

Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...

Mr. Galvin's...

Pardon?

That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...

We have a renew-your-subscription offer...

He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth. He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life. And we can prove that. What we don't know is why. What went on in there? In the O.R. That's what we'd like to know. Something went wrong. And you know what it was. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. What happened? The phone rang... someone got distracted... what?

I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no question of that. It's just a matter of how big...

Who put my client in the hospital for life.

You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...

We just can't do it anymore.  This is our chance to get away.

It's a long road that has no turning.

Come on. Let's get a drink.

...I have to stand up for her...

You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.

Forget it. You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.

Right.

You got a good memory, Franky.

So what?

Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?

She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...

Uh... the admitting nurse...

She didn't do anything. She took the patient's history and signed the charts. 'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'

...four years ago...

What the hell are you doing here?

I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association.  The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago.  She wanted to move to Boston.  How badly did she hurt us, Joe?

I just saw her.

...there are notations every thirty seconds...

But those notations stop...  ...Four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...

Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.  And they resume seven minutes...

What happened in those three minutes...?

Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?

...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.  Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.

Looks almost cold now, don't it?

It's no meteor, that's for sure!

Hey, how about that!

Mister Secretary - if they link up with those others near Fresno...

Hey, you!  Better get outa here!

Did you see it come down?

What's that fellow over there trying to do - dig it out?

Good to see you, General.  This is Pastor Collins, director of Civil Defense.  Sheriff Bogany, head of the local forces ... Miss Van Buren.

You'll hit something!  Can't you go higher?

No, on the campus.  I haven't any family.

We'll get safely out of here, don't worry.

My kid brother has one.  You know why?

What is that gizmo?!

Gratzman! -- Gratzman!  Did you get those biotics?

I got a message for you.  You're the guys from Pacific-Tech, ain't you?

That's right - came down in kinda spurts, didn't it?  You fellers'll have to figure it out.  You're scientists  All I know - they say it's as big as a house and practically red hot.

There's one - there's the other, and we're right between them!

We will, sir!

That probably dropped half way to Pomona!...What do you think?

We're getting this under control. Won't need any more help.  Over.

I think somebody ought to check on it. Over.

I don't know, Bob.  I'm flattered and all, but I've got a kid, now.

I know.  We asked him to keep it kind of surprise until we talked.  Look, how about we get in touch your agent.  You still with Jerry?

Might as well be, Dylan.  State of the art animatronics enhanced with bio- organic grafting.  Bull tendons, nerve bundles from a Doberman, even half the brain of a homicidal primate was...

Anything other than the obvious bothering you?

What if it isn't over?

Just be careful, okay?

Like Freddy.

Any history of epilepsy in your family?

Like what?

Ms. Langenkamp.  I'm afraid there are no evening visiting hours in Intensive Care.

These look quite fresh.

I want my kid out of here now!

You going away?

Tomorrow night.

He's on his way.

Mommy's fine, Dylan.  Just had a bad dream.  What're you doing out of bed?

Dylan, you go back to sleep now.

In my bed.

And...what's the man doing?

Why does God let there be bad things?

Home.

You okay, champ?

You okay?

In what, a romantic comedy?

Must've read about the funeral.  Sick mother.  That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.

Darker.  More...evil?

When do you think it'll be done?

You didn't jump in.

A man, or a boy with a deep, y'know, Freddy voice.

John Saxon.  Do you have any idea what time it is?

Is Chase Porter your husband?

Studio B.

This is still a script we're talking about, right?

Like the Genie in the bottle.

If Freddy's loose, I mean, in your script, where's he going to go?  Another age?  Another form?

Then what is he doing?

I don't know if it has, really.  With the exception of One and Three, I've pretty much kept out of it.  I'm working in television now.  The hours let me spend more time with my husband and little boy.

No, not really.  I...

Sounds good.  Kim, would you get Heather and me a coffee?  How you like it, Hon?

Looks like weather.

What?

So to all you sailors who've fought wind and whale...

Carry on.

It didn't go over 'til I turned her starboard!

Rick March.  Who the hell are you?

Look, meet us out front when you're through.  If they try to take anything away from you like Johnny Quest up there, just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat.

I walked in on my parents one time. It was only like eight o'clock and they were in bed and I thought that was kinda weird so I just walked in.

Ninety-six.

I've been getting ninety-sixes my whole life.  It's what they expect. After all this, I still haven't figured it out.

Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.

I'm just not like you.  Ya know? I'm never going to go to Yale.  I'm never going to be "William".

He does.

God damn it man.  I think he broke my nose!

You weren't there, you don't know what happened.

Passport?

What the hell is going on?

I feel like I got you into this.

That's how he died you know.

My brother.  He fell out of the old beech tree.  Broke his neck.  I was on a camp out.  They started going at it, throwin' things, a real knock down...  They didn't find him 'till the next morning.  They didn't even know why he was up there.

Hold her steady into the wind. Southwest by west.

Ah... Northeast... sir.

You all right?

The Dolphin was a symptom.

Albatross?  Doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.

Your cable said you wouldn't be putting out until mid-October.

Listen to me, you thankless little prick.  We're your parents, so don't you dare talk to me disrespectfully. What the hell is it, this captain? Because I'll see him in a rowboat...

What?!  What's happening?!!

Immortality.

Oh Jesus, oh Jesus.  Man I knew we shouldn't have gone.  I tried to tell you.  I tried to tell you.  You guys made me come!  You made me come!!

How the hell are we gonna get outta here?

Jesus!  What the hell happened to him.

If you've got "a broad" available I'll take her.

What?  Come on...

Damn, Porkchop, you sound just like a guy who ain't never seen a pair.

They tell you that?

It matters to me.

The rust won't wait for you to read Conrad, Goodall.

What do you think?

You gotta be kidding?  He's a human chum line!

You're the one who doesn't care, Phil.

How long you been standing there?

Phil.  What are you doing?

No way Phil.  Not like this.

I don't know.  We gotta get 'im outta here before Skipper sees him like this.

Do you have something to say?

I'm not gonna kill it.

What are you blubbering about?

Are you hating this?!  Are you!

We'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable...

For killing a dolphin.

I used to helm a school ship.  A long time ago.

The families... want your ticket. Turn it in, we forget the whole thing.  Everybody goes home.

The papers are going to eat you alive.  Even if you beat it, you'll never get another commission.  They want someone to be accountable.

If this young man had responded instantly to your command, do you believe the ship might have been spared?

Everybody knows why she went over Tod.  You jibed the boat.

Come in, Montgomery, Alabama.

I'd just soon have a paper bag rather than a plastic one, if it's same to you.

What's Cao Ben?

You know, I really do like a woman with tits like yours that talks tough and acts like she can fuck like a bunny... Can you fuck like that?... You like it like a bunny?... Huh?... Cause baby, I'll fuck you like a real good like a big ol' jack-rabbit bunny... Jump all around in that hole... Bobby Peru doesn't come up for air.

I'm from all over.

Need a hand?

Thought you said this was a private club. How come I'm allowed in without bein' a member?

They look like a bunch of good ol' boys to me. I guess it's oil money, huh?

Wouldn'ta guessed it, that's sure.

I been studyin' a situation over in Lobo, take two men to handle it.

How much money you have between the two a'ya right now?...

I don't particularly care for that kind of talk, Bobby.

Why should it?

You heard from Reggie?

That's right... Could have a bad accident, though... before... durin'... or after a hold-up...

Club Zanzibar.

Hey!!!... Johnnie Farragut. How are you, my man.

That's what I mean... Always looked like you was just knocked out in love... Was real nice to see.

Alright... By all means. Make yourselves at home.

No big buildings like in New Orleans.

Mr. San Pedro Sula's authorized to carry a .45.

My name's George Kovich. Bet you've heard of me.

What happened on the charges?

The Good Witch...

I'm sorry to do this to ya here in front of a crowd, but I want ya to stand up and make a nice apology to my girl.

Only that it's supposed to be a pretty poor sight since the hurricane came through last year.

General Osvaldo Tamarindo y Ramirez. Telefono 666.

You're just jealous of Santos cause he's sweet on me.

Really, Marietta, you got more scenarios swimmin' around in your brain than Carter got pills. Try to take it easy. Go over to Myrtle Beach for a few days.

What?

Johnnie, I can't tell you, honey. Is there anyway we can get on the road tonight? We've got to find them kids.

I'll pack my things and meet you downstairs.

You won't of missed much.

Nothin', honey.  Mama's just actin' strange.

Why we sittin' here, mama?

Gee, Sailor. I'm sorry, honey. I never would have guessed it.

You're perfect for me, too.

You have such a pretty, long neck, like a swan.

Sailor, you are somethin' else, honey... When I was fifteen, Mama told me that pretty soon I'd be startin' to think about sex, and I should talk to her before I did anything about it.

That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little.

So how'd he finally nail you? Right there in the kitchen?

Hell, you just rubbed up against the wrong girl is all.

What you want to watch this trash for? Ain't one of those people have a real thought in their brain.

What's that honey?

I'm sorry, sweetie. I forget some moments where all you been the last two years.

Oh, nothin'. I never let on to mama about Dell bein' the one. I just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was? I didn't tell Dell, neither. He was back home in Chattanooga by then, anyhow, and I didn't see the point. Somethin' terrible happened to him, though. Six months ago.

Too bad we all can't, baby... One thing about Dell?

When he was about seventeen, he startin' losin' his hair.

...That's an awful long way to go, just to get some pussy.

She looked right at me and run her tongue over her lips and put her hand on my arm - told me her name was Irma.

I suppose so. She knew I was bound to see you soon as you was sprung, but I don't figure she counted on us takin' off together like this... I guess this means you're breakin' parole, then?

You ain't gonna begin worryin' about what's bad for you at this hour, are you, sugar? I mean, here you are crossin' state lines with a A-Number One certified murderer.

Okay, manslaughterer who's broke his parole and got in mind nothin' but immoral purposes far's you're concerned.

It's huge. This musta been a grand old place at one time.

Got you a pack of Mores again, huh?

I love it when your eyes get wild, honey. They light up all blue almost and little white parachutes pop out of 'em. Oh, Sailor you're so aware of what goes on with me? I mean, you pay attention. And I swear, you got the sweetest cock. Sometimes it's like it's talkin' to me when you're inside? Like it's got a voice all it's own. You get right on me.

My God,  it better be, darlin', cause it'd be the last... What time is it?

Lula, sometimes I gotta admit, you come up with some weird thoughts...

I really do think it's the best night of my life.

Talkin's good. Long as you got the other? I'm a big believer in talkin', case you ain't noticed.

Let's get outta here... I suddenly got a funny feelin' about this place. Feelin' all that voodoo...

Who do?

Never mind where... Get outta here... I mean it, Sailor.

You think he saw us?

I wouldn't mind a little night life. How about you?

You ready for this?

I'll be damned if I'm leavin'. That band is too good?

You notice that woman when we come in? The white woman sittin' by herself?

You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a chance to rest.

What's that, peanut?

I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool...

We'll be alright, peanut, long as we've got room to move.

Oh God, Sailor.

I'm gonna stay here in this room, Sailor. I don't feel so good? This heat makes me tired.

Darlin', I still ain't feelin' so well. I'm goin' to bed.

Buddy and Sparky come by earlier.

Yeah... He was lookin' for you.

Some... Sparky said Red's promised to have him and Buddy out of here by the weekend.

He's a stone fuckin' criminal, honey, and you ain't.

How can you say that, Sailor?

LULA!!!!

In the Ganges near Varanasi to try and reduce human pollution and now plan to put in the crocodiles to devour floatin' corpses dumped by Hindus too poor to pay for cremation.

I'm fine, mama. I just wanted to tell you not to worry.

If you mean Sailor, mama, yes I am.

You're comin' home, precious. Santos' gonna drive us to the San Antonio airport.

Course I am, mama.

Six.

Figure we'll go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Brown's Pig Pickin'.

I'm afraid his car is gone, Mrs. Fortune.

Take care of him?

How would I do that? Send him on a trip - like maybe to Hawaii?

Just tell me what you want.

Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?

Explain it... I told you.

Shoot him? Like with a gun?

Where? In the leg?

Shoot Sailor in the head with a gun... Now I'm beginning to get it... You want me to shoot Sailor in the head with a gun.

You want me to shoot Sailor in the brains with a gun.

Through the forehead?

Wrong! It's much better to blow a hole in the back of the head... right toward the bridge of the nose... Lots and lots of irreparable damage.

Why didn't you send Johnnie Farragut?

You give me your permission to kill Johnnie Farragut.

What?...

By who?

Yeah... But I did... And I told you all about it...

Hey, pal, you don't start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens.

Hey. What are you guys doing here?

Thank you.

Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.

Mm.

It's fine. It's done. Basically. I'm just sort of... tinkering with it.

Left you...? Who? Emily?

He has a book.

So. Is he any good?

Christ, Crabs, what do you expect me to do? The kid's practically in a coma.

You stay there.

Sometimes we have to improvise.

Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know where he lives.

How bad is it for you?

Oh, Christ, don't start on ol' Gran or we'll leave you here.

Is he awake?

Oh! Huh. Exactly how do we do that?

Uh huh. So. We find Vernon, we find the car. We find the car...

Naturally you have copies.

Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those stories.

It's cool, Jeff. Really.

This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500. You driving this car?

Do you think that's why I've been having these...  ...spells?

I've been trying to finish a book...

Look, Mr. Tripp. You have a drug problem, all right? On top of that, you have a bite on your ankle that is severely infected. We pumped you with antibiotics so you'll be fine, but another day or two and you might have lost the foot. As for your spells. I'm guessing they're a result of the anxiety you've been experiencing lately.

Who's got a gun?

Let me get this straight. All that paper that went into the river. That was the only copy?

Boy or girl?

Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.

Sure.

Hello?

...reconcile with Emily.

It's just... for good luck. Some people carry rabbits' feet...

Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent her a room.

Really? That's remarkable.

Go ahead.

They're glass. The buttons.

It's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or... something. It must've cost Dr. Gaskell a lot.

Can I ask you something about her?

Thank you.

I'm okay. I just lost my balance.

But... ?

There is, but it's not that interesting.

Isn't this...?

Seitz Plastics. That's where he met my mom. She was a fry cook in the cafeteria. Before that, she'd been a dancer.

Kinship. And what's here?

It's okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie, Howard, the others -- they're right. My stories are annoying. They go on and on and on, and the longer they go on the more annoying they become, until finally you just want to grab something heavy and --

I remember that. Five or six years ago.

Look, Hannah. When you get him home... make sure he's all right. Before you leave. Okay?

Listen, Hannah. You don't remember where that aunt worked, do you? James' aunt.

Right. Anyway, I was wondering if I could borrow your car. Mine's sort of out of commission.

Easy there.

New?

I'm sure.

Emily left me this morning.

Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter?

Not have it.

Who's gun is that?

Walter's on campus, being the good soldier for WordFest. But he's a basket case. Someone stole Marilyn's jacket last night. And Poe's missing, too.

Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.

I'm kidding. Hello?

Are you limping? Why are you limping?

No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet.

What's he doing out there?

Honestly. Someone stole my car. I parked it right there last night.

He told you.

I lost it all.

I know.

I went and looked at some babies just now.

Did you tell Walter?

That perfume you're wearing, Antonia. It wouldn't happen to be Cristaile, would it?

Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing?

Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. With Terry.

You mean because his career's ruined and all?

That's nice. All we have is a Japanese beetle trap.

What is it, Grady?

No.

No. I guess you're here for the backpack.

Say, Professor Tripp, is all that stuff true about Errol Flynn? How he used to put coke on his dick. To make himself, you know, like, last longer?

What exactly are we doing here, Professor Tripp?

Do you get high, Sam?

And?

Where you stand?

I -- just wanted to see her, I guess -- Emily. And to see you too -- you and Irene. And to let everyone know that, even though it may be difficult to comprehend now, this -- everything that's happening -- it's not forever. It doesn't mean "Goodbye."

I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in here. You haven't seen it, have you?

Don't need to think fast to handle beer.

Foreman now.

Five years.

Hey, is that a school?

I was just thinking of... the noise.

One hundred and twenty feet.

I should go. Your sister worries, and when she worries she yells.

Annette? She's good... tense.

I'm working on it.

Cherry.

Notice the grain. See how deep and rich the red runs?

You're a good man, Walter. Okay, you did some wrong things, but inside you're a good, decent man.

It's crazy out there.  Young girls wearing mini this and mini that. Sometimes when I walk down the street and pass some sexy looking woman, she makes me feel like I'm bothering her. She stares down like she's afraid to look at me. Why she do that? Why can't she look me in the face?

What are you looking at?

You should hear the bird.

I have to go.

I think you do.

I would.

Do you believe in them?

I'll be asking the questions.  Last night, you hear anything unusual? Screams? Shouts?

I didn't say what time the assault occurred.

He I.D.'d the assailant. The description matches you pretty well.

Then I'd say you're a lucky fellow.

But you are taking it?

Robin?

Yes.

But will he... ?

No.

Walter, I'd like you to try something for me.

It was just an idea.

That's right.

Try it.

How's the journal?

But you don't like coming here. Be honest, Walter.

Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch?

Because if you did, I know a therapist named Ryan. I also know a therapist named Chung.

Do you know what "normal" is?

Fuck you, Rosen!

I don't know.

You know that if anything happens, I spend the rest of my life in prison. No parole, no nothing.

Where is she? What is she doing? How old --

How old are you and your sister?

How do you feel about that?

What?

There's something wrong with this picture.

Very weird.

What's weird about that?

You don't hang out with the other guys.

Are you?

Your windows face south. Northern light is the purest. But southern light is very good.

Hey, there.

Why do you want to know?

I never hurt them. Never.

You don't molest little girls anymore, do you?

What was prison like?

I'm sorry, Walter.

Being here, with me.

For men like me. They say most of us end up back... there. I'm saying there are risks... seeing me.

It's a bad idea.

Don't do that.

What's going on?

I heard they were filthy birds.

Doesn't mean you had to marry her.

You done impressing yourself, ace?

How you guys doing?

Deep and slow, big guy.  Deep and slow.  Just breathe easy.

Okay, Jammer.  No problem.  You stay right here. I have to go there to the end... you'll see my lights.  We'll stay in voice contact.  Just hold onto the rope.  Five more minutes.  Okay?

My rig.  I designed the damn thing.

You wimp.  I had a lot riding on this.  They bought you... more like least rented you cheap--

What are you still wearing that for?

So what about "Michael" then... Mr. Brooks Brothers... Mr. BMW.  You still seeing him?

What's the scoop, ace?

You dumb jarhead motherf--

They must've learned how to control water... I mean at a molecular level.  They can plasticize it, polymerize it... whatever.  Put it under intelligent control.

You did okay, back there.  I was fairly impressed.

It's flooding like a son of the bitch.

Hello, Brigman.

We'll take reading as we go.  If the reactor's breached or the warheads have released radioactive debris, we'll back away.  Simple.

Did you find Wilhite?

Come on, man.  What else could it be?

Triple time sounds like a lotta money, Bud.  It ain't.  I'm sorry...

We should be dead.  We didn't decompress.

Look, we've all made chamber runs to this depth. We're checked out.

Figured that out for yourself, did you?

He can't get to the door... I think he's going to try and take him himself.

Fluid breathing system.  We just got them.  We use it if we need to go really deep.

Stand by on the ROV.

He can still make it.

I'd like to find a place where I can get some peace and rest, maybe around here somewhere. I'd like to try...

Anna... Maybe it would be better to wait a while.

You know, I could just as well go without seeing him today.

But how could you say such a thing?

And have you any other truths to tell me?

This looks to me like a good sign. Don't you think so? As far as I'm concerned, anyone who reads the Bible could not have committed an act of impropriety. Why... as a matter of fact, I remember when I was in China, many years ago, I happened to be involved in a similar situation, concerning an English woman, the wife of Ambassador Shafford, a good friend of mine. There, too, we found a Bible... And I said at the time that whatever had happened, that clue alone had definitely ruled out the possibility of... suicide. Why, it was logical, I said, that whoever reads the Bible believes in God and therefore...  No? You don't believe it? Well, as a matter of fact, I was right... The woman was found two days later. It was a case of amnesia.

It's already two hours... What are we going to do?

But how could we...at a time like this when we just... well, let's at least first have a look around the other islands. Could be that something might turn up there.

Say, Claudia, wouldn't you like to climb up with me and take a look over there?

Have you decided?

I think you're very sweet, Corrado.

As far as I'm concerned, I think she's alive... Why, even this morning... that business about the shark... it wasn't at all true.

Nothing but the usual argument... The only thing was -- if I remember correctly -- that she said she had a need to be alone.

But it's so sad. So terribly sad. I'm not used to it, I'm not ready for it... You know... I have never been so upset in my life. Sandro, why don't you help me?

Any news?

Claudia, let's get married?

That's why I asked you...

Sandro ...What's the matter?

Did the hotel manager speak to you about that place nearby?

I'm too sleepy.

But where did you finally end up?

What happened?

Looks like the weather is changing.

Claudia, I know how you feel, but there are already two of us staying...

And what are we going to do now?

And who is she? Does she work in Catania?

But where did you come from?

And how come you're up so early?

Did you manage to find good rooms?

Yes, but why do you think our readers would be interested in such news now? Even if I sent it, the editors wouldn't print it.

I do, I have to be attractive to God.

God blew up the Hindenburg. He'll blow me up, that's what she said...

I'm not hungry.

I don't know.

We're not in the Middle Ages, Sister.

Then tell me. Where are your sheets?

I just heard you.

Let's talk about something else.

I don't know.

First thing that comes to your mind?

Second thing that comes to your mind.

He's told you?

You've been alone together?

I never saw any baby... I think they made it up.

I don't know.

No. I was sick.

From their heads...

Don't you know?

Would you like to be?

Do you have any children?

Do you know a Marie?

What else did she tell you?

Like what?

It's like hiding from my mother when I was a little girl.

Oh, no place as wonderful as this. Agnes... have you ever thought of leaving the convent for something else?

You have trouble sleeping?

What things?

Do you believe she really saw them?

Why not?  Mmm?

Did you ever want to be a mother yourself?

Is that what she said?

What did you do?

She can't hurt you any more.

How?

Yes?

She tells you you're ugly?

Why?

What?

Are you pretty?

Who am I?

I'm frightened.

Of telling you.

Did you know what was going to come out?

Did you want it to come out?

What made it grow?  Do you know?

Oh don't be, I'm here. It's alright. I want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed.

Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?

You don't like brussel sprouts?

Who?

Why isn't anyone coming?

Alright Agnes... it's alright. One, two three...  It's alright... it's me, Doctor Livingston, it's alright, alright. Thankyou Agnes, thankyou. How do you feel?

So I could go to him.

She'd seen him too.

From the belltower the day she before she died.

Are you frightened?

No...

For what he made me go through.

I hate him.

Mother Miriam was with you wasn't she?

She took the baby in her arms?

H... how?

The longer you take to make a decision, the more difficult it will be for us.

I don't know.

No, no, no...

No!

Why do you call it an investigation? I never have.

And you had a sister who died in the convent.

But what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever Doctor. But it does make all the difference to Agnes.

Who was the father?

Could there have been anyone else?

Well... what do you think?  Is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre... or maybe she's perfectly sane and just a very good liar.

In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book.

No... not in the eyes of the police.

This was before her pregnancy?

Why didn't you take her to a doctor?

Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?

Visitors to the convent.

Do you have a... a diary or a day book?

Oh, Dear God...

The sheets...

Your niece!

No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?

Like keeping her home from school?

Why didn't you?  You knew she was keeping her home from school. You knew she was an alcoholic.

Why didn't you do anything to stop her?

We'll see about that.

What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?

My sister died in a convent. And it's her voice I hear.  Does my smoking bother you?

Do you think Agnes is still attached to God?

The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?

Don't be ridiculous.

I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?

There's a tunnel out of the crypt into the barn. Did you know about that? There's an answer Mother. That's how she got out.

Because it's murder we're talking about. Aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room.

Did you know she was pregnant?

And you didn't send her to a doctor.

The baby?

You went to the room to help with the birth.

You tied the cord around its neck.

I doubt that's what she'd say.

She can't remember.

Of course, John.

They're yours.

Here, mate, that's my hoop, stop playing with it.

Yeah.

Ginger's mad, he says things all the time and Eddy's good at punching and spitting.

Why aren't you at work?

Boys, you don't know what this means to me. If you hadn't come back it would have been the epilogue or the news in Welsh for life.

That's right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches. I don't go round messing about with your ear-phones, do I?

I'm afraid I don't understand.

Well, not your real opinion, naturally. It'll be written out and you'll learn it.  Can he read?

Get him out of here!!

Aye and we'll have to watch it and all.

Aye, but don't rush. None of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff.

Did you look in here?

Oh, listen to teacher's pet.

I don't think that bit's right.

What are we waiting for?

Oh, it's the way you talk.

Oh, I see. You are an actress though, aren't you?

Oh aye, a sledge.

... all this and a jam butty too!!

Have you no natural resources of your own? Have they even robbed you of that?

That's it, parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living!

So you <U>are</U> a man after all.

And what's it all come to in the end?

You're only right.

Ringo, me old scout, they grabbed yer leg for the iron too, did they?

You see.  You know your trouble -- you should have gone West to America. You'd have wound up a Senior Citizen of Boston. As it is you took the wrong turning and what happened, you're a lonely old man from Liverpool.

Oh no, you're not. You've gone too far this time ... and who's paying for all this?

And another thing, where's that old mixer?

Is that yours?

Eh ... pardon me for asking but who's that little old man?

Eh, he's a nice old man, isn't he?

I hope he fell off.

Don't worry, son, we'll get you the best lawyer trading stamps can buy.

Let's go and muck in.

If you're going to have a barney I'll hold your coats.

No.

Let's have you.

Leave him alone, he's got swine fever.

John, I'm talking to you. This final run through is <U>important</U>. Understand? Important.

Oh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're ...

And my nose...

That's what you tell me.

You're a window rattler, son.

It'll only get you into trouble.

Well, look after him. I don't want to find you've lost him.

I've got the stuff. Come here.

Paul's grandfather.

Yeah, down the ... er ...

"The Management of Boyd's takes pleasure in requesting the company of Mr. Richard Starkey, that's you, in their recently refinished gaming rooms. Chemin de Fer. Baccarat, Roulette, and Champagne Buffet." Blimey!

Oh, he's gone to my club, has he?

Eh. I thought you were looking after the old man.

Shove the gentleman jockey in the make-up room or something and keep your eye on him, will you?

If there is some kind of alien intelligence down on that planetoid, it'd be a serious mistake for us to blunder in unequipped.

Do you remember the pyramid?

I got it.  Oh boy.

Dell, I want greater magnification. More surface detail.  I want to see what this place looks like.

Approaching point of origin.  Closing at 20 kilometers, 15 and slowing. Ten.  Five.  Gentlemen, we are directly above the source of the transmission.

I'm sending.  Do you hear me?

Just machinery.

This is Chaz.

Dell, you want to come down, we can figure out where to go from here.

What was that Dell, I lost you, do you read me?

I'm really starving; can we get some food before we go into the freezers?

A transmission?

I have recorded the transmission.

How long to fix?

Well, get started.

Hello, Faust!

Why, what's wrong?

What the hell's going on?

Hurt!  How?

Oh -- God -- oh --

And when will you be ready to do that?

Then why the hell are you sitting around here?

It's really on there tight.

Hey, guess what?

Oh it's okay.  I've had better cag than this, but I've had worse too, if you know what I mean.

So it's trapped in between -- now we have to drive it out.

It makes me sick to see him like that.

We can't go into hypersleep with that thing running around loose.

It's over, Hunter.

I'll do it.  The rest of you continue.

Yes.

We've got six hours left.

I'm getting nowhere.  The whole area around the pyramid is dead to transmission.  I think we should go after them.

Look at that.

... And Broussard got caught in their reproductive cycle.

We can't kill it on board.  It's huge now and must have tremendous amounts of that acid in its body.

What about all the minerals and elements in the cargo hold?  That's the only reason we came out here. We'd have to abandon them all.  We'd be broke.

I think it's going to be almost impossible to drive it up into the lifeboat.

This should do it.

Isn't "bait" the word you used?

Sandy, you want to give us some vision?

Well, we can't go anywhere in this darkness.  How long till dawn?

What'd he say?

It won't come -- it's stuck.

It's stopped?

We're going home.  We're in hyperspace.

I thought I'd find you here.

They're getting pretty close now.

Men have waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent life in the universe.  This is an opportunity which may never come again.

Oh my God.

10% argon, 85% nitrogen, 5% neon... and some trace elements.

Okay, Chaz, I hear you.  I've got you on my board.

Martin?

But?

Find anything we missed?

Still worried?

Thank Christ!  We lost you!  Listen, there's been a new development --

We can't leave him out here, open the door.

We made it!  Damn, we made it!

That's the part that always makes me feel like I'm gonna puke -- when we accelerate into light speed.

These will be very useful.  At least we won't have to go digging around in closets with our bare hands.  All right, here's the battle plan: we're going to break into two teams and start systematically covering the ship.  Whoever finds it first, catches it in the net and ejects it from the nearest airlock.  Clear?

This stuff's deadly -- I hope we know what we're doing.

That next thing there -- six legs, tentacles -- that's the thing we saw in the food locker.

So what do we do?  Do we ignore it and finish loading the explosives into the boat -- or do we flush it out now?

No good... it's eaten too much of me...

Me either.  I tell you, I used to be with a mining outfit on Callisto, and when something like that hits... believe me, you know about it.

Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing.

It's a rhino.

Nice howitzer you've got there.

Cassie, thank Christ!  We're under attack.

Drains right into the Central Reservoir.

I can't reach her.  Too much signal break-up.

MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones.

If I can get to the chopper, I'll meet you at the rendezvous.  Don't wait for me.

Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?

Whoa, wait a minute...

Still got him?

What?  Where?

Nobody wander off on their own until it's found.  Keep in pairs. Diller, once the first team's done their sweep I want you to go down with Annie to Three-Pump while she replaces it.

That's what we thought.

They've changed their heading again.

They knocked out the external feeds.

What is this?  'Twenty Questions'?

Yeah.  Somebody won.

Think I spoke too soon...

That's the wrong way!

Hello, there. Who are you?

And what is your name?

You're more than modest.

After you change, if you're not busy elsewhere, we can have supper.

Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you-

A fine old theater, the Shubert. Full of tradition, untouched by the earthquake - so sorry - fire... by the way, what was your husband's name?

Hungry?

I confide in you and rely on you more than anyone I've ever known! To say a thing like that now - without any reason - when I need you more than ever...

Aren't you?

Also with the reluctant compliments of Max Fabian.

Addison...

Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?

No, it's not.  It's for this.

Feeling better, my dear?

Tell me this. Do they have auditions for television?

It is senseless to insist that theatrical folk in New York, Hollywood and London are no different from the good people of Des Moines, Chillicothe and Liverpool. By and large, we are concentrated gatherings of neurotics, egomaniacs, emotional misfits, and precocious children-

I was there. An eyewitness.

I distinctly remember striking your name from the guest list. What are you doing here?

You've heard of her great interest in the Theater-

The ladies' - shall we say - lounge?

Miss Caswell got lucky too late. The audition is over.

Naturally enough, your understudy.

Didn't you know?

How... how was Miss Caswell?

It wasn't reading, it was a performance. Brilliant, vivid, something made of music and fire...

Eve was incredibly modest. She insisted that no credit was due her, that Lloyd felt as he did only because she read lines exactly as he had written them.

You've already met.

Right here. A minute ago.

Forty-five minutes from now my plane takes off and how do I find you? Not ready yet, looking like a junk yard-

Only in some ways. You're prettier...

Hi.  My wonderful junk yard. The mystery and dreams you find in a junk yard-

Take care of yourself out there...

Bill... Bill, it's your birthday.

Of course, birthday and welcome home... who'll I ask?

She did...?

Yeah... I will.

I love you too. Good night, darling-

Outside of a beehive, Margo, your behavior would hardly be considered either queenly or motherly!

It's a good thought.

Need any help?

I can't believe you're making this up - it sounds like something out of an old Clyde Fitch play...

I've always denied the legend that you were in 'Our American Cousin' the night Lincoln was shot...

The kid - junior, that is - will be right down. Unless you'd like to take her drink up to her...

Many of your guests have been wondering when they may be permitted to view the body. Where has it been laid out?

It's all over.

I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.

I admit I may have seen better days, but I am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail - like a salted peanut.

It's not nonsense.

I wish it were.

The so-called art of acting is not one for which I have a particularly high regard...

But you may quote me as follows. Quote. Tonight Miss Margo Channing gave a performance in your cockamamie play, the like of which I have never seen before and expect rarely to see again. Unquote.

Never try to outguess Margo.

A cowboy.

Why?

Why what?

Don't run away, Bill.

You hear all kinds of things.

Margo does not play a lunatic, Birdie.

The bed looks like a dead animal act. Which one is sables?

There are some human experiences, Birdie, that do not take place in a vaudeville house - and that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian should understand and respect!  I want to apologize for Birdie's-

I haven't got a union. I'm slave labor.

You don't like Eve, do you?

An answer.

There's some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers. Who'd you call - the William Morris Agency?

Who are you?

What are you doing here?

That's all.

It was for my report.

It's after one now. You won't get home till all hours.

Bill Sampson? He's - he's a director.

There isn't another like you, there couldn't be-

If I only knew how...

You mustn't mind Margo too much, even if I do...

Eve. I'm fond of Margo too. But I know Margo. And every now and then there is nothing I want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants.

We're having lunch with a movie talent scout.

Eve... don't cry.

But the raves about your performance-

You want to play "Cora." You want me to tell Lloyd I think you should play it.

After all you've said... don't you know the part was written for Margo?

She knows enough not to be here.

Congratulations, Eve.

Back to Copacabana. But Eve. Margo, let me tell you about Eve-

I must say you can certainly tell Mr. Sampson's been gone a month.

During your second act scene with your father, Roger Ferraday's supposed to stay way upstage at the arch. He's been coming closer down every night...

You haven't noticed my latest bit of interior decorating...

I've got it.

Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-

I'd like to hear it.

... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on-

Well... there's one indoors now. I've brought her back to see you.

How much time have we?

Do you want it on?

Why should he - and why should you?

This. I can't tell you how sorry I am!

Margo hasn't done badly by it.

We're driving out to the country tomorrow night. Just the four of us. Bill, Margo, you and I...

I just don't want Margo to miss her train. As it is, she'll barely make the theater...

Eve.

She wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone - and didn't dare face Margo...

What with taxes coming up - and since I'm a playwright and not an oil well operator - well, I've been thinking...

If we could cast it properly, that is...

No, I got the idea myself - while she was talking to me...

Well of all-

- well? What happened?

You mean - all this time - she'd done nothing but apologize? What'd you say?

Who is it? What's it all about?

Have you forgotten about Eve? What she is, what she's done?

Honey chili had a point. You know, I can remember plays about women - even from the South - where it never even occurred to them whether they wanted to marry their fathers more than their brothers...

The general atmosphere is very Macbethish. What has or is about to happen?

When you do, let me in on it.

"Cora." She's - still a girl of twenty?

I shall never understand the weird process by which a body with a voice suddenly fancies itself a mind! Just when exactly does an actress decide they're her words she's saying and her thoughts she's expressing?

Yes, sir.

That depends.

Now wait a minute, you're always so touchy about his plays, it isn't the part - it's a great part. And a fine play. But not for me anymore - not a foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady.

Hello..

I placed...?

Let the rest of the world beat their brains out for a buck. It's friends that count. And I got friends.

When's the audition?

Anything to help you out, Max.

Promise.

Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying man.

--it was fine the way it was--

--I have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?--

You heard?  They put us both on the break-in thing. Simons liked the way we worked together.  Listen, I'm sorry I said your story was bullshit.

Forget it, the main thing--  --did you call me a failure?

What do you think he meant, this particular incident? Were there others? How would we find out? You know anyone important?

--what do you think?--

What's that?

See her?  Get anything?

And?--And?--

Were you eyebrow reading?

We never reveal our sources, which is why you can talk to us.

'68.

I  couldn't believe what she told me. Eight cups of coffee worth.

--there had to be a White House overseer--

Goddamnit--

--if we could name the guys got the reports, we'd be ahead again--

--almost every source we've used has been Republican, this guy's a card- carrying Democrat.

--I want you to shut up and listen to me--

What would you have done?

You think we're being set up?--Christ, Deep Throat tells you last night that the letter came from inside the White House and up traipses Marilyn naming names.

I think that's him.

Well, we are trying to ruin his life.

Woodward?

I finally got through to Sloan--it was all a misunderstanding that we had: he would have told the Grand Jury about Haldeman, he was ready to, only nobody on the Grand Jury asked him the goddamn question.

--all that crap, you're putting it in the paper? It's all been denied. You tell your publisher--tell Katie Graham she's gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published. Good Christ! That's the most sickening thing I ever heard.

You want Barker's phone stuff or his money stuff?

I never could figure just who this Dahlberg was.  Think it might be anything?

Sure. Him I liked, he was a very nice person. Secretive too, traveled all over, but a decent man.

I called him from Washington. He's the one who asked me to be here at eleven in the morning.

I'm Carl Bernstein.  My paper sent me out to see if I couldn't persuade you to go on the record.

Listen--we know you're involved in this--we're going to get the story, why not help?

But you know who did.

I'm the one sent you to Toronto, Bernstein--

What's a real denial?

I think.

Hey, easy...

There are too many people watching me--they know I know a lot--

I can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are worried.

Something maybe big.

Ordinarily, though, what was the procedure?

--I'm not your source on that--

--if we wrote a story that said Haldeman controlled the fund?--

I don't think either Metropolitan or National should cover the story.  I don't think we should cover the story, period.

--what do you think?--

Mr. Rafferty was very helpful. Four Cuban-Americans and this other man, James McCord.

What I don't understand is how you got here.

Barker's wife called me at three this morning; her husband apparently had told her to call if he hadn't called her by then.

Are you implying you don't believe me?

--this should take only a minute, Mr. Dahlberg, but we're doing a follow- up on the break-in--  --and I was kind of curious about your check.

Yes, sir.

That twenty-five thousand dollars is money I collected for Nixon in this year's campaign.

I don't know; I really don't. The last time I saw it was when I was in Washington. I gave it to the Finance department of the Committee to Re- Elect the President. How it got to that burglar, your guess is as good as mine.

I saw the flag signal--what's up?

You thought I'd help out on specifics?  I'll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all.  Are you guys really working?  How much?

Then there must be something, mustn't there. Look, forget the myths the media's created about the White House-- the truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.

What I know, you'll have to find out on your own.

What?

We know that--and if we were wrong, we're resigning--were we wrong?

Where?

I'm so glad you could come, Mr.--

Are you sure?

When will you be, do you think?-- when are we going to know it all?

And the underground garage one.  Would I know him?

--absolutely--and that's all they do, sit sit sit--every once in a while, they call up a Senator, some reporting--

Where's that cheery face we've come to know and love?

As usual, that keen mind of yours has pegged the situation perfectly.  Except  it wasn't local Democratic Headquarters, it was National Democratic Headquarters--  --and  these weren't just any idiots, these were special idiots, seeing as when they were arrested at 2:30 this morning, they were all wearing business suits and Playtex gloves and were carrying--  --a walkie-talkie, forty rolls of film, cameras, lock picks, pen-sized tear gas guns, plus various bugging devices.  Not to mention over two thousand dollars, mostly in sequenced hundred dollar bills.

I can predict the next words you're gonna say: "anyone but Bernstein."  I want to send a reporter to Miami.

Howard--

--listen, I love this country, you think I want to bring it down?--I'm not some goddamn zany, I was a hawk--

What else have you got?

--no--

The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?

Colson's too smart to get directly involved with something like that.

A boy or a girl?

--and it wasn't Ehrlichman or Colson or the President.

What the hell was that?

Great evening, isn't it?

What did you just say?

Look, Chris.  There are just some things you need to learn, that's all.

Finch, don't you think it's about time you learned to take a dump at school?

Oh no, no date.  Bathroom incident.

Just go!

I'll tell you, I've learned one thing: women, like wine, get better with age.  Of course, I have no frame of reference for this comparison.

Yeah...so like, what else <u>do</u> you do?

Alright, cool.  I gotta hit the showers, but...I think this'll be really good.

Uh...my dad's the manager.

Onions?

Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I really have no idea.

...I've got this lacrosse game.  It's really important, it's our last game. And you know, Central almost beat us last time, so I really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at State, which means that after the game I might be able to stop by...

I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it...

There's something I've been meaning to tell you, Heather.

Hmm.  You know that's  really a shitty middle name!

He likes it.

No you haven't.

No.

No comment.

Well...I guess it's okay for me to tell you now.  That reputation of his isn't going anywhere.  Finch comes to me and says, "Jessica, I need help with this, blah blah, etcetera."  So I told him, pay me two- hundred bucks, and I'll tell a couple girls that you're dynamite in bed.  So he did, and I did.

Give it to me!  Yes!

And you said...

That's what we are, we keep each other on track.  Prior to this day, we've postured.  We've procrastinated. We've pretended.  We've -- well I can't think of other p-words, but we've probably done them too.

Yeah, it's like tradition or something.

I have no idea.  Finch showers in a bathing suit.

Hey, where's Finch?

You can send me the address too.

Hey, minuteman.

What the heck is this?

You're not...busy?

Okay.

I know, Dad.

Yes dad.

Son.  This lady's here for you.

Dad!!

What was your name again?

Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?

So, the end of the story is...you had to kiss the guy for twenty seconds?

This'll do.

She's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.

Is there anything you don't jerk off to?

Ooh, here's an easy one:  "Attractive SWF, fun loving and a youthful mind seeks outgoing companion." Okay..."Attractive"...ugly.

I'll just say that we had a great night together.

It's true.  I mean, after this, everything'll be different.

What's up, fellas?

Well.  You have seen me.  Now it is my turn to see you.  Strip.

No, no, you must put your whole body into it.

Jim...

SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!

Ho-lee shit.

It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.

"Dear Ms. Hughes.  We're sorry, but after keeping you on the wait list for the past couple months, we've decided you are now rejected.  Enclosed is a 100-page, full-color brochure on how rejected you are."

I was being selfish.  And majorly insensitive.  And I'm a total idiot.

You're not doing the extra credit problems.

We've come a long way since Homecoming.

I think you're so right, Kevin.

You sure you're comfortable?

Yeah Vick?

That was a great night.

Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying.

What?

You called me to ask me how to get laid?

Say that again, Kevin?

Hey.  I got another question for you.

Then she said -- she loves me.

Feeling better, Oz?

Dude, it's not like I haven't been trying to get laid.

So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance.

Okay, explain.

Dammit, Kevin, what's with the attitude?

...Guess what?

And by the way, Sherman didn't even get laid.

I guess we'll call you two-ply.

Hah!  Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like your dad works at <u>her</u> store.

I think you need your balls reattached.

Hey, you know, what can I say, I dig those cute little sweaters she wears.

God, I can't believe there are so many cool people at this party.

I mean, if by some miracle you can find the werewolf that bit you, and then manage to eat it's heart, the curse is lifted. I was gonna tell you but Marcel wouldn't let me.

Either way works for us...

Actually, I'm waiting for someone.

God. How can you eat like that?

Ha ha! Yeah right, white boy! Ha Ha ha.  I think maybe I drank too much.

Ahh! Jesus! You're burning hot! What the hell -

Ha-ha!

Serafine Flocquet. I work for your uncle.

You must not have known him very well. He's not like that.

I'm serious. There's nothing for you down there. It's dangerous.

Wait a second, are you like the Steven King of France or something...

So you came after all. Just in time, it's getting interesting.

Andy! Holy shit!

That's what counts. If you're not passionate about it, don't waste your time. That's why I quit college... Plus I'm a lazy bastard.  Wait, I know this... A votre sante.

I don't... I... I can't remember...

Because, Andy. It's a cure.

Andy... I should never have let you go underground. I'm sorry...

I saw him. Just before those bastards zapped him back. The ADM is in the wine cellar, in a bottle of Chateau Margaux.

I hope they fucking fry us all.

No wonder he let her go.

God. I can't believe it.

Hey! You shouldn't be down there!

It's you. You should be dead in that wreck with Bazin and Racine!

Claude...?

Ha. Some wonder drug...

You recognize her?

That's not all...  Marcel - Officer Boulard was following you.

It's horrible. Terrence was one of the most brilliant men I've known.

Psychic awareness. Right.

Not you too -

You're exactly right, Andy. I enlisted both Serafine and your uncle to obtain ADM. And now I'm counting on your assistance too.

Uncle Terrence?

Uncle Terrence, you're...

Fuck you! If I'm gonna kill myself I'll do it when I'm good and ready! You can go to hell!

Shit. I feel sick.

Andy!

Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...

What did she say?

Saint Severin...

Why were you so late tonight

I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.

Are you running away?

Noooo....

Is everyone all right?

Poor Meetoo!

Fortunately, I am to be married.  With your highness, permission.

AND A SONG SOMEONE SINGS ONCE UPON A DECEMBER.

I don't know.  I don't see what this has to do with me.

By pulling my hair?!

I'm going to stretch my legs

Come on up!

You must enjoy causing me pain!

You never said anything to me about having to prove I'm a Princess!

I'm sorry.

Oh! I'm sorry...

I'm glad you found what you were looking for.

Who are you, child?

Dmitri didn't want the money?

Trust me, it's her!

I'm getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel my forehead...

It's no use, Dmitri - we'll never find the right girl!

Hurry up with those papers.

Wake up, young lady, that's our train.

Well, she certainly has a mind of her own.

See? The Princess is under there ...

The "Odessa Dunk"?

So where will you go?

So. You don't want to go to the coronation, eh?

I need to speak with the Dowager Empress ...

I'm not Ulo and I won't slow down. But you will listen to me!

I sent for you because I owe you a debt of gratitude larger than I can ever repay

You are the boy ...

May I present her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia!

Perhaps you could convince her?

Hey, you on television?

Fellas... you know-Jesus! Come on!

It's an important issue.

Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.

No, it can't be, because he's a comic.

So what are you telling me, you're putting on two comics in a row?

Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?

I'm-I'm-I'm gonna have a stroke.

Stop it, Alvy!

You? You kiddin'?  If the Gestapo would take away your Bloomingdale's charge card, you'd tell 'em everything.

I know, well, it's just that- you know, I mean, I-I-I-I gotta sing tomorrow night, so I have to rest my voice.

If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.

Don't give it to me. Don't!

Oh, God! Here yuh go! Oh, good, now he'll think-  Aaaah! Okay.

It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful... Ooooh, lovely!

He was creepy.

Hi. Hi, hi.

You have a car?  So...  I don't understand why... if you have a car, so then-then wh-why did you say "Do you have a car?"... like you wanted a lift?

No, no thanks. Hey, don't-

Huh?

That's okay, you... we-we can walk to the curb from here.

Yeah, thanks. Thanks a lot. Well...

No, no, that'll be fine. I don't mind. Sure.

Fifteen years?

Why not?

Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. I guess-

God bless.

So, did you do shoot the photographs in there or what?

Oh... nothing. Not-no, no!

I know.

Yeah.

Yeah?

Gimme a kiss.

Yeah, why not, because we're just gonna go home later, right?

And-and uh, there's gonna be all that tension. You know, we never kissed before and I'll never know when to make the right move or anything. So we'll kiss now we'll get it over with and then we'll go eat. Okay?

I'm gonna have a corned beef.

Nothing that a few mega-vitamins couldn't cure.

Yeah?

Yeah?

And blind people, crippled...

I don't-don't know how they get through life. It's amazing to me.

Yeah, he's the Mafia. Linen Supply Business or Cement and Contract, you know what I mean?

You know what I mean? Like the tip o'your nose, and if I stroke your teeth or your kneecaps... you get excited.

That's the key question.

Ye-ah. Was it... It was yours actually, but, uh, I approved it immediately.

You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about.

Then why are you always pushing me to take those college courses like I was dumb or something?

Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?

What are you doing?

Oh, no, Alvy, please. Alvy, please.  M'mrnm.

I don't know, but you seem sort of distant.

Oh, you have my body.

Well, I need grass and so do you.

M'hm.

Yeah.

You followed me!

Do you realize how paranoid you are?

And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother.

Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.

In-in... Alvy, in my dream Frank Sinatra is holding his pillow across my face and I can't breathe.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.

Well, she said that I should probably come five times a week. And you know something? I don't think I mind analysis at all. The only question is, will it change my wife?

She said, "Will it change my wife." You heard that because you were there so I'm not crazy.

Are you okay?  What's the matter?  Are you all right? What-

Oooh.

I told you a thousand times you should always keep, uh, a lotta insect spray. You never know who's gonna crawl over.

Jesus. All right, gimme a magazine. I- 'cause I'm a little tired.  You know, you, you joke with-about me, you make fun of me, but I'm prepared for anything. An emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake. Hey, what is this? What? Did you go to a rock concert?

What is this? What are you, since when do you read the "National Review"? What are you turning in to?

Well, I was in be- It's three o'clock in the morning. You, uh, you got me outta bed, I ran over here, I couldn't get a taxi cab. You said it was an emergency, and I didn't ge- I ran up the stairs. Hell - I was a lot more attractive when the evening began. Look, uh, tell- Whatta you- Are you going with a right-wing rock-and- roll star? Is that possible?

Is he in the bathroom?

Two?

Yeah?

Alvy, let's never break up again. I don't wanna be apart.

Oh, look, look, there's that... that's that's my old house. That's where we used to live.

I'm just not... you know, I don't think I could take a mellow eve- 'cause I-I don't respond well to mellow, you know what I mean, I-I have a tendency to... if I get too mellow, I-I ripen and then rot. You know, and it's-it's not good for my... 

She would not sleep with me the other night, you know, it's-

The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.

God, it's so clean out here.

Whose "Catcher in the Rye" is this?

Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?

Hey, this one's mine, this button. This one, you rem-

I'm so tired of spending evenings making fake insights with people who work for Dysentery.

Alvy, what is so fascinating about a group of pituitary cases trying to stuff the ball through a hoop?

Alvy, don't! You're using sex to express hostility.

Oh, I'm sorry!

Bad?

Tsch, a few.

Charlie Chaplin.

What are you making such a big deal about?  They're only lobsters. Look, you're a grown man, you know how to pick up a lobster.

Ah.

No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient out. Every time some group disagrees with you it's because of anti-Semitism.

I have some very good memories there.

Oh.

You all right?

If she comes over here, Max, my brain is going to turn into guacamole.

Oh, he-he didn't say anything.

So the colored have enough trouble.

All right-so we can afford it.

Oh, I can imagine. P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut.

Look at you, you-you're such a clown.

If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.

Oh, he's adorable, Annie.

It could be freezing, it could be raining.

Tessie, they say you were the sister with personality.

There were many men interested in you?

So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?

So who won?

You're not upset that I brought the dog?

It has your ring.

What's that?

The movie.

What a fucking day!  We only just got a sitter.  I don't know her from fucking Adam.  She could be a serial killer.  I'm going to have to call every ten minutes. You have to let me give out the number.

Oh.

Oh.

I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Well, I'm a little stressed.  And I've been taking pills to get my weight down since the baby.

And the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy.  I've got a ghastly headache, actually.

Would you leave us alone right now?

He's gonna miss his flight.

It's not a contest.

Directing suits you.

In Cheyene Walk?  Lucy's going to have a meltdown.  Oh, I'm so sorry.

Stupid tart.

Oh.  You're them.

It was fifteen seconds.

I suppose.  Sally, that's quite a gift. I'm not sure it's in your best interest.

The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning.  The house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the London flat.

What you earn has to double in order to cover expenses in London, it's an outrageously expensive city.

You only made half your quote this year.

Yes.

I love you.  Most beautiful woman in the world.

I mean, you're really back.

Don't get it.

I'm looking forward to meeting you, too. And Skye, I'm thrilled that you're willing to take this leap with me. Eternally grateful, really.

I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna.

Of course we do.  We have to sign our taxes.

Still champions.

Not properly watered.

Fuck you.

You walked out on a five year marriage.

It's not like this all the time.

Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?

Cal, too?

Don't.

I had an abortion two weeks ago.

I told you when we met I never wanted children.  I don't want kids in my life. We talked about it.  You weren't listening.

Yes.

I can't got tonight.  I don't want to be on a plane on my own tonight.

I don't want to go tonight.

I know.

Coffee?

I love gifts.  What did you guys get us?

Yes.

Don't I find what?

Ours.

You got your DP?

Mmm.  It says something about the two of you maybe.

Oh, yes.  You know Ryan's been sober eight years.  And it's difficult if I... you know.  It's better if I don't.

Well, yes.  Yes, in fact.  A little on the outside, yes.  And there's been all this friction.

The wrong word, maybe.  Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.

What am I, five?

Lemon or raspberry?

Ryan's really angry with me.

Yes.

Oh yes.  Nineteen...just.  I'm cold.

That's very nice.

How do you do, Skye?

Ryan.

I love it here.  Don't you love it here, Ryan?  I love it here.  And I love tonight.  And I love these people.  And this feels utterly fantastic, Ryan.  Utterly fantastic.

Ryan, you've got to come!  You've got to help me find the dog!  I let their dog out.  We need to find the dog.

We have to find the dog, Ryan.

Jesus Christ, it's a fucking dog!

I so wish I'd known.

I'm so sorry.

And I'm overwhelmed.  And I want to do it justice.  And I hope we can spend time together.  And I'm gushing.  It's my worst quality.

Do you need anything else?

I'll tell you who doesn't know, cute girls don't know.

Are you lovesick?

How?

Like the last time.

Like the last time.

Shit!

Shit.  It's my Galiano.

No.  Really.  For real.  Really.

You're my best friend.

Thank you, Panes.

You're keeping a record, are you?

Monica and Ryan.

Oh my God, sorry.  I'm interrupting.

Happy anniversary.  Thank you for making me a part of it.

He's a novelist.

Like Joe.

Well, I don't trust her.  I never have.

You'll hate it in London.  It's wet and miserable.  A medical hellhole Sally. It's socialized.  Beds in the corridors. Terrible plumbing.

You are not having your baby in London. You're going to have your baby at Cedars in Beverly Hills, America, delivered by Dr. Milton Cohen.  Period. And you're getting that epidural right away, don't let anyone talk you into any of that Lamase bullshit.  There's no excuse for pain like that.

Oh Soph, Joe loves kids.  Joe wants kids. Joe thinks he needs kids.

Don't try and change the subject.  Oh God, it feels great!  He's just a little narcissistic, irresponsible and unreliable.

I don't have a drug problem.

Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut.

I don't know what came over me, talking back like that.  I must be going crazy...

You know, you're not just workers -- you can be whatever you want to be! Look at Z!  He started as a worker -- then he became a soldier!

What a bunch of losers.  Mindless zombies capitulating to an oppressive system --

So uh -- how come I haven't seen you around here before?

You're right!

You watch yours, soldier, or my worker friend will beat you up!

You're the hero of the recent termite campaign, aren't you?

And you are...?

Gee, uh, could you say it a little louder, I think there are some ants in the next colony who didn't hear you.

That's not what you said the <u>other</u> <u>night</u> --

I've been kidnapped by the village idiot.

Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!

Worker!  Come back here now!

This lake is huge!  And so close to the colony!  Think of the vacation potential!

And only you can become a Queen?

So what makes you so special?

Come on, Z.

No, no, you're...lookin' good. You've got good color in your cheeks.

Princess Bala, sir.  Your fiancee.

Actually, sir, we're ahead of schedule.  We have thirty-six seconds available right now.

Dammit, this tunnel is priority A-1! We can't afford <u>any delays</u> on this project!

What do we have on this "Insectopia"?

So this Z...he fancies himself an individual?

Not that one.  Or that one.

Lays it on a little thick, doesn't he?  If you ask me, he's one giant bore.

Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.

No -- you -- you don't understand!

Well she better -- she's engaged to one.  <u>Me</u>!

Affirmative.

What's this?  A <u>worker</u> has been masquerading as a war hero?!

Conversation...yes...well...  Wasn't she briefed?

All these parties are so marvellously <u>alike</u>.

Your majesty, I'm afraid matters of state keep me from attending the ceremony.

'Fraid not, your majesty.  Goodbye, your majesty.

...I should?

What do you see out there?

Time to cut a rug, Z!

I'm getting lonely.  Who are you talking to, anyway?

This the place?

So this is your mother's apartment?

Mrs. Dreyfuss, can I borrow some coffee -- and maybe an orange and a couple of eggs?

Beatnik! Go to my kitchen -- third drawer, under the good silver, there is napkins.

Morning, Mr. Baxter.

You're beginning to sound like Mr. Kirkeby already.

No.

Sure.

You mean tonight?

I'm sorry, but I can't tonight. I'm meeting somebody.

Eight-thirty.

All right? That's wonderful! It's the Majestic -- 44th Street.

They got a great little band at El Chico, in the Village -- it's practically around the corner from where you live.

Oh, I even know who you live with -- your sister and brother-in- law -- I know when you were born -- and where -- I know all sorts of things about you.

Well, don't tell the fellows in the office about the appendix. They may get the wrong idea how you found out.  'Bye.

Marry Christmas.

You couldn't help yourself. I mean, when you're having a drink with one man, you can't just suddenly walk out on him because you have another date with another man. You did the only decent thing.

I understand. Christmas -- family and all that --

Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I have quite a bit of influence in Personnel. You know Mr. Sheldrake?

Who?

What's her first name?

When are you coming home?

Oh, you're wrong. He told me --

I am. Let me get the cards.

What do you call it when somebody keeps getting smashed up in automobile accidents?

That's me with men. I've been jinxed from the word go -- first time I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.

I'm sure that's the explanation.

No doubt about it.

Do I have to?

Who was that?

Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish.

There's a call for you --

-- Mr. Sheldrake.

In this house, you're supposed to.

What are you doing with that?

Tennis racquet? Oh, I remember -- I was cooking myself an Italian dinner.  I used it to strain the spaghetti. FRAN  Why not?

You mean to someone like Mr. Sheldrake.

Worse than that -- she was the wife of my best friend -- and I was mad for her. But I knew it was hopeless -- so I decided to end it all. I went to a pawnshop and bought a forty-five automatic and drove up to Eden Park -- do you know Cincinnati?

Here.

Uh-huh. While I was sitting there, trying to make my mind up, a cop stuck his head in the car, because I was illegally parked -- so I started to hide the gun under the seat and it went off -- pow!

Are we dressing for dinner?

We're going to finish that gin game.

How's everything at the apartment?

Oh.

Did you hear what I said, Miss Kubelik? I absolutely adore you.

Good evening, Mr. Baxter.

Oh -- Mrs. Lieberman.

Last night?

Baxter?

What -- what's that got to do with me? I'm not running any bookie joint.

Who?

Where is your apartment?

The reason I called is -- I won't be home for dinner tonight. The branch manager from Kansas City is in town -- I'm taking him to the theatre Music Man, what else? No, don't wait up for me -- 'bye, darling.  Tell me something,  Baxter  -- have you seen Music Man?

I made other plans. You can have both tickets.

You know how people talk.

Well -- I guess so.

So it was.  She threw it at me.

Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you --

Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.

Say, Baxter -- you gave me the wrong key.

What's gotten into you, Baxter?

What's the matter with Miss Kubelik?

You're on your way up, Buddy-boy. And you're practically out of liquor.

I'm a pretty good operator myself -- but she just won't give me a tumble -- date-wise.

A lot of guys around here have tried it -- all kinds of approaches -- no dice.  What is she trying to prove?

So long, Baxter. We know you won't let us down.

Hi, Baxter.

Buddy-boy -- she won't keep that long -- not even on ice.  Listen, kid, I can't pass this up -- she looks like Marilyn Monroe.

Make it thirty minutes.  What do you say, Bud?

It is?  Well, how about that? No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.

Dear Mr. MacIntosh --  Vanderhof, Public Relations. Oh, yes, Baxter. Just a minute.  All right, Miss Finch -- type up what we got so far.  Now what is it, Baxter?

Cancel? But it's her birthday -- I already ordered the cake --

What are you going to do, Doc?

What's her name?

Hello, Miss Kubelik.

She'll sleep on and off for the next twenty-four hours. Of course, she'll have a dandy hangover when she wakes up --

She didn't mean it, Doc -- it was an accident -- she had a little too much to drink and -- she didn't know what she was doing -- there was no suicide note or anything -- believe me, Doc, I'm not thinking about myself --

It's just that she's got a family -- and there's the people in the office -- look, Doc, can't you forget you're a doctor -- let's just say you're here as a neighbor --

Help yourself.

What's this -- you packing?

Sorry to lose you, Baxter.

You know me with girls. Easy come, easy go. Goodbye, Doc.

What about him?

Who is Mickey?

Family?

Where do we go -- my place or yours?

Say, this is Snugsville.

Good night?

Hi, Buddy-boy. What happened to you?

Doctor.

Please -- just let me sleep.

Will you excuse me?

How long has it been -- a month?

I saw my lawyer this morning -- I wanted his advice  -- about the best way to handle it --

I have that date -- remember?

Now, Fran --

A hundred dollars? I wouldn't call that cheap. And you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment --

Don't forget to kill the lights. See you Monday.

Sorry it took me so long on the phone. But we're all set.

But I thought you could hold your tongue.

You bet it won't. I'll arrange for you to get a month's severance pay --  That's right, Miss Olsen. I'm letting you go.

Maybe we should send up two flies -- and see if they'll propagate in orbit.

Where are you headed?

Look -- you know the girls -- Thta's Terri -- she was playmate of --

Look -- the girls could get killed -- we're not supposed to be this close combat, I mean real combat.

You make some of your closest friends in the army -- war has a way of bringing men together.

We've been attacked.

North ?

What unit were you with ?

That's quite an array of ribbons...

It's really too much -- I mean I've collected every picture of her since she was Miss December.

So what happened ?

Holy shit.

Arch light.

What are you doing out here?

I've arranged with those people we saw at Hau Fat to give us some 50 caliber in trade for a couple a drums of fuel --

What do you see?

I know it sounds stupid, but I feel like the goddamn jungle's watching us.

Whatdoya think it thinks.

We could go in tomorrow at dawn -- there's always off-shore wind in the morning.

Yeah, Chef -- go ahead -- take Lance with you --

What're you trying to say, Captain --

I --

What do you want ?

Our Recon flight ?

Do me a favor buddy, please.

It's to everyone I really knew -- the first girl I screwed -- my brother -- best friend -- I wanted to tell 'em how much I enjoyed knowing 'em -- it's been a great twenty years. I gotta let 'em know.

Spooky.

Who is he?

Captain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters, reporting as ordered, sir.

No, sir.

I thought he was a lame.

I don't know. He was a lame, that's all.

Attacks repulsed, as I was saying.  This is only  for this war, Captain. Viet Cong -- 54; North Vietnamese regular forces -- 15; South Vietnamese -- 28 -- regular forces and otherwise.  Americain -- 6. Of course, they were, perhaps, mistakes, Captain.

Captain?

Upriver? Why upriver? There is nothing there, only jungle.

I guess this is whAt men of war do -- eh?

Where've you been riding, Lance?

They far enough?

Why the hell didn't you tell me about that place -- a good left.  There aren't any good left slides in this whole, shitty country. It's all goddamn beach break.

Captain B-L. Willard, sir -- 4th Recon Group -- I carry priority papers from Com-Sec Intelligence 11 Corp -- I believe you understand the nature of my mission.

What'd you do for supplies?

'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz still alive?

You talk like him. I don't mind taking casualties, Captain, but I like to keep my ratio ten to one in this unit -- ten Cong to one.

We'll come in low out of the rising sun -- We'll put on the music about a mile out.

I'm waiting for the fucking boat, Colonel.

Colonel Kurtz, I guess.

I think think a lie stinks.

I had immense plans.

Yes...

You were his friend... You must have been, if he had given you this...  If he sent you to his home. He was the best this country had -- he was --

Were you with him, when...

He'll kill us.

Captain -- that was all true about the rats and chocolate and stuff?

The other one --

Now I can get out a here -- if I can find a way out.

Simple. They don't want him to go.

Who are you?

Do you miss your home, Captain? Have you someone there?

That strange things.. terrible things have occured around this American, Kurtz.

Are you warm, Captain?

What if I say no.

What show ?

Soldier -- where''s your C.O.?

You came right to it, son of a bitch --

Hard to work up an interest in politics, way we live.  You're the first people we've seen in two weeks.

30   CONTINUED:

34   CONTINUED:

See the blood?  Pack of wolves took down a moose.  Greedy, gut-ripping sons of bitches.  I'd kill the last wolf on earth, right in front of the President of the U.S.  Stinking, cowardly predator, the wolf.

What makes you so sure my boys won't be waiting for us?

Remember that demon in the gut? Sometimes it's nothing more than wondering if the so-called civilized life has bred the balls and brains out of you.  That's what you want out of this, isn't it?

48   CONTINUED:

Let's go.

165  CONTINUED:  

165  CONTINUED:  

You'll catch a chill by that dumb waiter shaft.  Sit on the cot.  Keep this pointed at him if I get preoccupied.

184  CONTINUED:

39   CONTINUED:

How long have you been up north?

Had?

How did she..?

What happened here?

He's coming around fine.

Stay here.

Please, Anne Marie, you being here only complicates things.

You're hurt.

Kenai at the general store asked me to bring these.  Didn't expect we'd already met.

Desmond.

Six months.  Ecological study for Northland Oil.

Nice bluff the other day with the tranquilizer gun out your jeep window.  See you again, maybe.

Surviving is what I know --

Sounds like professional jealousy.

Ice is too thin -- you can see the water moving underneath.

Most dangerous thing in the world: A regular Joe, in over his head.  You trying to prove how tough you are for me, or for yourself?

Let's camp.  There's grayling under this ice. I'll snare some for dinner.

Damn lucky this storm didn't blow down when we were on those baldheaded mountains.  It continues, we better stay put.

Stay awake!  You want to go hypothermic?

Emergency transmitter?  All your gear is back at Wilder's.

It was blown up with the plane.

I'm hungry.  Go kill me some dinner.

They think you're in Fairbanks. If not, they still won't find you before the plane comes tomorrow.

Emergency transmitter?  What happened to signal mirrors or two-tone smoke fires?

Maybe you can talk sense into your boyfriend.

Hullo, Sam.  Slow day?

-- Here's a hundred dollars.  And if you or anyone else will back me up on this --

What's wrong?

Wilder's missing church services; you believe it?

Dead.  Trappers killed him.

Thought that door was open last night...

There's what they're waiting on!

... moving in the wrong direction... Away from when I even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for Christ's sake. I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married.  Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. He has to make up for his mom not getting any.  Oh, boy. Who needs these thoughts?

I'm sorry.

My wife is Melvin Udall's publisher.  She says I have to take great care of this guy because you're urgently needed back at work. What work do you do?

Have they done blood tests on him?

They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin?

The table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it. Two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee.

Clippity clop -- clippity clop -- she has to pretend she doesn't hear me. Listening to the story from the upset friend...  now she drops off the cappuccino and smiles at the putzette who doesn't even say, "Thank you." No, the putzette wanted the whipped cream so back she goes and now she has to pass him again and it's getting tougher to make believe.

What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours...  afraid it isn't clean?

Sorry.

Okay, pal...  I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.

I'm hungry.  You've upset my whole day. I haven't eaten.

That's not why I'm here...  ...  though you have no idea what it's like to have a real conversation with a doctor about Spencer...

Okay.

My son.

Melvin... I'd like to know exactly where we are going.

No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't mean it. You gotta sit down. You can still give me the dirty look... just sit down and give it to me.

If you ask me... I'll say, "yes."

I don't want to hear that music right now.

I don't.

How you doing?

Cute.

What job?

I wasn't asleep!!

Boyfriend?

If you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner. There's a shot it'll open soon -- that way we're not screwy -- we're just two people who like warm rolls.

Hey, I've got a great compliment for you.

No! It's certainly not. No -- I don't think so. No.

I don't know the last time I've been out of the city... Hey, my arms are tanning. I used to tan great. We gotta stop soon so'se I can check on Spencer.

Was this supposed to be your room?

Can you not be violent?

Good night.

But you're beautiful... your skin glows.

I'm filling in. We don't know if she's coming back. She might have to get a job closer to home.

Explain to me how you can diagnose someone as "obsessive compulsive disorder" and then act like I have any choice in barging in.

You changed the room around...

He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?

Hey, hey...  Haaa...  bad but temporary. The nurses say it's much better than you looked three weeks ago...  the hand will come back...  they're sure...

You are very certain my dog is okay...  because you have no idea...

Simon, you've got to get dressed.

No touch. No touch. No touch.

You're taking him...  yes...  you're taking him -- this will clear the books. One night. You want to say "no" to me? Try...  because I've never felt as nuts as I do right this second. I almost want you to try saying "no."

Yeah, but it's all about Simon now... you helped with the dog... And now there are other things. I'm just as concerned as you are about Simon.

It's not only financial assistance. What he's got to do is go to Baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. It's not going to happen on the phone.

Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high maintenance selling painter coming through... So I'm out. Can you take him?

Take my car -- a convertible. Do you drive?

Absolutely.

Sure thing.

Mr. Udall... excuse me. Hey there!  Have you seen Verdell?

Yeeeess!!!

I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.

No, I didn't.

Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making.

Maybe I'll bring him some food by.

Well, I'll do one thing for you that might cheer you up.

Now we'll both call him.

Well, I always painted. Always. And my mother always encouraged it. She was sort of fabulous about it actually... and she used to... I was too young to think there was anything at all wrong with it... and she was very natural. She used to pose nude for me... and I thought or assumed my father was aware of it.

What are you talking about? You got real problems.

Did you like it that much?

Picking on me won't help.

Exactly what is your previous experience?

What?

No shit.

Boy, that's fucking genius.  You're a fucking genius.  Then you're just sitting there, bullshitting with me. Man, no way I coulda done that!

You don't have to tell me that. It's just, I know my bid was low, but was it too low?  I mean, did I seem like an amateur, like I didn't know what I was doing?

So what happens now?

You understand what's going on?  It makes sense, right?

I'm on the scent.

They money will be standard bank transfer.  We believe we will know where and when.

Good afternoon.  We have reservations at the Hotel Paraiso in Costa Blanca.

What?

I have been sitting on a contract from Cleveland for six days because of you.

What?

You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro.

Twenty large?  That's all?

Now what?

Why?

Forget it!

Don't tell me I don't have a choice!

I don't need you to get the money -- my money!

Oh Jesus Jesus...

What I'm trying to say is that -- I'm not sure I can do this, help you, unless I know more about you.

Because I'm done.

More or less.

I was just different.

No.  I graduated from George Washington University.  Then I entered the Agency training program.

Because you are a women.

The same reason everyone does.  You hear your name on C-SPAN and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you.

Hey, where are you?

About?

That's where he'll be.

It helps me to focus.  It centers me, helps me think.

Do you think about the game?

I'm kind of tired.  I think I'd like to try and get some sleep.

Breakfast.

You'll be here.  A restaurant.  A public place far enough away that he won't notice you, but with a good enough view you'll be able to see him when he moves inside.

He can't.  The bank has an expensive security system; metal detectors and X-ray machines.

That's right.

If things go well, I don't have to. You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me.

I'll be walking out of the bank, unarmed.  You'll have the gun and I'll drive the car.

What happened?

What did he say?

Why did you trade a bishop for a knight?

Did you think they were newlyweds?

When I first saw them I thought they were married.

I know.  It makes me crazy.

That's a ridiculous move.

Is that why you didn't want to talk about women before?

Uh-huh.

Four minutes.

Electra --

I wasn't watching television.

I'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus.

Would you like a drink?

Do you ever regret things you've done?

I think I've heard of you.

I know this may seem like a strange question, but can I ask you how much the contract was for -- not to insult you or anything, I know you're a professional, but just for me, I was just wondering.

Don't know.  That's how it works.

Look at that.  I haven't watched the sun set in a million years. Do you mind?

Well, he sure seems fired up all of a sudden.

He_s the closest we've got to an intellectual.

You guys having a go a me or what?

Sorry Katka, but I'm with Doug on this.

What about that squat bar you showed me, is that open on a Sunday?

I don't have the money for those Bourgeois traps. Hell, I'm making what a Czech earns.

Just because they've got a choice of four McDonalds, doesn't mean they can afford a cheeseburger.

Squatted it.

He's not drunk, he's crazy.

Okay, we're listening. But I'm with Katka on this one.

Damn right it is, it's a chance to do something meaningful for a change, to leave our mark on this town. Hell, you'll probably be gone in another six months and all you'll have done is taught some kids the lines to a Led Zep' song - c'mon, don't run out on me now!

And put it on expenses?

Later Mate, right now I've got to do the locks on these doors so we don't have to climb through that bloody window every time.

No.....But I think Honza at the office has. You keep shifting this crap and I'll take care of the locks, shouldn't take long. Take a break for lunch and I'll catch you up later.

Yep, except a name for this place.

Wow!....What have you been doing, rolling around in it?

Oh yeah, what's my connection to that?

It must be fair old size, suppose it's empty?

I'll rig up something don't worry - Do you think I could bash through with that little hammer?

Do you think anyone will really come here?

Fancy some lunch after we_re through with this Meccano shit?

We'd better get some booze in for tonight.

Here, let's both put in two hundred crowns. That should get nine or ten bottles of wine.

You get the wine and I'll go see if I can rustle up some plastic cups.

Shit no, it'll be twice cost.

Chris! Tell me some good news.

I don't want to ruin your day.

I don't know, I'm waiting for the transcript.

Well, the trial's in two weeks, but I think they've already sentenced me. They just need to check if Siberia can slot me in.

Now you're using that word.

Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.

Doug, I can't just leave you!

Time for lunch I think. I'll get the sandwiches. What would you like Holly?

Yeah, pretty well.

Your home address is 18 Thornton Avenue, Coventry.

Now, have you been read your rights and are you aware of the charges?

I've been around.

I could pencil you in if you like?

Turned Czech huh?

Doug you said you wouldn't be long. Come on, I've got to go. Now!

Will it help to get you out?

If you get out can we be together again.

No, I am an actor not a labourer, I am just warning you, that's all.

Yes, The Obelisk but it's closed for repairs.

Sure, they are students.

Yeah, it's a simple piece. If they get the floor done in time, me and the others will rehearse tomorrow afternoon, but it's not critical.

Yes, of course...maybe one hour.

Tomorrow, we will bring some lights and also hang some fabric. I think it will be finished in the morning.

You mean you don't know, Henry! We got a bunch of anarchists, controlling a six-level block of luxury apartments down on Janovska street here in the Old Town, and you don't know about it?

I'm in close with these guys, it isn't easy, but slowly they're opening up to me. Give me a month and I'll blow their movement wide open.

You can hold back this months pay-check until I come through with the story.

How do I know what's being said?

I thought I'd help out.

Why are you doing all this, what for?

Shall I wash these out?

It's all my fault, I'm so sorry Doug.

Don't you have a girlfriend?

Did you take your things over to my place?

Why don't we both forget about him?

Why did you break into that particular building?

Really!

Good try Mr. Greenwell but a little late. We have analyzed the contents of that drum, the remains of the disks are there, just as you said.

No, just a drill.

And a fifty foot extension lead?

Shit Honey, you could've told me. People might think it's about us!

Yeah, so I hear. Don't you think you should go get changed?

I don't want to go.

That's my bag.

Will you come home and forget all about him?

What are you an idiot!

And what of these foreigners?

Delay Mr Greenwell's departure until the disks have been located and you have notified me. Then, have one of your officers drive him home - I'll see to the rest.

She asleep?

After he moved out, I invited him to every practice, every game, every parent-teacher conference you ever had. He didn't show, not once.

A late night or an early morning?

Honey, some of this is... farfetched. You take after me. People skills and common sense. Good dependable qualities.

Now it's okay?

Everything's being done but it's not enough. I have to find something -- more.

And that you're scamming on Jamie Sullivan.

Get yourself a glass.

'I hope your dreams come true.'

You're like this fly, buzzing buzzing everywhere --

What's with the friggin numbers?

I'll take a chance.

No problem --

I know. Don't say anything.

Because I try to be nice to people?

Saturn. Beautiful.

I'm building a larger one to see the nucleus of Haley's Comet --

Yeah.  I'm probably not going to be around next time it comes.

Yeah.

He doesn't trust you.

The play's going to be really good.

So it's like you want to be secret friends.

I don't want to be just your friend --

It's a start.

Hey.

Before we do this.

Help me live until I die?

Whatever you need. Whatever Jamie needs. I'm here.  I could start by driving her to school --

You know how to waltz??

How you doing?

'Love is always patient and kind. It is never boastful or conceited -- '

It's gone now.

The Carter boy. Tell me about him.

Did you give him a gift?

You're in the play?

Reverend Sullivan. Can I ask you something?

This week.

You could grace our hallowed halls again, if, while you're here, you make a sincere effort to be part of our little school community --

Finally, I'd like you to join the drama club. Rehearsals are Tuesday and Thursday evenings.

And you never heard of rock 'n roll?

Morning Dick.

Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay.  You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night.

Then you'll be going to school here....?

What time does school start around here?

He comes out of the cafeteria line, he's nervous, he spills his corn, and he asks you to the dance!

Are you all right, Marty? You seem a little...nervous.

Dad, you seen the drill?

No, Chinese food is fine.

The sunrise? What for?

What do I say?

What is that? A pencil that writes in ink?

Okay. So right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me -

Why what?

You know damn well that's not what I meant.

Yes, that's my name. Who are you, young man? Are you supposed to be here?

I'm sorry, there's no answer.

March 11th.

Catch you later! 

Marty, that would alter history.

Professor, you time machine works! It works! It sent me back in time! I'm from 1982!

He will be. Simple inebriation, is all. The young man must have a rather low tolerance for alcohol... something that runs in the family. You see, he's a second cousin of mine on my mother's side. Came quite a distance to visit me, he added. His name's Lewis.

I am serious. If we could get you, the time machine, and the power converter in the vicinity of an atomic blast, we could send you back to the future.

Look, it's not a big deal! I can fix it! All I gotta do is get 'em together and make sure my old man asks her out!

Where did you get this?

In a manner of speaking, yes. And because of that, she's no longer interested in your father.

That's exactly what I said! I mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?

Thanks for everything, Pro.

Marty,  I know I've repeatedly asked you not to tell me anything about the future, but....well, those loud bangs on the tape recorder....are they....

What year is this?

What theater was I at?

Sweet and what?  Maybe you'd better pay for this first.

Look, maybe I'd better talk to Dick. Is he around?

What happened to Dick Wilson?

Hi. where's Cato?

Yeah, I guess.

Kit... Maybe I'd better get a shovel.

That your spider in there? In that bottle?

You ever held another job before?

We did it, Ray.

Say, what kind of rifle was that you were shooting at me?

Kit... Kit, I've got a question for you.

Hey, listen, Tom, I don't mean to tell you how to run your show here but these cuffs are pinching. What do you say now?

Hi.

What for?

No, you're not either.

Okay.

Jack.

Well, that I shouldn't be seen with anybody that collects garbage.

Nothing.

Quit my job.

Don't call me stupid.

Yeah, you look tired... Listen, honey. when all this is over, I'm going to sit down and buy you a big, thick steak.

No.

Yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. He's sick.

This your place?

You tossed my hat out the window.

Not me. No way.

There's another one we owe 'em.

Smells fermented.  Check in with the Institute, Reno, see if everything's kosher.

We will, old fried, we will.

Anybody we know?

Does this thing have guns, John Parker?

They're arachtoids, Buckaroo, from Planet 10!

They're armed for bear, Buckaroo.  Check out those radiation levels.

Nobody's a nobody.  Why're you crying?  What's wrong?

He offered you money?

Let me go, let me go, you creeps...

Go away.  Let me rot?

Was she pretty?

Open up or I'll shoot it off.

Looks like you're the one might go to pieces.

Please, Penny.  You just gotta trust me now.  Okay?  And don't panic. Because it's gonna be all right.

How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?

Where's Buckaroo?  Is he alive?

What's his problem?

Doctor Lizardo. Wasn't he on TV once?

Now twenty seconds downrange...Perfect Tommy, how on earth is Buckaroo able to keep that thing on the ground?

I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr Fink?

I'll tell Bill you dropped by. I'm sure he'll want to reschedule your appointment.

I see.

...Oh Barton, I feel so... sorry for him!

And my input was mostly... EDITORIAL, really, when he'd been drinking-

So now I'm s'posed to roll over like an ol' bitch dog gettin' ger belly scratched.

...Hello.

No, I  I didn't mean to sound 

Ever talk to him?

Sir, I'm flattered that you even recognize my name. My God, I had no idea you were in Hollywood.

On the Beery picture! Where are we? Wuddya got?

Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! Started?!  You mean you don't have ANYthing?!

Fair enough. No pressure here, Barton, because I respect you, but let me point out a couple of things. One, here you make a difference to five hundred fifty people a night  if the show sells out.  Eighty five million people go to the pictures every week.

...I guess I'm sprouting off again. But I am certain of this, Garland: I'm capable of more good work. Maybe better work than I did in Choirs. It just doesn't seem to me that Los Angeles is the place to lead the life of mind.

...Look, they love you, kid  everybody does. You see Caven's review in the Herald?

What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking?

And what's your line, Mr. Meadows?

Well ain't that a kick in the head!

Sure, sure Charlie, you can help by just being yourself.

Ah, doctors. What's he gonna tell me?  Can't trade my head in for a new one.

...This must be boring you.

...Probably sounds a little grand coming from someone who's writing a wrestling picture for Wallace Beery.

...Did I say rude? People can be goddamn cruel. Especially some of their housewives. Okay, so I've got a weight problem. That's my cross to bear. I dunno...

...Listen to me belly-achin'. As if my problems amounted to a hill of beans. How goes the life of the mind?

And there's hope for you too, Charlie. Tomorrow I bet you sell a half-dozen policies.

Are you sure 

Why don't we go to your room-

Hold on 

Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. Tell me what happened.

Jesus... You're leaving.

Sure, Charlie.

Never heard of it. Let's move him to the Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, he can stay at my place.

...Well Bart, which is it? Orphan? Dame?

Yeah... rye whiskey?

...Are you a tranz or a rez?

Jesus! Ain't that a load off! You live in 605?

Is this multiple choice?

...Yeah, he... he lives next door to me.

Yeah, and I'm Buck Rogers.

Good luck with no fuckin' head.

Sixth floor too high for you, Fink?

All night?

We got a call from Berkeley P.D. There was a killing.  A professor. Icepick.  In his bed.  Multiple stab wounds.  1977.

Take care, you hear?

You're on leave, man.  You're on psycho leave.  I'm talking to a possible whacko here.

What was she like?

I need a cigarette.

I thought you hardly know her.

I did dye my hair.  It didn't have anything to do with her.  I was a redhead for a while, too.

Why did you change your name?

You should do something about this lock.

Don't!  I know about your husband.  You still like girls, Beth?

How long were you having sex with him?

Were you with him last night?

Did you leave the club with him?

Did you go home with him?

Was there anyone with you last night?

Do you always keep old newspapers around?

I thought you were out of cigarettes.

Writing a book about it gives you an alibi for not killing him.

You like playing games, don't you?

Am I... disturbing you?

What happened, Nick?  Did you get sucked into it? Did you like it too much?

I didn't.

How exactly did you hear?

You're not easy to figure.  I'm just very good at figuring.

Why not?

Aren't you going to thank me?

When did you write it?

What did you think?

Are you kidding?  You think this is my idea of morning-after conversation?

I thought that business with the scarf was pretty nifty.

You're in over your head.

I should have known.  I came into the house when you were down on the beach.  She looked at me so strangely.  She left right after you.  I shouldn't have let her watch us. She wanted to watch me all the time.  She tried to kill you, didn't she?

I would've paid more.  I wanted to know everything about you.  Then you came down here after Johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better.

How'd you get in here?

You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.

I have to do some research tomorrow.

A detective.  He falls for the wrong girl.

What do we do now, Nick?

I'm John Corrigan.  I'm an assistant district attorney, Ms.  Tramell. Can we get you anything?  Would you like some coffee?

Would you tell us the nature of your relationship with Mr. Boz?

Did you kill Mr. Boz, Ms. Tramell?

I don't really feel like talking anymore.

You have the right to an attorney.

It teaches you to lie.

He was walking home from work. They only lived a coupla blocks from the clinic.  Somebody drove by and shot him.

Nope, can't say that I do.

Thanks.

Who was this fuckin' guy?

I don't know.

You think I --

I don't think it's funny.

Forgive me for askin', son, and I don't mean to belabor the obvious, but why is it that you've got your head so far up your own ass?

I don't give a... flyin'... chili- bean... fart about AIDS!

I don't know.  I'm just not.

Why not?

If she's telling  you the truth.

Where the hell you goin'?

Homicide.

What was the motive?

Are you kidding me?

Now what?

She knew she could beat it.  That's why she asked to take it.

I'll ask you once, Nick -- for the record did you kill him?

Tell me again.  I want to hear you say it again.

We know you're not stupid, Ms. Tramell.

Who are you?

How old was she when this happened?

Is this finished yet?

What do you think?

Why, so you could humiliate me?

This is painted on a backdrop from the Kabuki theater in Japan. I painted it after Joseph Beuys died. A rebirth painting. I felt like he could've painted it, or maybe someone else was painting it instead of me. The Chinese calligraphers used to change their name mid-career so they could start over as someone else..

Nixon lives in Saddle River, New York.

New York.

You wanna buy some ignorant art? Ten bucks.

I wish they'd quit writing this shit about me.

Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors  anything with a SAMO tag on it.  The other day, I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. A week later this gallery calls me up: "Somebody's offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five thousand?"

Yeah  I'd do that... You could teach me.

Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her.

That was my favorite part!

Bruno called. In Europe, people are saying you're gonna die from drugs. They think they can cash in on your death.

Well, I don't want to get mugged on a Bowery street corner. Maybe I could find a place for you to work. Take my card.

When?

It's great that people are interested, but if anyone's going to buy anything, I'll handle it for you. Everything goes through the gallery, even if they come to your studio.

You shouldn't have put it in the show. This is the one I absolutely have to have. I really love it.

B.B. It's me  Jean! What's the matter? No snow in Switzerland this year?

Bruno spoke to me already. We could talk about it.

What is it that gets you out of bed in the morning? 

... Can you... decipher this for us?

What are they?

Not what?

Yes, yes... Let's talk about that.... your roots... Your father is from Haiti, isn't he?

Why, that's from Time Magazine.

Yeah.

 In this corner?

Hey  Willie Mays.

"She loves me. Oh yeah she loves me! She loooooooves me, Oh yeah she loves me!" Bring me some chicken, baby!

I knew I left these somewhere. One of these'll send your kids to college someday.  Here  I made this for you.

You got a date already?

That's not how I meant it.  For all you know, you might just be a flash in the pan! You can never tell.

Drugs??!

Guess I just got sick of him.

Do you know what he's saying?

It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone.

I'm your family.

You look fucking beautiful, beautiful.

So are you really friends with Andy? He seems like such a weirdo.

Wow. Congratulations. I hate that asshole.  Thanks for coming. I guess I just wanted to find out how you're 

I really... admire you.

Come on.

What? Wait a minute... talk to me.

What is it you want? Respect? I have respect for you, just for making this call. One philosopher said "Sadness is a sin against the richness of the world." Think about it. Feel it.

I suppose you feel better now, sir.

Mr. Wayne ... a reminder:  Tonight is that loathsome party, hosted by that odious Mr. Shreck.  May we RSVP in the resoundingly negative?

I guess this mean we won.

How could you?  I'm a woman...

A kiss under the misteltoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...

You're the second man who killed me this week.  But hey, no prob ... I've got seven lives left.

Pouring myself into my work.

The news these days ... weird. People looking to superheroes for their peace of mind, and blaming their problems on super-villains ... instead of themselves, or their spouses at least.

I'm sure he's wonderful company and all, but ... doesn't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale?

I, ah ... never fool around on the first date.

Not compared to that "Cobblepot" person you're promoting...

I am the light of this city.  <u>And</u> I am its mean, twisted soul.  Does it really matter who's the "mayor"?

Are you perchance a registered voter?  I'm also a mayoral prospect.

I oughta have you spayed!  You sent out all the signals!

I ... it was terrible, I leaned over, and accidentally knocked her, out --

Most of all, I want to find out who I am.  By finding my parents. Learning my "human" name.  Simple stuff that the good people of Gotham take for granted.

A platform?  Lemme see ... Stop global warming.  Start global cooling.  Make the world a colder place.  <u>Frigid</u> ...

Why, how industrious.  And how did you open protected files, may I ask?

Joanna and I were in love in London. But when I realized our age difference was too extreme -

Pamela Isley.  I was so attracted to her I couldn't reason clearly.  I still can't.  She used to work for Wayne Enterprises.  Find a file.

What is it?

Sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.

Al's main squeeze.  Is she here?  I'm about to scrape the bottom of my shoe off my tongue, right?

I could have made it, you know.  I didn't need your help.

Of course, Dick Grayson, ward of the fabulously wealthy Bruce Wayne. Why would you need a few hundred dollars?

I started racing after my parents died.  There was something about the speed, the danger, that took me out of myself, that made the hurt go away.  You wouldn't understand.

Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?

Crimefighter's rule number two.

You were a great scientist once. Don't squander your genius on evil.

Mr. Bane, I'll finish off the city. You, as they say in showbiz, are on.  Take the boys and kill the kids. But bring me the Bat.

Go on, kill me too.  Just as you killed my wife.

This is all about fashion for you, isn't it?

Of course.  He's going to steal the giant white diamond.

You think Freeze will take the bait?

I can't believe we were fighting over a  bad guy.

How did you...?

Remember the victim at the airport. Toxins introduced through the mouth.

I guess we'll just have to kill her.

No sign of the snowman.

Acceptable losses in a battle to save the planet.

Make a choice, Bruce.  Her or me.

That's gotta hurt.

Absolutely.  Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.

Dick, you were reckless.  You could have been killed.

Of course.  Alfred still keeps your mother's picture in his room.

He's dying.  And I can't deal with it.

I checked the medical database.  No one else is even close.

One question.  When Batgirl and I rolled off the telescope, how come you didn't try and save us? It was the first time I fell and you weren't there to catch me.

Let me guess, Plant Girl? Vine Lady? Ms. Moss?

You will rescue my wife

Prepare for a bitter harvest. Winter has come at last.

Freezy, I'm feeling...hot.

Give it up.  If you threw yourself-

Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun.  He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.

Bad luck, I'm afraid.  It's time to die, little bird.

You should have heeded your pointy- eared pal.  These lips can be murder.

Join you?  I've spent my life trying to protect plants from extinction and now you corrupt my research into some maniacal scheme for world domination. When I get through you won't be able to get a job teaching high school chemistry, do you hear me, you psycho?

Dr. Isley?  Pamela?  You look great. Especially for a dead woman.

Gee, I'm not sure.  Alfred? How many rooms? Total?

Too much wealth. Too fast. Half of Gotham zombied-out. A technology that self destructs. He's protecting more than industrial secrets, Alfred.

Maybe they're right.

Why do I keep doing this?

Old habits die hard. Are you alright?

There's one other thing. I feel..

What do maniacs always want?

_Two_ million dollars waiting to be transferred from the _Second_ Bank of Gotham on the _22nd_ How could Harvey? _Two_-Face resist?

...dual personalities. Abnormal psychology. Washington's poster child for the criminally insane. I read your work.

A girl cannot live by psychoses alone.

We all wear masks.

I haven't had much luck with women...

Help Chase. I'll be back.

Death.  Death. Without taste, sound and all around us.  Because there is no way for me to save them or myself. This is one giant death trap.

Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?

Mr. Nygma, you'll forgive me for being rude. But what exactly is on your mind?

So glad you could come.

What? Oh, it's very impressive.

Rinka.

I notice you've sub-divided your B coupons. Feeling a little light on principle?

Still play with dolls, Doctor?

Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.

The style of the letters I'm getting matches those found at the crime sites. Why would The Riddler be sending me riddles?  Who's your decorator? U-Haul?

Find anything interesting?

Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.

There's something I want to talk with you about. It's...Well, we.. I...

I don't-.

Back off, man.

It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?

Dr. Burton tells me you know who Batman is.

Who is The Batman, Edward?

No.  Wait...

Where are you sending Batboy this time?

Sure, E = MC squared. Until you factor in more than three dimensions. Then... Damn. Hit us again.

A hit.

Mr. Wayne is out for the day.

Look! Police!

The Joker is a murderer. And you were as good as dead. So --

... How long have I been out?

What is this stuff? Kevlar?

I just can't absorb it all. This place, the equipment. What it must have cost.  Why all the secrecy? Why do you wear the mask?

See, I don't know how it happened... she's a smart girl and you are an extraordinary screwed-up guy... but she's in love with you.

No.

What did you see?

To tell you the truth, I'd just about given up waiting.

I know it's late. I -- Are you there?

I'm sorry I had to stand you up today. I'd like to make it up to you.

Vicki?... This is Batman. I thought I'd call and see how you're doing.

All right, Bruce, what do you suggest?

I missed you, Lieutenant.

Got it all figured, huh?  Grissom just sits back and hands you the reins.  -- Maybe he don't know what we know.

That ain't what I heard.  That ain't what I heard at all.  I heard the bat got him.

My brother's a priest, man.

I understand.

Jack - - please - - WIPE THAT LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE.

And what happens if we say no?

... Thank you.

And you want a --

... Why the mask?

Oh, it's too good.  We got a six-foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.

No.

Plain or roasted?  Alex, I'm very flattered that you've gone out and done all this research.

Nice snap, huh?  Pulitzer Prize, 1963.

Jesus, Vicki! Where is it??

David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?

Scottish.

Jesus.

Go ahead.

Shut up, Kevin.  Honey, you-re not making sense ...

Hi,

Two dollars please.

Oh Jesus.  Oh God.  Oh Jesus God.  Oh Mary Mother of Jesus. Oh Jesus of Nazareth.

I was hoping DU.  Bean might take a look at my computer project today.

'Emergency measures, in your book means sack people right?

Great day.  At last we can start getting out of debt and concentrating on the future.

Everything okay, David?

He's a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and the 21st century.

Say that again, son.

Tomorrow.  You have a problem with that?

You're not going to ....

I think you're wrong, David.  She looks as fine as she's ever looked. Worth every cent of the 10 million dollar-s.

Well, congratulations.  Isn't that great, David?

Bye, Dad.

You arrange those flowers yourself?

Who do you think is the ugliest guy who ever lived.

He was incredible.  This guy is fearless.  He has no fear.

Hey, En, nice bike'- but remember: any kids you have are gonna look just like its handsome driver.

... in the distant future.

It is urgent, sir.

You know the thing I hate most about children?

Whoa! I think I just figured something out Beavis.

Huh huh huh. That was cool.

Beavis, you butt-munch, this guy wants us to score with his wife. And he's gonna pay us. We can buy a new TV.

Uh, huh huh, this is Las Vegas?

Uh... Hey baby. Are we like, doing it?

This is dumb, let's find that chick.

Beavis, huh huh, what'er you doing?

Ow! Cut it out Butt-Head.

This sucks. It's all hot and stuff.

Whoa, my life is cool!

I always thought there was something wrong with him. Heh heh heh.

Yeah, and um, he used to hit me too.

Cigarettes and beer rule! Huh huh.

Um, uh, butt... um, hole. Butt-hole...

You already said that, Butt-Head.

Hey, Butt-Head, it's that slut from the plane!

Talk ta me, Bork.

What the hell...? Bork! That bus we picked up. Where was it headin'?

We just cleared all four floors. No sign of him.

She's holed up in a hotel room in Las Veags. Your flight leaves in a couple of hours. Now c'mon, I'll drive you to the airport.

Meet Sylvia. And Elloise and Sam. And Ed. And Doreen.

Whoa, this kicks ass! Huh huh huh.

Really? That's where we're from.

Shut up, dumb-ass! You didn't score. I scored with both of them...

Ten grand? That cheap-ass... I got a better deal for ya. I'll double it. I'll pay ya twenty if you go back there and do mah husband.

Adam my booyy!  When you're really rich in what matters...  ... nothing matters!  My buyer has just made a killing in condos in the Village.  And he's got a little stress problem...  ... so his wife says they want the old peace and quiet!

Yeah, I want to get one coat on the wardrobe and then I'll help you.

This fire wasn't burning when we left the house.

There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?

She can't see you, right?  In the book, Rule Number Two: the living usually won't see the dead.

I guess... if I'm going to be dead, I'll just have to be the best dead person ever!

Is this a punishment for something we did in life?  What can we do?

Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me alone.

That little girl saw us.

But she <u>saw</u> us.  I could feel it.

There's nothing we can do.  It's just a matter of time before they unlock this room.  There goes my model.  There goes our last refuge.

Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!

Honey.  Let's go.

Lydia, believe me... we know... all the hard stuff is the same over here.  You're going to be who you are... whether you're alive or dead ... and over here -- it's... It's flat... there's no food, no colors ... you can't smell the flowers.  If we knew then what we know now we'd have been more careful...

Nobody else can.

You tell them that we are desperate horrible ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing to get back our house.

You don't have an appointment, do you?

Help vouchers?

This is <u>my</u> town.

Hell is other people.  You obviously don't read much. Besides things seem pretty quiet here.  You should thank God you didn't die in Italy.  The Deetzes.  Okay.  Have you been studying the manual?

I heard.  Tore your face right off!  Bad news.  It obviously doesn't do any good to pull your heads off in front of people if they can't see you.

All right.  Who are you?

I don't like Charles Deetz particularly, but you could have <u>killed</u> him.

I'd nearly given up on you.  I was about to leave.  I do have other clients.

No, you don't!  He does not work well with others.

I want to be dead too.

So, <u>never</u> let Beetle Juice out. Never.  Besides...  We're thinking about letting everyone stay... You and your father and mother can stay too.

How'd you do on the science test?

You could double the size of your hardware store!  You'll be rich.

Beetle!

Your name is <u>Beetle Juice</u>?  Yecch! That's as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz.

God, you're anatomically correct!

W... What is it?

Your qu...?  But you're...

Otho'll know what to do.

Lydia, relax.  We'll build you a darkroom in the basement.

Where is your mother?

Stepmother's...

I don't care from guilt.  I just want to <u>see</u> them.

Are they suffering?

I plan to have a stroke from the amount of MSG that's in this food.

What's wrong?

Otho, I can<u>not</u> <u>live</u> with these cheap domestic floor tiles.

You don't have a key?

Well there's a Little Deetz at least.  Boy, when you city people do something, you do it right, don't you?

Are we going to be seeing you at Miss Shannon's Boarding School?

Perhaps if I were properly motivated.

The injection will ease the pain and swelling, Mr. Gardiner.

However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after.

An attorney?

I'll send Wilson up to take you for X-rays, Mr. Gardiner. Feel free to use the telephone, and please let me know if you have any discomfort.

I swear, Chauncey, between you and Benjamin, I've got my hands full...  ... Say, that is coming along, the swelling has gone down considerably...  ... Any pain here?

... Oh? You've heard?

Will you be leaving now, Robert?

I know exactly what you mean. Today the businessman is at the mercy of kid-lawyers from the SEC. All they want to do is regulate our natural growth! It's happening across the country!

... He walked off...

Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice.  ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something?

... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?

... I'll feel so relieved after Dr. Allenby examines your leg. After that, David can run you on home, or to your office or wherever you'd prefer...  ... Is there anything special you would like to watch?

... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?

Chauncey, I wanted to tell you how dreadful I feel about the accident today, but that I'm delighted that you are staying with us.

Yes... I know, Chauncey.

Chauncey!

Forgive me, Chauncey - I didn't mean to pry. You must have been very close to him.

I'm sorry...  ... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?

... I'm...  ... I'm very grateful that you're here, Chauncey...  ... With us ...

... Is that all you want...?  ... To watch me...?

Chauncey! Chauncey!

Oh, Chauncey, darling... Where have you been? We thought we'd lost you - we've been looking all over!

Hello, Mr. Gardiner. This is Sid Courtney, Washington Post.

Then, I'll be brief. I covered the President's speech at the Financial Institute today, and since the Post would like to be as exact as possible, we would appreciate your comments on the meeting that took place between Mr. Rand, the President and yourself.

Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.

... Are you sure you like it?

You must sit with us, my friend, we have much to discuss.

... Mr. Gardiner, I wish to be quite candid - considering the gravity of your economic situation, shouldn't we, the diplomats, and you, the businessman - get together more often?

To exchange our thoughts - what does a Russian know about business? On the other hand, what does an American know about diplomacy?

Bravo! Bravo! Our chairs are indeed almost touching! And we want to remain seated on them, correct? We don't want them snatched from under us, am I right? Because if one goes, the other goes, and then - boom! Boom! And we are both down before our time, you see? And neither of us wants that, do you agree?

Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you by any chance enjoy Krylov's fables? I ask this because there is something... there is something Krylovian about you.

So you know your Krylov in Russian, do you? Mr. Gardiner, I must confess I had suspected as much all along - I know an educated man when I meet one!

Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov!

No, thank you. My house has been closed.

It's a very pleasant room, Ben.

I could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore.

Well, that's good news, my boy.

Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength...  Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...

We could do it now, we can go upstairs.  ... Please, it's time for us. Come upstairs.

Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone?

Well, if that's what you want, then I want it too.  We can go this way.

Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?

Of course not! No one has the time to read! One glances at things, watches television...

Please, sir.

Does it have a television?

... Well, ain't you the gentleman this mornin'...  ... gotta go now, Chance...

I know that, Mr. Gardiner.

Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. Do you go along with this belief?

Louise?... The maid?...  But she should have left earlier today...

Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist?

1952...?

... Do you drive this, Mr. Chance?

What are your plans now, Mr. Chance?

No, Thomas. I don't know how to sign.

Good morning, Mr. President.

Yes. I will.

... Skip the levity, Kinney - what have you got?

Sure, try again - where? There's nothing, it's like he never existed!

Oh, Ben - I miss you so when I'm out... How are you feeling?

No headaches?

Do you feel well enough for that?

Good evening, Mrs. Rand.

Come on, Eve. Let's let the men talk, there are so many people that have been asking about you.

It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...

... What do you make of all this?

No! He's a real gardener!

Yes? What have you found?

What do you mean there is nothing? That's impossible.

And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.

This information goes back three days. I want the standard file, you know that.

I'd like to hear that data, Kaufman.

Sorry to disturb you, chief but we have new developments.

That is correct, Comrade Skrapinov. We have ascertained that Gardiner heads a big-business power group that will soon be taking over the American government.

It's so good to see you too, Ben, you look terrific!

I just wondered if you had gone over my speech, Ben.

... There is no longer any margin for inflation, it has gone as far as it can, you've reached your limits on taxation, dependence on foreign energy has reached a crisis, and, from where I see it, Mr. President, the Free Enterprise System has reached the breaking point. We are on the brink of another crash from which recovery might not be possible.

You're right, Mr. President I don't like feeling sorry for myself.

I'll get right to the point, Larry. I'm a puppet now...

Malkovich.

Enjoy.

What?

Is the trial date set?

Why, Craig. why?

Isn't that cute? I just taught her that.

Some sort of childhood trauma, she thinks. Possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp. Interesting, huh?

Hi.

No thanks. I'm going to turn in.

I'll meet you on the turnpike.

I have to go back.

I have to go back now.

I have to go back, Craig. Being inside did something to me. All of a sudden everything made sense. I knew who I was.

Why aren't you at work?

Why?

So how was it? What was he doing?

I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me.

I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus.

You were him last night, weren't you?

And he was with her.

I'm sorry. That was nasty.

Suck my dick!

It was lovely being you being Malkovich, my dear. I'd never seen the passionate side of sweet Maxine before, or her actual tits for that matter. If only, I've been thinking to myself, if only I could actually feel what Malkovich feels, rather than just see what he sees... And then, dare I say it, if only I could control his arms, his legs, his pelvis, and make them do my bidding.

Maybe this is what you've always been, Craig, you just never faced it before.

You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.

Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside.

You saw it once. Now you see it again. That's life, isn't it? And you were up here to try the same thing, weren't you?

Maxine...

You? Why I'm sure it would pale in comparison to the actual experience.

Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...

Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez...

Yex?

No.

No. I understand perfectly.

Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz. Why, if I were eighty years younger, I'd box your ears.

No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me.

You're making a big mistake, Schwartz.  Ma'am

Moving story.

Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.

Emily Dickinson.

And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.

Who told you?

Who told you?

That's the usual?

Hi.

Tickets to Malkovich?

Really?  But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!

Lotte, this is so good...

But I gotta go now. I've got to go be Johnny.

You've got to tell Craig what's going on. He must never leave Malkovich.

Boy, this is a toughie. To be honest, I didn't anticipate this.

Have a seat. I wracking my brain over this Malkovich thing.

Impressions? Those are hard.

How'd it go? Did you say the philodendron gets water or no?

Oh, he's good! Great, actually. I saw him do "Tru" with his sixty foot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational.

Do you dream often?

Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.

I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?

But now we've lost access to Craig.

Aaaahhhh, the portal!

Thank you all for your efforts, but I'm afraid we can no longer get into Malkovich through the portal.

I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.

Hi. Have you done Malkovich yet?

And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich, my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me.

Ah.

Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.

Maxine! Listen:  It hasn't been me in John the last three times. Craig's had me locked up in the apartment. He made me call you at gunpoint. It's been him! Oh, God, it's been him!

Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show.

What's the play?

Who's calling?

So, do you enjoy being an actor?

Something was making me talk. Some Goddamn thing was making me move. I gotta get out of here.

You still there, sweets?

Wow.  Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.

Bad dream, darling?

You've got to be kidding.

Honey, we can be happy and poor together.

Yeah what?!

Why you never go back to Lady Jone's and learn your letters? You liked going there I remember. Seeing the other children. Then all a sudden, you stop.

You blaming God. That what you're doing?

You punishing Him, ain't you?

We have to be steady. "These things too will pass". What you looking for? A miracle?

..I swallowed her blood right along with my mother's milk. She played with me and always came to be with me whenever I needed her. Me and her waited for our daddy. I love her. I do. She never hurt me. I love my mother but I know she killed one of her own, and tender as she is with me, I'm scared of her because of it. All the time, I'm afraid the thing that happened that made it all right to kill her own, could happen again. Whatever it is, it comes from outside this house, outside the yard. So I never leave this house and I watch over the yard so it can't happen again ... I have to keep it away from my sister...I'll protect Beloved...'Cause She's mine...

WATCH OUT FOR HER; SHE CAN GIVE YOU DREAMS.

WILL YOU STAY?

You don't sit with me!!

I had another dream last night.  The dead man laying on top of me and I had nothing to eat. And the ghosts without skin stuck their fingers in me and said Beloved in the dark and bitch in the light..

I want somethin' sweet.

You on your way home?

Your mother all right?

Well, good luck with the job.

What you want'em for?

I heard your mother took sick, that so?

You know what? I've been here since I was fourteen and I remember like yesterday when Baby Suggs, holy, came here and sat right where you are. Whiteman name of Garner brought her. He and Mr. Bodwin were good friends. That's how she got that house you all live in. Other things too.

I never went to those woodland services but she was always nice to me. Always. Never be another like her.

They getting older now and I can't take care of 'em like I used to. More and more they keep asking me to sleep over night. Now, I don't want to quit these people but they can't have all my days and nights too. I got my own family needs me. It'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper - take care of your mama during the day, then earn a little something at night, how's that?

Be here. In case.

Could be that fall you took.

Morning.

But mama..

Mama let me help you.

Nobody..no sir..that's right..nobody's going be doing that..nobody going be writing my daughter's characteristics on the animal side..no sir..I don't care..ain't laying that down..no sir. I refuse..that's right..that's right...

Can't locate him.

It's cold as charity in there! What he do that for? Any number'll take him in.

Anything white floating around in the woods - if it don't got a shotgun, it's something the Lord tells me I don't want no part of.

You?

He knew Baby Suggs?

But you didn't come here talking 'bout Paul. You came asking about a new girl.

I come looking for you to ask your pardon. Apologize.

You pick any house, any house where colored live. Pick any one and you welcome to stay there. I'm apologizing 'cause they didn't offer to tell you. But you welcome anywhere you want to be. My house. John and Ella. Miss Lady Jones..anybody. You choose. You ain't got to sleep in no cellar and I apologize for each and every night.

I was there Paul D...There in the yard. When she did it.

You shaved.

I'm tired, Paul. So tired. I have to rest a while.

What? What? You talking back to me?

Hey!!

I'm looking for a gal name of Judy. Works over by the slaughterhouse. Said she lived on Plank Road.

Fuck.

Here's the money, and the phone. Please, Dude, follow whatever instructions they give.

A dick, man!  And let me tell you something: I dig your work. Playing one side against the other--in bed with everybody--fabulous stuff, man.

There's no ransom if you don't have a fucking hostage.  That's what ransom is.  Those are the fucking rules.

Okay.  Vee take ze money you haf on you und vee call it eefen.

VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!  VEE TAKE YOUR MONEY!

Can we just rent it from you?

Yeah.

Sheesh.

Almost five!

Yeah Walter, what's your point?

He peed on the Dude's rug--

If what's during league play?

Burkhalter.

Oh yeah, how'd it go?

Kill that poor woman.

Fucking Germans.  Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.

Am I wrong?

Those are good burgers, Walter.

Who's in pyjamas, Walter?

Are they gonna hurt us, Walter?

I've had a--

These are Mr. Lebowski's children, so to speak--

No, they--

No.  Here.

Uh-huh.  That some kind of Eastern thing?

Wouldn't miss the semis.  How things been goin'?

Of course, you do get the good with the bad.  The new technology permits us to do exciting things with interactive erotic software.  Wave of the future, Dude.  100% electronic.

I've heard the kidnapping story, so save it.  I know you're mixed up in all this, Dude, and I don't care what you're trying to take off her husband.  That's your business.  All I'm saying is, I want mine.

No!  No!  NO!  THAT'S NOT--

Who the fuck are you?  Why've you been following me?  Come on, fuckhead!

Francis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet you.

Excuse me?

You mean coitus?

Oh, no.

Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but I don't see what it has to do with--do you have any kalhua?

Lord.  You can imagine where it goes from here.

Yeah, but my-

Oh that's okay, I hardly even--

She most certainly was not!

She is most definitely the perpetrator and not the victim.

Well...yeah--

Well yeah...I know that.

Jeffrey.

Tell me a little about yourself, Jeffrey.

I was, uh, one of the authors of the Port Huron Statement.--The original Port Huron Statement.

And then. . . let's see, I uh--music business briefly.

It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's.  Why did he think you had it?  And who does?

I keep telling you, it's the Foundation's money.  Father doesn't have any.

Yeah, okay, but see, the Dude--

This was, uh--

What's your point, Walter?

No, but--

I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian. I'm looking after it while Cynthia and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.

Hey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked me to take care of her fucking dog while she and her boyfriend went to Honolulu, I'd tell her to go fuck herself.  Why can't she board it?

Smokey my friend, you're entering a world of pain.

Walter, they're calling the cops, put the piece away.

Huh.

Anyway.  How much they offer you?

Just for making the hand-off?

I figure it's easy money, it's all pretty harmless.  I mean she probably kidnapped herself.

The what?

The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!

You didn't think I was rolling out of here naked!

That's it.  I'm out of here.

"Our" car, Walter?

It's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking know it's been stolen!

You want a toe?  I can get you a toe, believe me.  There are ways, Dude.  You don't wanna know about it, believe me.

I figure my only hope is that the big Lebowski kills me before the Germans can cut my dick off.

That makes me feel all warm inside.

What're you, a fucking park ranger now?

He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--

Is this your homework, Larry?

It is a fucking emergency.

Shit yeah!

This driveway.

It's just part of your whole sick Cynthia thing.  Taking care of her fucking dog.  Going to her fucking synagogue.  You're living in the fucking past.

Walter, you fuck!

Sure you'll see some tank battles. But fighting in desert is very different from fighting in canopy jungle.

Fuck you.  Fuck the three of you.

It's a heart attack.

Shit Dude, I'm sorry--

WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD!

Dude.

Well sir, it's this rug I have, really tied the room together-

Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug--

Is this a--what day is this?

Ah fuck it.

Is it. . . is it, being prepared to do the right thing?  Whatever the price?  Isn't that what makes a man?

Mind if I smoke a jay?

Who the hell is he?

Look at that fucking phony, Dude! Pretending to be a fucking millionaire!

<i>You'll</i> take him.

He's all yours. And I'm not your partner.

Where to first?

What was that?

I've never seen anything like this.  The Reapers are as different from us as we are from you.  It's almost as if the virus is re-wiring their bodies, creating new, parasitic organs which consume the old ones.

He's right about one thing.  We do have to survive.

Blade.

Let's just hope you've kicked the Thirst for good.  I'll be watching you close. You start to back-slide --

I agree.  We play along for now, we might wind up learning something about how their world ticks.

What's your problem, Whistler?

Come on, Blade.  Talk to me!

You got something in mind, Blade?

Oh yeah?  Like how little?  In case you hadn't noticed, we lost two men while you were out farting around.

Listen, hillbilly, you are a cunt-hair away from cowboy heaven.

We want to attract them, not scare them off.

His name is Jared Nomak.

Any casualties?

Don't try to talk --

No longer.

You're too human, Blade.

The Day Walker's blood is a disparador -- a trigger, you see? For LaMagra's return. One need only consume it and the spirit of his ancestors will settle upon him.  "And the Sleeper will rise from the shadows anew, cleansing the world in a Tide of Blood."

You shouldn't be here.

I can go to the police. I have blood samples back at the hospital. I can show them.

Like what?

What am I injecting you with?

Is he sick?

My mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart.

You don't look so good.

Get out of here --

Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.

But you -- died --

Please --

You don't have to be.

Five minutes, not a second more. And I don't want to hear a word about "us".

Tell me something, honestly, you ever have second thoughts about us?

Blade. Once again, our interests have fallen victim to his ridiculous crusade. He must be destroyed.

LaMagra isn't a physical being. He's a spirit, requiring a flesh and blood host in order to manifest himself.

You're a monster.

We keep in radio contact.

I had a family once -- a wife, three daughters. Then a drifter named Deacon Frost came calling one evening --

And now you're using Blade to exact your revenge?

I wouldn't go in there if I were you. It's best to leave him alone when he's like this.

No.

Please! Please...? I haven't done anything.

I was out hiking, camping the past two days--that's what did it--<u>I</u> killed it--

--but she was nicer then--sweeter-- she hadn't vomited twice already like today--

This is funny?? This is tens of thousands of fucking dollars!  You pricks! I'll see you in fucking court!!

No offense, sweetheart: fuck you.

Your body, your call.

You want me to scooch over next to you?

This is a goddamn disaster. Let's just pack it up and go.

What can I get you?

What'd you dream?

Then I'm going--

You're gonna owe me the rest of your life, bud.

<u>This</u> is what you wanted enhanced?

<u>One</u> set. Everything from midnight on--

My ass--you saw those four fucking baboons put 'em there!

I don't think it was them.

Okay, a blur.

So lemme see it.

And let it be known--before we even get to Burkittsville--it's gonna be an eighteen thousand times better movie--for half the cost--

You're a complete fucking idiot, aren't you?

I don't believe this.

If you're looking at me, look elsewhere.

What I never could figure about the movie?

--yeah, a hand or something--

Used to be a meat-packing plant. Slaughter on the ground floor-- carcasses schlepped up on this thing for dissection and grinding and--

Get inside quick, they'll stop.

Where?

It's <u>freezing</u>.

Hold this.

--Cotter--

Either way, maybe there's a book in it, and they both make a ton of money.

403 41st Street, kids: home.

You wanna keep it down, she's trying to sleep.

Well, she's got to be <u>somewhere</u> here.

What?

She got <u>paid</u>.

--sacred and occult Scotch Tape.

Someone want to tell me what's going on--

The four of you really have too much spare fucking time on your hands, don't you?

Women miscarry all the--

At least go drink it somewhere spilling it won't drive him to suicide.

Jesus.

What're you afraid's going to happen?

Jesus, you don't think I know that? You don't think I've tried? She won't fucking <u>go</u>-- she won't leave this place.

Heather.

You think....there could've been something up in those woods that Anna--

What?

Domini's the only logical explanation.

Gothic rune--the letter "S."

It's <u>possible</u> for chrissake--

She wants me to talk to you, Heather.

There was an accident early this morning. Another car. Your father's injuries were fatal.

Thanks, Meurice.

Jesus, I got a hangover. Want a drink?

Where... where you going?

...I can find a place tomorrow, then I'll be outta your hair.

...Well I'll be damned.

Except when he doesn't say things they're usually nasty.

Hello?

Well... what happened?

...That's what's important.

...Where is everything?

...So?

Right. Friday night is Yankee night. Where're you from?

...I don't know. Sometimes I think there's something wrong with him. Like maybe he's sick? Mentally?... Or is it maybe me, do you think?

What's the matter?

Ray. Did you mean that, what you said before, or were you just being a gentleman?

...You get a refund though, if you tell me who else she's been sluicing.

...Just doin' my job.

Now that don't make much sense.

Well what?

So, uh... this wouldn't interest you.

Yeah...

Dead, huh?

What's this?

...I thought you were dead. Going home?

Howdy stranger.

...and Abby. Maybe. But as far as I'm concerned that only leaves one fucking possibility.

Tuesday is ladies' night.

I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.

Suave. goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer?

To your health, Frank.

He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. there behind Vista, I found an ear.

Come into the study a minute.

Anything you can tell me?

Jeffrey! Come on in.

Okay. come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.

For now. Alright. you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.

Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. hurry. I'm in the apartment. hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.

Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon.  I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different.  He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.

Hello, daddy.

Who's this fuck?

Frank gone?

He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. he's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. let me wet my whistle, baby.

NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.

I made it go down the toilet.

Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.

Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.

. I. uh.

I liked being with you last night.

No. I should go.

Do you want to do bad things?  Anything. anything.

I want you to hurt me.

Come on Dorothy.

You. what?

You called me Jeffrey.

Yeah, it's me.

Where have you been?  Oh God. they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.

Who, Dorothy?

Hold me, Don.

No thanks.

What are you lookin' at?

Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?

Yeah, how did you know?

Oh yeah?

Yeah I did. treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.

What else is new?. right?

I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.

The ear is from a missing person maybe?

I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.

What happened to him?

You hungry or thirsty, or both?

I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.

So. what's next?

Yes. I do.

I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?

I already know. The "Slow Club." It's on Route 7.

I'd like an ice-cold Heineken.

Well, how did it go?. What happened?

Wow. Should you tell my father?

You saw a lot in one night.

Shoot.

You worry about me really?

Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?

You want to dance?

NO.

You want to dance?

Oh my God. What's wrong?

Probably not. no. Why?

How ya doin' Dad?

God. you scared me.

Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?

Sandy?. Could I talk to you a minute?

On the plane.

Let us walk.  From what I understand, Diego has bought a hundred and sixty acres, a marina, a hotel, and an airstrip.

The word is that soon he is to be king of the middle empire.  He is doing multiple runs right now and using the island as a jump-off point.

Yes.  Jack Stevens is already a very busy man.  Along with many others.  You shouldn't stay away so long.

No honey, I'm alright.

Alright.  I'll ask Pablo, tell him it's for you.  I don't think there will be a problem.

This is it for me.

Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself.

What, and miss all the fun?  C'mon, not a chance.  So, what's the verdict?

Tuna, this is crap.

You can't sell this to your friends.

Mr. Jung, don't you have an agreement or understanding with the United States Government in connection with your testimony in this case?

Not so fast.  I would like to go over the details.

Hmm.  I see.  Will there be clothes in the suitcase?

Whose cloths?  Your clothes?

I demand to know everything.  I do not trust six-hundred thousand dollars of coca to someone I don't know.

What the fuck is that?

Goodness.

Are you sure you want to do this in front of everyone?

I lost sight of everything.  Forgot who my friends were.

You?

George?  You better get yourself a good lawyer this time.  We're gonna nail your ass to the wall on this one.

I thought you said we were roommates. That we should talk about everything.

In my country, I am a magico.  A man with a dream.  A man on the rise.  To take nothing and make it something, okay?  I have failed my dream, but I will accomplish.  That is why I am in your country.  Yes, I lose my freedom. But they do not take my dream.  Do you have a dream, George?

Yeah, I'm out.

Who?  I need to know.  Ah, never mind. We'll talk about it later.

I'm married, George.  Me.  I can't believe it.  Can you believe I'm married, George?

Yeah, layaway.

Who's the cheapskate?

I like you, George.  You are loyal. That is good.  That is rare.  Maybe crazy.  Yes.  I can tell already.  You are like me.  I look at you and I see myself.  It's in the eyes, no, George?

I see.  I'm sorry about this, George. I'm not happy about this situation. It's bad.  You now know who your Brutus is.

There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.

May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face...

Yeah, you are.  I can tell by the way you look at me.

No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's good if it makes you happy.  It's nice to have nice things.  Are you happy, son?

Hi.

You're not going to trial?

I guess I kind of lost sight of things. "May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face, and the winds of destiny carry you aloft to dance with the stars."  Love, George.

How are you doing, George?

Figured it out.

What the fuck are you talking about, man?

Hello.

I don't know.  My name is George.

Jesus Christ.

Where are you going?

No, that's alright.

There's a fucking cop behind us, Mirtha. Be cool, will ya.

What?

I haven't seen one dollar from you.  You haven't paid me one cent in child support, alimony.

Is she here?  Is she coming?

Well, here I am.  See?

What do you want from me?

But I have a visitor.

Mr. Jung, do you know Diego Delgado?

You're looking at him.  We provide the plane, transportation cost, U.S. landing spot, and take it to wherever you want it to go.  You provide the pick up point in South America, and are responsible for payment.  You assume all the bust risks.  We take sixty-five percent of all transportation fees, ten percent of the gross, plus our expenses. This is not a negotiation, so if this is okay with you, we can talk further.  If not, we can forget we had this conversation.

Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well.  We must be careful.

It's not enough.

Okay.  So we need a source.  Where do we start?

This is bullshit, George.  We're never going to find anything down there.

It is an inevitable stage in revolutionary war; from terrorism, one passes to insurrection ... as from open guerrilla warfare one passes to real war, the latter being the determining factor ...

In Indochina, <U>they</U> won.

Excuse me, colonel. I have the impression that perhaps due to excessive prudence ... my colleagues continue to ask the same allusive questions, to which you can only respond in an allusive manner. I think it would be better to call things by their right names; if one means torture, then one should call it torture.

You afraid of these ...?

How much are they paying you?

What ... What must I decide?

With an unloaded pistol?

What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.

And how many are we?

It's better to split up, to increase our chances. We must change hiding places, and change them continually ... In the meantime, we must make new contacts, replace our arrested brothers, reorganize our sections--

Good, thank you, Corbiere... . See you tomorrow.

How you doin' Mister D?

I would have missed it -- but the phone rang and I let it play while I talked.  It looks like blank tape -- but it isn't.  It's been erased without any input signal coming in.

Here it is!  According to the old will Joanne Braslow was to inherit two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

Take some time off.

You did a good job, Charlie.

What about the will?

What are you saying, Henry?  That his girlfriend fucked him to death?

What can we prove?

Cocaine is the last thing a man in his condition would want.

Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?

What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love?

Mrs. Crawford, you were Mr. Marsh's maid for nine years?

What did they argue about?

Did they argue the day before he died?

Why would she want that?

Your Honor, this is a tape from Miss Lawson's answering machine.  I would like to play it now.

Objection, Your Honor.  The fact that Mrs. Crawford heard Mr. Troxell reconstruct her sentence and decided to rephrase her words in a more intelligent manner for the court doesn't mean the incident never happened.

What's happening to you, Frank? You're acting like you're on trial here.  This has become personal to you.

That's ridiculous.

Objection!

Objection!  May I remind Mr. Dulaney that the person on trial here is Miss Lawson -- not Dr. Paley.

Did you use it the night Marsh died?

Why did you come by?

Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?

Did you talk about Miss Lawson?

Is it Marsh?

Doctor Trammel, when did you first diagnose that Mr. Marsh had heart disease?

Did Mr. Marsh change his lifestyle after that?

What happened next?

And how are you now?

She told me that tonight we were going to open new doors.  I asked her to stop -- to take off the handcuffs, but she wouldn't listen.

Yes.

She was.

What eventually happened to your relationship with Miss Lawson?

-- And what did you suggest?

Yes.

You'll be sorry?

I may have been infatuated with her - - but I wouldn't perjure myself.

Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to Miss Lawson about his illness?

Did you go to college, Mrs. Crawford?

High school?

No.

Where did you meet him?

What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.

What happened next?

What about Miss Lawson?

How do you know it was cocaine that Miss Lawson had in the bathroom?

Yes -- he mentioned it.

Yes.

No.

Yes.

And you resented that he cared for her in a way he once cared for you?

P.M.

Would it be fair to say that when she did find out it was a shock to her?

You must have some feeling.  Some immediate impression.  A young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will.  And the things that went on in that house.  Such wild sex.  What kind of picture does that paint?

Frank!

Something like that.

I think we're getting a little off the subject here.

How?

Can we get out of here?

Why not?

Is it against the law?

What do you think?

I'm the photographer.

That's not an answer.

Nothing.

Hello?

Did you always want to be a lawyer?

Really?

I just left Joanne Braslow.  She told me she saw you doing cocaine at Marsh's house!

I called you all weekend.  Where were you?

Alone?

I'm sure you'll be able to handle him.

Don't worry about Paley.  He can't touch me.  No one can.  I've thought it all out.

Rebecca -- take these off.

Rebecca -- we shattered a man's life in open court.

So, sue me.  Things have changed.  I think you should go home -- and after you leave I see no reason for us to ever have contact again.

No -- he's lying.

Michael -- get off the phone.

Because I'm expecting a call.

The witness will answer the question.

You're on vacation, remember?  You're supposed to be relaxing.

If you want me to.

Hello?... Hi Raymond.... What?... Well, I was sort of planning on... Alright... Okay, goodbye.  That was Sattler.  He thinks the D.A.'s going to file on Rebecca Lawson.  He wants me in the office tomorrow morning.

How can Cardenas possibly think he can build a case against two consenting adults?

Humped

This isn't a courtroom.  Don't try to turn this around on me.

I was thinking that when the trial is over we'd all go skiing for a weekend.

You think that's the answer?  Sex? Is that what you want?  You want me to make love to you?

I didn't know that Andrew was dead until Mr. Sattler called me at home that night.

Yes.

No, we just had lunch at the hotel with my brother and his new wife. She told me all the dirt. I forgot how interesting things can get around here. It was so good to see them. The last time we visited they were in Europe. He is doing so well. He ordered champagne. For lunch! I nearly died.

Well, why don't I just say black so you can say white!  Don't be surprised to find your brother hasn't changed an iota. He hardly ever talks and when he does it's in that tone! You should have heard him at lunch -- not two words until the bill came and then he says, "Worth every penny."

You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!

Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.

I don't mind waiting.

How bizarre!

Oh, just a old letter from a friend.

What's he saying now?

What?

DAMN HIM! I knew mama wouldn't have thought of that herself. It was some damn perverted... photographic mind influencing her! When did the bastard die?

Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?

Don't say that!

Well, I'd like to read them.

He's getting her drunk. That's what happened. Jesus, maybe he forced himself. That's why she couldn't tell us.

Nobody did.

See. Money don't buy happiness. I must say, she's taking it well.

Oh, this heat! Times like this I wish we took that offer from your brother and moved on up to Michigan.

Not this kind of heat.

Well, nobody put a gun to his head.

I can't describe it. I think it's from the loam in the soil. This very rich, earthy kind of... alive... No. No, that's not right. Can you smell it?

Oh.

Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari.

No, really?

So, how long you've been living here?

Oh there you are.

Are you by nature a sadistic person?

Oh, that's nice.

Mind if I smoke?

Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a change.

He's very... clean.

Would you like to stay for dinner?  There aren't many choices in town and ... anyway, you'd have to eat alone. So would I.

You sound like an artist.

Francesca?

So what happened?

Woman friends, too?

You really don't need anyone?

Do you ever regret not having a family?

No, I'm just saying --

My mistake. I apologize.

Oh. I guess you got the whole story.

Yeah?

Fine. They're all having a good time. How many more shots do you have?

Can I help?

You want to eat something?

And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!

Where? Near the doorway or the near the front of the church?

Why do you say that?

But you don't mind.

I just wondered. Why were you trouble?

You're somewhere else, where?

Where was she?

Am I too heavy for you?

I was honest with you. I told you who I was.

I told you! I won't apologize for who I am.

I won't be made to feel like I've done something wrong.

If I've done anything to make you think that what's happened between us is nothing new for me -- is some routine -- then I do apologize.

It's a Chicago station. I found it the other day.

Franny?

Are you seeing Betty tonight?

Okay.

About an hour ago.

Take my advice.  And shoot that dog.  Or let me.

Oh yeah, I guess this would be that space that was so perfect for a recording studio.

Can you take a little extended solo right about now, funk soul brotha?

Shit.

Don't poison your mind with that ghetto paranoia.  That's all just ways of people justifying their own failure.

Looking to score?

Hey, Eddie Mack don't like no wackos on his street.  Go be Rain Man on some other bitch's block.

But a two dollar bet is cheaper than a twenty-dollar bag.

I ain't interested.  And if you gonna sell it, don't sell it round here.

Let me see your hand.

Left hand's the past.  Your right's the present.  And the future.  But it's not written in stone.  It's written in flesh and blood.  And flesh and blood will change.  See?  There's something here, a new line, right across your life line.

Jimmy, you've got --

It's all arranged for tonight.  Eddie Mack's gonna be there.  And Offisa Korruptsky, too.

Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this.  Not just big.  BIG.  Like big business big.  Big corporation big.  Big government big.  Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands.  Nothing but net.

Aren't you going to join us?

You got a vision, girl.  Just like I got. Just like my momma had.  And the good Lord didn't give you that vision just for painting pretty pictures.  That's just wasted time.

If he was trying to kill you, you'd be dead.

Told you so.  Alright.  We tried.  Let's go home.

Lucky thing.

She doesn't want me here.  With you.  In this house.

No, I want to stay with you guys.  But I can't.  I mean I'm not ready.

Where is it?

Bullshit, Dad.  Don't front me.  For once.  Just tell me the truth.  I came from there, too.

I saw your face.  You knew that place. You knew those people.

Nice rack.  How old is --

No way man...

What it is?  What it will be, muthafucka.

I thought you were bringing the Colonel?

"Like a heartbeat/Like a love beat." Listen to the Di Franco twins there. Just the plumbing or something, fool.

You look mighty familiar to me.  You sure you're not from around here?

There wasn't any draft.  That window was closed.

Admit what?

So, you just got out?

Caesar, what happened?

Where the hell's the laundry detergent?

Fuck!  Fuck!  How did you ...  Awwww goddammit!

What?

Why?  Why would Johnnie do this?

I hate that little fuck!  I hate him!  I hate him!  I should've done him!

Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just leave me the fuck alone!  Please! Leave!  Now!

I need you ...

It's not here, Caesar.

Don't try to tell me what to do.

You murdered Gino!

What?

I want what's mine, half the money. We get rid of Mickey, no one else dies.  No one.  Say yes, I understand.

How's it going tonight, fellas?

Now why don't you go watch some TV or something?

Yeah?

I was buzzing, I was knocking, but I guess you couldn't hear me on account of being in the shower.

Actually, yeah, she was nervous about Gino coming, wanted everything to look right.  You know women, Mick.

Un-fucking-believable.  I called those highway patrol dumb fucks.

We had a report of gunfire, so if you could --

This is a beautiful place.

Truck.

Do you know him?

Oh no.  Shit.  I didn't know he would call you.  God, you must think |I'm a total nuisance.

I'm sorry, look, forget it.  I shouldn't have called...

Are you surprised that I know what it is?

You dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you?

...  I needed that.

Caesar's Mafia, isn't he?

How long have you been with him?

You didn't have to tell me if you didn't want to.

We're not that different, Corky.

I know what I am.  I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.

Yes.

These people are serious, Violet. If you want to know how serious, ask Shelly.  They're worse than any cop because they have lots of money and no rules.  You fuck them, you've got to do it right.

All right, let's say for the moment that I believe everything you are saying.

And where is it now?

And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone?

What happened?

And as you do, the bottle will slip from your hands.  -- and shatter against the hardwood floor.

I still don't see how I'm going to get clean with the money in the apartment.  Everyone will think I did it.

Believes it!  Jesus, it's driving him crazy.  He wants to kill him.  I don't know, Corky, I don't know what he is going to do.  I'm getting nervous, really nervous.

I was so afraid you ...

You know what the difference is between us, Violet?

Mickey!  Oh God, Mickey!

Yes.

She's a gypsy.  If it's a cover, it's a great one.

<u>This is an operations desk</u>.

No.  We can't risk it.

I'm going to Paris.

You're not doing shit.  You're so scared you can't even think.

What do you mean?

Paris.  I live in Paris...

You're a U.S. Citizen?

You have your passport?

Kane.  Do you have Mr. John Michael Kane?

His brother.  You know his brother?

It's very bad this.  Terrible sad. Such a young man.

Mr. Kane...  Come right in...please...have a seat.

I need a ride.

I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris.

Jesus...

So what's in Paris?

Just so you know, if you're gonna burn me on the money, you might as well kill me.  I was supposed to have this car back three days ago.  It's not my car.

Shit --  Can I tell you how much you're freaking me out?  Okay?  Because you are -- you're completely freaking me out.

No.  No, I mean, I really don't know who I am.  I can't remember anything earlier than two weeks ago.  I'm serious.

Lots of people have guns.  You're American.  Americans love guns.

Where?

I should go.

Look, you could come up.  Or you could wait if you want.  I could go check it out.  You could wait.

-- no -- Marie -- <u>no</u>! -- it's not like that --

He had my picture!  He knew I was here!  He came here to kill us!

-- we'll explain it --

I found it.  It took six calls.  I found Kane.  I found the body.

What about you?

-- Miss Kreutz, please --

It's an angle of the street -- some sort of alleyway -- you can just...

Tell him we're busy.

What?

-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --

It's not much, but it should get you to Switzerland.

...ergency procedures.

...your ducts?

You telephone, sir.

Trouble with your air-conditioning.

I think we'd better have a look.

Central Services don't take kindly to sabotage!

...ven't you?

But the bombing campaign is now in its thirteenth year ...

Thanks very much Sam.

I'm not a terrorist! You must know that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of here!

Remember how they used to stick out?

You clever bastard! I might have guessed. You only moved in today and you're already hot on the bloody trail.

Christ! You do know it all!

Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but Buttle's heart condition did not appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think I'm dismissing this business, Sam. I've lost a week's sleep over it already.

There are some real bastards in this department who don't mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but thank God there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication. We've got the upper hand for the moment, but they're waiting for us to slip up, and a little slip- up like this is just the chance they're looking for.

What I've got to do now is pick up Tuttle, interrogate him at the same voltage as Buttle, to the same meter reading to the last penny, and juggle the books in electrical banking.

Er ... no.

Look, about the Layton woman - maybe she's just trying to help the Buttle family.

Why? Hell, not for any reason ...

So what are you going to do about her?

Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her.

Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch.

Come off it, Jack! Of course you can check to see if she's been arrested.

You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league?

Jack, I'm innocent! Help me.

You stupid bastard!

How do you think I feel? You shit!

I want to report a wrongful arrest.

Yes.

But you've stamped this form before! Why won't you stamp it now?

You think these are tits don't you?

Ow! That hurt!

Why not?

It does doesn't it?

What are you doing in Information Retrieval?

We've got both.

Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.

Turn around!

Will you please turn back.

We? Don't blame me!

Jill! What are you do ... I mean ... how did you ... Are you alright?

Don't you like parties?

Thanks for the vote of confidence.

It's your mother isn't it? Pulling strings again.

Try next of kin.

Problem. She doesn't have a bank account.

Of course, of course. Leave it to me. How do I authorize a cheque?

That's it.

Damn! Blast!

I've go to accept that promotion to get behind this, haven't I?

I know her age and distinguishing marks. But I need an address or a place of work or something

It seems you're the first person ever to turn down a promotion. He thinks you should see a doctor.

Actually, there's someone I want to meet ...

Here we are! I'm going to leave you two lovebirds in peace.

I can't make up my mind whether to have a number one or a number two. What do you recommend, Spiro?

Numero huit, braised veal in wine sauce. 

That's all right Ida ... it's just that he's such an artist. To him, cutting is so crude ... so primitive.

Hello - Central Services - I'm at 579B Block l9, Northwestern Section D - that's exit 1 on Green Pastures Highway at the Orange Blossom Flyover - and I've got trouble with the air- conditioning

But I could be anybody.

And you can't tell me what the proper channels are, because that's classified information?

I mean it fixed itself.

What?

Hang on! Wait a minute! You can't just go and leave it like this!

For God's sake, what's happened?

Sorry. wouldn't it be easier just to work for Central Services?

I've never fired anyone in my life.

Nobody tells me to fire anyone. I told them: shove it up the big one.  Sorry.  I said, you want to fire him, come over and do it yourself.

I feel for you, but we got an emergency here. It's a weekend of full moons.  Everyone's called in sick. Larry, Veeber, Stanley too. We need bodies out there. I had to put Marcus on Twelve Young. You know he's not supposed to work two nights in a row.

Es impossible.

In that time, you ever have sex?

Hey Cy, guess who's here?

She asked me to pick her up.

That shit is poison, Frank. We don't drink alcohol here. What you need is one of these.

Is this what you gave Mary?

I guess I'll be going.

They're gonna torch the fence. You're gonna feel the metal getting warm, maybe very warm.

All right, all right, he's been snorting that Red Death stuff. Been going for four days.

Noel, you didn't let me finish. We have rules against killing people on the street. Looks bad, but there's a special room at the hospital for terminating. A nice quiet room with a big bed.

Here, you try.

It's my first cigarette in over a year.

It's the waiting that's killing me, not knowing, you know? It's really hard on my mother. The doctor doesn't think my father'll make it. He says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door.

That boy you brought in, he was shot, wasn't he?

Did you see my father?

My father's in a coma, now my mother's going crazy. It's like she's in a trance.

On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?

It's been bad lately, but it's always bad.

You learn to sort of block it out, you know, like cops fence off a crime scene. But then something good will happen and everything will just glow.

Excuse me. You seemed like you were in trouble.

No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.

You ever notice people who see shit always, are crazy?

He's not dead. It's a heroin overdose. Break out the Narcon.

Look at that. A fat junkie. That's a first.

Three legs.

You know what I'm talking about. It's all over your face. That I-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look.

That guy I brought in yesterday, post-cardiac arrest. He's gone.

Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours.

He's dead, Rose. Your father passed.

He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry.

Would you like to come in?

It's not worth it, Tom. He's surrendering.

Our mission is coffee, Tom. A shot of the bull, Puerto Rican espresso.

Where you going?

Whadda we bring?

Oh no!--I just remembered.

I'm so stupid. I had beef lo mein last night. I can't eat the same thing two nights in a row. It's almost two o'clock, what the hell am I gonna do? What you getting?

Turn it off.

Tell me, you ever think of doing anything else?

Jesus, Tom Walls, that crazy motherfucker.

You're in the stomach! Let me try.

Hi, Aaron...What's doing?

What did I do to you?

Never to pretend to know more than I did.

This is uncomfortable for me -- because, well, I don't mean it as a knock, but we approach this differently.

No.  No.

You packing up tonight?

Hold it down, okay?

I'm just bringing him over to give Jane a look at him --

Okay.

It's Mr. Buddy Felton?

Last time Paul was sick they gave Connie the weekend news instead of me.

Me too...Hey...if it gets dull a little before 11:00, drop by the studio.

How'd it go?

Then what was good about it?

Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.

What?

You can't end up with Tom because it goes totally against everything you're about.

I've got to not say that aloud; it takes too much out of me.

Tell me the God's honest truth -- are you leaving because of me? Because if you are...

So who's the guy?

Ready.

Okay.

Oh, you mean use him...That's nice.  Okay.

I saw the smile -- good piece.

Oh, I was just writing you a note. What do you say we take a walk?

We know each other well enough for me to care how I put something to you which could wipe you out. So I will phrase things the way I think they should be phrased.  All right?

Do it then.

Norman Rockwell's enduring portrait of a <u>Homecoming</u>  The return of a fighting man has always been one of the more moving ceremonies of war... Tearful women, proud men, excited children.  But J.D. Singer was right -- his homecoming was no big deal.

But thanks.

You don't have time.  Not a chance.

Tell George and Jessica to try and cover everything without Tom having to ask additional questions.

They're not really going to call security are they?

Forgive me, but it really is intoxicating being a news source.

I wish it were you giving the story.

What?

How horrible.  We'll be fine.  You'll be fine.  Stay here with me -- we'll go for a drive, have some drinks, make happy plans.

Bye, sweetie.

...am starting to get jealous. I read in the newspapers about the Italian strike and riots in Milan.  I hope you weren't...

Thanks, Dad, this talk helped.  Will you sign it, please?

Hi.

Listen to me.  You keep on thinking I'm somebody ho lacks...confidence. That's not it.  I know I can talk well enough and I'm not bad at making contact with people, but I don't like the feeling that I'm pretending to be a reporter.  And half the time I don't really get the news I'm talking about.  It isn't that I'm down on myself.  Trust me, I stink.

But that didn't stop me from sending out audition tapes to bigger stations and the networks.

I can't help you, sorry.  I'm not here to teach remedial reporting.

I didn't think you'd make it.

Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.

No.  Were you going to you?

Maybe I'll get off work.  I'd like to go.

Suppose I go in for a little while and you wait in the lobby-bar.  How's that?

You okay?

I was half hoping I wouldn't have a good time tonight.  You know why?

I don't remember saying anything like that -- exactly...I don't know why I just did.

Hi, again.  Sorry about...

Uh-huh.

No.  Did he really?

What?

Well, I just think that' an extraordinary proposal.

Why?

We disagree on how God-awful it was.  Why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time?

I don't wan to discuss work.

So he bought this Peugeot sedan at a greatly reduced price while he was there in charge of the White House Advance Team.

Would you like to do me?

If you were an artist you could have created something!

Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!

Not really.  One girl who fit the descrip came in, kinda skinny, brunette, didn't see much changing hands.

Don't worry about him...what have you got?

You really like it?

Oh, I don't know.  Smart people. Creative people I guess.

- even though Leonard's always asking you to go out with him and I - just -

Because...  We're just friends.  That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it.  I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!

Would you really like to?  That would make me very happy.

Walter...stay away from me!

Walter...I can't believe it.

I'm trying to find a style of my own.  Do you really like them?

Yeah, I'm feeling a lot better.

What's wrong with you, why do you want to hide it?

It will take years to make that many statues.  But your work would be featured.

Would you pose for me for free?

Now what kind of statue was that?

Man look at that get up !

Where'd ya buy that?

Well...why did you put a knife in it?

Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.

Hiya Carla.

Listen to me...I don't want to lose this piece -

Yes, you have.  Can I come in?

I also saw the girl give you this.

You're in some deep shit pal, whether you know it or not.

But I got a feeling you're gonna cooperate with me.  Yessir, I think you and me are gonna be real good friends.  Why don't you tell me about your connection.

Wait a minute - I told you I didn't do nothing wrong!

You're gonna shoot me!

Are you done with these?

Wheat germ omelette, guava nectar and garbanzo sprinkled with smoked yeast.  Join us?

An' everyone will say Walter let me shake your hand...it's a real pleasure to have known you...

I won't say good luck, Walter.

I get it Walter.  I get it.

With Dead Cat.  Like a breath of fresh air.  I could just - babble on about it for hours.

Let me into your world Walter... let me into that white hot inspired world.

Well, I'll go home with you.

I don't think so Mayolia.

Straightening up indeed!  Are you sure you're not alone?

She doesn't have to be pretty... just as long as she takes good care of you...

Well, um... litter?

Whoa!  Whoa!  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. I don't actually need any right now.

Don't grab me, okay?

No, we didn't.

Hey!  She wasted my dog!

They're all the same!  They're so stuck up, they're just... they're not even human.  I hate them.

I'm fine.

Let me in, Pike!  I'm hungry!

Are there any good sicknesses that aren't too depressing?

Hey, I was thinking, for the dance, what about a big sign that says 'Don't Tread On Me'.  You know, and a picture of the earth.

He doesn't look fifty.

Buffy, honey?

Have you gained a few pounds?  Maybe it's that outfit...

Well... it's possible they think my name's Bobby.

Oh.  Who's in it?  I know what it is.  It's what's on instead of the movie.

Are you going out with Jeffrey tonight?

Where were you last night?  I called your house like four times.

Ah, my fool is dead.  He was careless, always.  Still, I'll pull out your tongue for that.  Don't you understand?  I've killed you a dozen times.  Your life is not a blink of my eye, not a single breath.  I have lived in the shadows, in the pulsing filth behind men's eyes.  A thousand years, and more. I have conversed with the worms that fed on my corpse and I have bathed in the blood of emperors.

This?  This is you only weapon? Your puny faith?

How are you doing?

It's weird.  I went back to my old grade school once, to the playground -- I used to hang out there all the time, playing on the swings and stuff... I went back and it was so tiny, the whole place.  I couldn't even fit on the swings.  Everything just looked so small.  I'm sorry.  I'm babbling.

You sure?

Thanks.

I been working on some stuff for you.  What'cha doing?

Leave me alone.

That's me.

You're staying here.  Some of them might not come after me.  If they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain.

Good thing one of us was prepared.

I didn't say it was a bad idea, I just said the timing was off.  We could maybe wait till later.

I really can't.  Besides, it's pretty interesting.

Beverly Center.

Let's meet tonight, okay?

You were supposed to be here at three.

Buffy, what is your sitch?  You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax-Bracket; it's too weird.

What are you talking about?

Everybody does.

How do you know all this?

I can't believe I'm doing this.  I can't believe I'm in a graveyard with a strange man hunting for vampires on a school night.

Wait a minute.

Oh, him.

I still don't get how they happened to come to my town.  I mean, was I born here because... because they were coming here?  That Lothos guy, and his buddies?

Here?

Oh.  Sorry.

Put your head back.

Toasty.  Were there ever any, like, famous vampires?

Same one.

What!?!

Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is - PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks for telling me.

Do you know how many girls I've trained to be Slayers?  Five.  Five properly prepared girls, girls who faced their responsibilities, who worked hard to become women overnight -- harder than you've ever worked in your life -- and I saw them ripped apart.  Do you want to live?  Do you?

I want to die.

So, is Jeffrey really spending the night at your house?

I don't get it.

Hey, Buffers.  You look thrashed.

Hi, guys.

So very much.

Listen, you little worm.  I could beat your head to a pulp for you, just like I did last year, you got that?  You got that?

Oh, yes!  Yes!

She was even crazier after that.  I mean it, you wouldn't even have recognized her.

God!  Take a chill lozenge.

No...  You want me to give him a message?

Hey.  What should I do if I see Benny?

You mean Nuke.  You said "Crash".

Yeah maybe you're right.

The right nostril.  Good.

The ida originates at the right testicle and terminates at the left nostril.

God...I think I'm gonna be sick--

Fundamentals?

No!  You're playing with my mind!

I knew it--you're seducing me!

We lost.

Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh--don't think too much.

Omigawd, honey, I'm so happy for you.

Don't tell anybody.

Your place or mine?

You're gorgeous, God damn it! From the moment I first saw you I knew I had to have you.  I had to have you!

Who are you?  Do you have a job?

And now you wanta teach me?

--and as soon as we lose a game, he'll be back in your arms.

God damn you--what is happening? Is there no man who'll have me?  This is the weirdest season I ever saw--the Durham Bulls can't lose and I can't get laid!

Why baseball?

I'm quitting too.  Boys, not baseball.

Ebby's told me a lot about you.

Let's have a quick word of prayer, right here, to thank the Lord for all this--

Sweetie, have you ever heard of Walt Whitman?

Will that work for me?

Don't bump me.

Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!

Hey!  What're you guys doing here-- stealing my girl?

Fun?  What's he know about fun?  Why's he calling for a curveball? I wanta bring heat.

How come you don't like me?

What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?

I was playing naked.

Write this down.  "We gotta play 'em one day at a time."

Club's expanding its roster to finish the season--

Settle what?

No.  Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, not ignorance!

Well, I got Annie all warmed up for ya...  She's just waiting for you to show up, y'know...

Nuke--  Good luck.

Crash Davis?

I'd kill ya.

No.  If I screw up, I wanta do it alone.  I'll call.

No.

The organization wants to make a change...now that Nuke's gone they wanta bring up some young catcher...

What'you want, kid?

Thank you.

...was gonna stop what came up next at the casino.

Hi, Ace.

You were wandering around.

You know damn well I was at that dinner, and you swore to me that I would have a fair hearing at that dinner! Did you not?! Did you not?!  Well, tell me I was at least at the dinner! A-allow me that much.  Give me that much at least!

He's on all night, screamin' about how he's gonna take his damn lawsuit all the way to the Supreme Court. He really must be crazy. He's gonna go to Washington with this?  He's out of his fuckin' mind.

First of all, what they did was totally unconstitutional. We're already on the list to be heard before the Supreme Court of the United States later this year.

...stupid things.

But one thing I could never understand, was that she could have everything under control, except for her old pimp boyfriend, Lester Diamond.

Sam, let me ask you a question. You must really trust your wife.

Oh. Have a good day at school.

Hello? Hello! Ginger.

Amy! Amy, open the door!

...give him a shot at runnin' a casino and he tries to talk you out of it.

But nobody had to take care of Nicky.

Ohh!

When I married Ginger I knew all the stories, but I didn't give a fuck. 'I'm Sam Rothstein,' I said. 'I can change her.'

All right, Ace?

Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants. He was a real restaurant buff. And over the years, he always made money with them.

No, no it's okay.

...very difficult to get in.

Hey, Ace.

...okay? I just wanna run a square joint. That's it. I just want my license. I want everything nice and quiet. That's it.

What happened to me? What happened to you?

Now, what does she have to do with all this?

All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?

Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that.

I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it.

Your fuckin' ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television!  You wanted to go on TV.

Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?

She was afraid to call you.

She didn't know who to turn to.  She... she didn't know where to turn. She was tryin' to save your marriage.

Mr Rothstein...  I'm Pat Webb.

Hey, house is doin' well.  Hey, all that money is rollin' in. I appreciate you takin' the time to see a poor ol' civil servant.

It's always been our policy -

I had dozens of politicians and state officials comin' through that place every week.

This woman's an institution.

To Abraham Lincoln.

Yeah, Billy Sherbert, please. Put him on.

Okay, thank you for asking.

...she took care of the valet parkers, the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything.

What, are you trying to handicap me?

You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.

If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?

Why're you crying?

Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.

Right?

Well, if you want a coat, you got it. You know that. It's not the money, it's just why do you want it?  That's all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to that?

Yes, you do. It's very discreet. There's no names in the papers. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff.

How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  You can do it.  You can do it.

I mean she's only sober about two hours a day. It's usually from eleven in the morning until one in the afternoon. And if I gave her her money and her jewels now, you know what she's gonna do? She's gonna piss it all away in about a year, and then where will she be?  Where would you be then? Comin' right back to me, right back to me.  Or finding some other excuse to come and I - I -

Well, that's why I'm here. She wants to come back, but she's afraid you're gonna whack her out.

What I mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if I came back... do you think you could forgive me?

Right.

So, what'd ya do with it?

The good part was, I had Amy back. So, we went home, had the housekeeper stay over, put the kid to bed, I calmed myself down and we went to dinner. I tried to keep things nice and civil, you know.  But... hey, twenty-five thousand for three suits? That doesn't make much sense.

Plus, at the most, three suits, a thousand apiece. That still leaves what?  Around ten thousand?

Get off of me! Stop it!

I want you out of here! I want you out of here!

I am. I'm wakin' her up right now.

Why do you want to do that?

I just want the key to my jewelry, and I want you to let me go.

If she calms down, I will let her in the house.

...'Ace' Rothstein, accused the state's top gaming officials of corruption.

No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please.

Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me?

Yes, there is. An infallible way! They won!

I had my license hearing coming up and I didn't wanna leave anything to chance.

No.

Look what they did to my hand, man!

Excuse me.

When I left here with the money...

A couple of guys, I owe them. So, that's what I did. I gave 'em the money.  That's what I did.

Hey... you got a minute? Hey. He's got two million in the box, am I right?  Okay, you let him keep your jewels. We take the cash and the only other thing he cares about.  Huh?  Her majesty. We go to Europe. You dye your hair, get some pl-

You gotta go back out there.

You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.

So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.

Yeah.  I think I want my money back.

Mrs Ro- Mrs Rothstein! Okay, shh!

I'm just trying to get in my house!

There's nothing we can do. She had the key.

Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You mind accompanying us outside?

Fuck you! Fuck you!

Is that what you did?

I had my kid brother, Dominick, run it for me.

He's not here?

Hey, Nicky, how are you? What are you doin' here?

I think, you know, maybe he went across the street or somewhere else or somethin'. I don't know.

...I want all the names of all the other people he had with him. And I don't care what you have to do to him to get 'em. You understand?

And I mean... that's no good.

What could I say? I knew if I gave the wrong answer, I mean, Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of 'em could've would up gettin' killed.

Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky.

You see... I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for people who are our friends. You understand?

Ace.

T'aggia parla. [Italian-American slang for 'I've got to talk to you'] Nicky... See that guy? 

Hi, Jennifer.

Oh, you did? I didn't know that.

Well, there you go. But what does that tell ya? A million dollars in jewelry. Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what?

He didn't have to hit him. It's not exactly like I'm sleepin' with the guy! And he makes me sneak around to see my own friends! What the fuck is that all about?

He gives a fuck what I do?

Thanks.

See who I got in there. Gotta get somebody I can trust.

No, he's not.

I'm not as tough as you think I am.

I'm not and he scares the shit out of me. I never know what he's gonna do.

Nicky, please...

Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Ah, you fuck! You're such a fuckin' asshole!

So, what'd you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway?

I'm sorry.

Don't give me that shit. I want my money.

I'm always here for you.

...all the luck in the world.

What does that mean? No, I know that look. What does that mean?

Just knock it off! Would you two knock it off? Get in the car.

You're not gonna drive. Don't even think you're gonna drive.

- back to  Nigeria.  Yeah.

They checked in alone.

There's more! There's a couple stuck in there. I know there's more.

Hey, how you doin'? 

Incredible.

How many of these you gonna eat, huh?

...you big fuckin' hick, you. Come here. Come here. Get him up. Come here.

Sometimes I used to go along on a heist just for the fun of it. But I didn't like the people I was rippin' off lookin' at me, so I used to turn their fuckin' pictures around.

Whenever we got local merch, we'd usually send it to Palm Spring or Arizona... LA. I had a couple of sand niggers out there. You know, Arabs.

I actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault where I kept the choice stuff.

Fine. Everything's goin' good.

Yeah, but they're complaining.

He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.

I know. I know.

And when I'm ready, I'll say the words, 'Go see the Jew.'

Don't know.

Frankie! Frankie, you piece of shit!

My fuckin' head.

...this, uh, this Commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the Rothstein application.

Since when do you talk like that?

Again!

That's enough.

...done right, you gotta do it yourself.

Hi.

Hey, Hot Stuff. You're still on the clock...

Oh Man, not the sewer, I just had this cape cleaned...

Works for me.

I despise these kind of winds. Sorry, I guess I'm a little on edge. Seems this Catwoman has everyone, men and women, on edge. Don't you feel Catwoman says something about the duality of all men and women...

Selina, did you make it home, all right?  I tried calling, but your mother said that there was "no extension in the Hut." Whatever that means..

Exactly. I don't know what I'd do without you.

This ring belonged to my sister. I'd love for you to...

A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?

I can. That's not an admission of guilt,  It's just..I knew you had it in you...

I've been looking for you.

Oh Honey, it's so much better when we do it without the helmet.

Pass!

The shopkeeper on 13th street won't drop the lawsuit--He still claims one of the lasers we fired at the Jenkins gang burned down his store..

Cactus--shooting a man in the back is not very noble.

Sorry man, I didn't mean that personally...

Well, we spent enough time building the damn thing, might as well use it.

You like them, don't you, Boss.

Why are you--I fought for you with honor.  Why should it matter if I'm a man or a woman, as long as I'm a good warrior.

I loved you.

Hasn't anyone ever taught you that fighting violence with violence solves nothing.

I'm a good mother!

You're late. I've got some good news and some good news. I'm giving you more hours and the new uniforms came in.

Hey, you're anti-male.

Oh the hand--my grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender and..You know, I realize I've never officially introduced myself...I'm Lewis Lane.

Some reporter I am..all this time my story is right there in front..I have a lot of questions.

Okay, deal.

Where were you last night?  I didn't hear you come in.

I don't know if I can do it alone.

Any place.

I know.  But it's an emergency. Somebody dying.  Okay?

So what?  What could be important enough to put your hands on me?

Say something ...

I'm trying to help somebody. Okay?

He's right, Theo.  She might not be around to back up your story. You could end up in the middle of this.

You gotta just look the other way.

Are you guys all right?

We've already got an ambulance on the way.  Don't try to get out.

Let's have your license, mister.

Yeah, I suppose getting whacked has got to be one of your best ways to die.  Particularly if you're not expecting it.  You don't know what hit you.

You switched license plates?

We have never worked a gig together but I am a firm believer in preparation.  So let's go over this again step by step.

That's your "rep."

If you know that just back off.

First off, this Mr. Chow Yen doesn't speak a lot of English. The girl with him will interpret. There will be a third person to accompany you into the men's room where you can take count.  I hope you know Krugerands better than they know a <u>Hockney</u>.

Don't fuck around.  Pop a cap in him.

Nels?

We've had our share of fuck-ups but it's going to work out fine.

Do I know you?

If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --

Don't expect me to tell you who I am.

Where'd they take you to?

Okay.  The police are gonna need your full name and address.

Who?

Stop throwing names at me.

What do they need her for?

Why isn't anyone answering me?

Where's the fucking recharger cord?  Must be in her car, dammit.

I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.

I suppose if you're a struggling artist you need a patron.

I have no right to ask for help. I've never thought of anybody but myself.

There are cables overhead.  Hang on.  It'll clear up.

Wait just a minute.  Our luck has changed.

They've still got to be able to sign his name.

How come everybody turns out to be a crook?

You can't give up.

Did you hear that click?

They dragged me downstairs.  I thought they were going to kill me.

Thank you.  God bless you for helping us.

She's awake but she hasn't spoken. I don't know what they did to her. I don't want to think about it.

She's a child.  She might panic. She doesn't know me.  She might not come to me.  She might just run.

Because a lot of people would've gotten killed.  Probably all the wrong ones.

We've almost got your husband and your daughter out.  So don't get any ideas.

Whose money is this?

And all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop --

Sit completely still with both hands on the wheel -- until they get here.

Who's in back?

Not all.  They already have a third.  The question is how much of that are they willing to give to get you back?

I'm not trying to lose them.  Nor am I exceeding any speed limits.

You, I would've noticed.

Only in the leg or the thigh. You'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts.

What's Nels' number?

Any idea where you're going?

They did some great job of reforming you.

What's your point?

Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.

Know what else is in here?

It's going to be some fucking snowstorm.

Five ... six.

Thank God -- thank God I've got you.

You're making it too easy.

Where do we meet?

Sure.

I'm here.  Where are you?

I'm three quarters of the way up the lot behind the concession stand.

Stop the crying.

Count it.

Yeah.  Why don't we?

Okay Nels, you can always keep what you've got and haul ass leaving the lovely lady for me to worry about.  I'll bet she can be friendly when it's in her best interests.

If he pulls me over he gets all the proceeds plus Lenore here.

You're going to have to see to it that both lanes of this road get blocked.

Yeah?

Yeah?

Somebody better tear this down before it falls down.

Brilliant -- unless they were close enough to see the cab pull away.  In which case you just warned them.

Don't be afraid to say hello. Your friend with the recent transplant is in no condition to deliver that briefcase.  So I've taken on the task.

I thought so.

Scottish?

So can we consider you a regular, sir?

She wants me to tell you go fuck yourself.

You could always make it up to her.

He gave me a look.

He agreed that he was.

Ask him.

See, they get the wrong idea.

Don't chuck my clothes out!

Look, I'm sorry.

No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm sorry, didn't I?

Is that his tart? Does Pat have a tart?

If I was her I'd consider that an insult.

What's that supposed to mean?

Doesn't the water get to your nails?

How'd you guess?

You old-fashioned?

What was that all about?

He's getting up.

You want me to ask you in, right?

Why?

Someone out there.

Sorry. How'd he drive with his neck in a brace?

As different as it's possible to be.

You want to know how I kissed him?

Are you jealous of him?

Drink.

What you thinking of, hon?

Did he ever tell you you were beautiful?

Even now.

Got your note. So let's kiss and make up, hon.

Made me feel all funny inside.

Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.

How?

Details, baby, details.

Kind of wish I didn't.

Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.

She's the thing you had to tell me.

Shouldn't be, Dil

And you're not going to tell me more?

What you doing, Jimmy?

Do you like me even a little bit?

You want another haircut, baby?

You'd like me better that way, Jimmy?

You want to make me look like him...

Don't call me that --

Why?

Why are we going here, Jimmy?

Are you supposed to take that many?

Dil Can I tell you something? I knew your man.

Your soldier.

You killed my Jody

You didn't.

Wondered why you came on to me like that when you gave me the look.

Dil!!!

Promise?

Where am I to go, Jimmy?

Sorry, love. Now, the white ones are magnesium supplement --

Yeah. Just checking. He being nice to you, Dil?

Fergus!

Tough work, that.

Leave us, Judie.

Leave her out of this.

You were made for this.

Jude?

Dil!

Give him a cup of tea.

You sure?

Back in a minute, Jody

Why do you want to do that for?

And who is she?

So what do you think that is, Hennessy?

Now, if you took the ropes off, I'd be able to feed myself.

You trying to hurt my feelings?

You're going to have to do it, aren't you?

Shut the fuck up, would you?

No, what's the funny thing?

Didn't look like that to me...

Take it easy, now. Just go slow. Down by that tree.

Now, that was worth waiting for.

Don't know her.

See if she's all right.

When I was a child...

Nothing.

The teddy bear?

What if I did?

And you know what?

Not here.

Have you no feelings, woman?

You're heading for trouble, Fergus --

Leave him alone, Peter. He's in love.

I could eat a horse.

All that marvelous rejection -- you knew I couldn't resist it. Now it turns out you were only interested in the money.

I know why you're not taken -- no one can catch up with you.

That wraps it up -- Tex has the money. Go back to bed -- I'll let you know when I've found him.

If the police find him first they're not very likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us, are they?

I just heard from him -- he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him -- so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got it.

Where's that airlines bag?

Electric razor -- comb -- steamship ticket -- fountain pen -- four passports -- toothbrush -- wallet --  key -- what about that?

Heroin -- peppermint-flavored heroin.

I think it only said where -- but I can't --

Now what?

Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.

Tex? You mean he's here, too?

Reggie -- why won't you listen?

Reggie -- please believe me!

Reggie -- listen to me!

Reggie -- trust me once more -- please.

Never mind -- I'll go by myself.

I'm sorry -- my secretary must have gone to lunch. You are -- ?

Have some, please. I've got...  ...liverwurst -- liverwurst -- chicken and -- liverwurst.

Do you know what C.I.A. is, Mrs. Lampert?

Yes -- That all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he's in business.

To be more specific, he was wanted by this agency.

Mrs. Lampert, I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger.

Ours.

We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.

Why not?

Dyle, or whatever his name is.

He's hardly my Mr. Dyle.

I suppose you're old enough to have heard of World War Two?

Café.

Have you any idea what these things cost over here?

No, Mrs. Lampert.

I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out, don't you?

Calm down, Mrs. Lampert -- please. Does he have the money?

No.

That's a face you don't forget -- he was there too --

You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?

Around one.

Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve me right if I got stuck with that one.

Only if you can prove to me that you're really Brian Cruikshank.

Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?

We'd better exchange keys. Here's mine.

It's the only name I've got. How about you?

Your --

Didn't anyone ever tell you it's impolite to --  What happened?

Are you really Carson Dyle's brother?

Sure.

Is there a Mrs. Dyle?

I hope it turns out you're a Whitefoot, Alex -- I could be very happy hanging around the tepee.

Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.

Lord, I forgot all about it -- Sylvie works late Tuesday nights -- she always leaves him with me. They wouldn't do anything to a little boy, would they?

Hello, Herman, it was a happy landing, I see.

Or Tex?

What's so illogical about that?

Women. You know, I can't help feeling rather sorry for Scobie.  Wouldn't it be nice if we were like that?

I'd love some, thanks.

Don't worry, I'm not going to hit you.

Maybe somebody felt that four shares were too many --

What? Assassinate somebody?

Hurry up and change -- I'm starved.

Reggie -- open the door.

Then I suggest you call one of them.

I usually sing a medley of old favorites when I bathe -- any requests?

It is called 'The Hawaiian Blue' and there are only seven left. In 1894 the owner of one was murdered by a rival collector who was obsessed to own it.

I'm -- I'm sorry.

I suggest you get about your business -- nothing soothes Herman like success.

You sure nuthin's missin'?

Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead.

Your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this morning at seven.

Oh. Swiss. His profession?

Is it all right?

If you will sign this list you may take the things with you.

I don't understand.

I was, too.

Up there! It is up there!

But he is gone.

I don't know -- how would I know?

Yes, of course. But you will let me know if anyone goes on the critical list 

How's that?

Doing what?

Hallo, Peter.

What was all that?

You mean you and me?

You haven't said a word since we left the club -- what happened back there?

Him: 'Do you mind if I come in for a nightcap, Reggie?' Her: 'Well -- it is awfully late.' Him: 'Just one, all right?' Her: 'Promise you'll behave yourself.' Him: 'Sorry, baby, I never make promises I can't keep.'

So they think he left it with you.

I wouldn't take that too seriously.

Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the morning.

Stop that!

Can you give me one good reason why I should?

What is it about?

Sylvie -- ? What are you doing here?

This ain't no game, Miz Lampert.

He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.

ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN?

I get all your CDs.

IT'S LISA SHERMAN. But she still looks like we're eighteen.

It's almost ten o'clock.

Your curfew is 9:30 and you know it, little miss.

You said that two weeks ago.

Hi honey.

A little.

You know her?

Who is she Daddy?

You were eavesdropping.

What kind of a person wakes up in the morning and says to themselves, 'Think I'll nail a sixteen year old girl to a tree today'?

Is Jody still awake?

Well?

I knew Lisa Sherman long ago. It's extremely important that I get inside and try to verify that it's the same woman who lived here.

No.

I know where you're going.

Your brother told us.

Shh. I'm not going to tell you not to go.

But I shouldn't shut it down?

Pay no attention to me.

Please get out of my way or I'll have to hurt you.

You aren't going to the party?

Me? Why me?

_ Your father raped someone?

Yes.

Go sit next to him.

Mark Shale.

No! That's his table.

I promised I'd go right home after school.

Sandy, you have to chill out, at least two-thirds of the kids in our class are still virgins. He can't butcher all of us.

Someone tried to kill me.

Mark invited me to the party.

Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.

Don't you think it's sick?

I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash?

Everyone's grounded. There's a killer on the loose.

Are you coming to the party?

You flaunt some slut in my face.

And when I finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat.

Thanks for coming back for me.

Hi mom.

I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind.

Where are you going?

Yes.

You ok?

What are you doing?

What?

Hey! That was a 3k machine.

I said no.

Let me just ask you a serious question first.

Rod!

Unfair?!

Stacy?









...if we don't get out of this tunnel!

...and fair...

Wait, wait.  You don't believe the dead guy, do...

...is as dangerous as you seem to think it is, I'm gettin' my ass as far away from you and it as possible. 

All right.

You want cash?

All right, then how about this?

You gave him ice cream, didn't you?  Come on, let's go.

Come on, get in the truck.

...up.

It happens to this piece of shit...

...-ed.

Billings?  No, no, no, no, no.  We need to go to McGruder.

...-er.

We can't push old Pete in this heat.  He can't take it.

 

Take your gun!

What?

...I'm not the psycho.

Every time I look at you, I wanna hit...

...waiting!

...up!

You think we can make what?!  You see that truck?!

Your weedkiller on steroids goes down with us!  Everybody  dies!

Go, go, go, go, go.  Oh, shit.

Come on...

What the fuck was that?!

Yeah...

 Aw, shit  

You're--?  What?!



Uh-oh.

...there'd be a sales rep desk with my name on it.  But every time something opened up, there'd be some idiot cousin...

 Yeah.

Not completely, anyway.

A-And you  owe me...

 

Ow!  

Arlo, shut up.

Okay. 

You got Elvis?!

Aw, shit.  Would you be more care-...

Oh, fuck!

Here...

...tunnel!

Whoo!

Forty-seven.  You'd better floor it.

Unbe-fucking-lievable.

Mason.

What?



You know, we saved half a million people from a full-body peel.

Stop limpin' around like that.

 Yeah.

Oh!

I was undercover as a tennis player.





 Just give me Elvis and I'll make sure you have enough money for a dozen ice cream trucks.

Your move.  Okay, Vaughn, you drive.

I urge you to be persuasive.



Yeah, that's my truck.

 ...to Fort McGruder in his truck. 

...here.   Mason... 

Listen, deputy.

Yes, sir.

Sweeney tells me you don't have computer confirmation?

...-lar.

...-bility.

Damn you, Long!  My people are out there! Your people are out there!

...about--

You look fit...healthy...

...-ple.

...always done, Richard?

And let me guess.  You failed.

Brynner.

Carl!  Set up the camera.

Hit him again.

Vaughn.

Sir, all potential customers have been informed of the delay.  Fur-...

I'm on it.

Carl, Dennis, get out of sight.

...gear?

Not tonight...

I don't see my container.





Yeah?

 Two pots of coffee...

Oh, no?

...somehow. 

Video lock.

It's after five...

Geneva just pulled the plug.

Major, we've gotta seal that tunnel!  Major!

...tight!

Gomez, you fight the battles you can win.  Now, we've been outmaneuvered here.  Brynner's next move is gonna be to get Elvis out of the country and sell him to the highest bidder.  To do that, he has to have planned an exit point.  That's where we intercept him.  That's where we make our play.  Now you and your men back off.

Is Elvis out?

Missoula's reporting the refrigerator truck as a stolen vehicle.  I told you Mason was walking shit.

Deputy Art Lewis, Jerome County Sheriff's Department.

My secret?

...is a perfect hunter.

And what if it does?

...-m-means, Mason.  

What we gave Brynner on the dam was a phony!

...public drunkenness....

...to talk, son.

 Listen, Pappas...

Don't move!

What the hell was that?

Look at that.

If you were a bank president that would be one thing, but in your business it's admirable. And it's good advertising.

But I'm surprised you're still working for her, unless she's suddenly come up with another husband.

Far as it goes. Of course he has to swim in the same water we all do.

...Exactly what do you know about me, Mr. Gittes?

What about her?

Is she all right?

Where is she?

Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can't already afford?

Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well?

What's that, Curly?

Forget it. How would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to Ensenada... you'd have to leave tonight.

I might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it for you. Maybe an even hundred.

So there's this fella who's tired of screwing his wife.

The apple core?

I have a cold I can't seem to shake but other than that, I'm fine.

You've done well by yourself.

Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?

You wouldn't happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman.

I want the rest of the pictures.

Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake down Mulwray, she hired you, and that's how you happen to know Mulwray was murdered.

Yeah, I once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. That's where she drew the line.

I know what he says.

Where?

No, Gittes, you'll show us.

Give you three minutes.

Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. It's a felony.

Get him away from her. He's responsible for everything. Get him away from her!

No.

But I thought you'd hired a private investigator.

Iced tea.

Yes, Mr. Gittes?

No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.

Sorry. Look, you sue me, your husband dies, you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato, and all of it quicker than wind from a duck's ass. Excuse me. Then you ask me to lie to the police.

If your husband was killed it was.  This can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence.

Is there anything else you want to know?

I can't tell you.

Oh, no. I've got my own car. The creamcolored Packard.

Whoever's behind my husband's death, why have they gone to all this trouble?

Oh, yeah?

You sure shout that?

What are you thinking?

There was a memorial service at the Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar Crabb. He died three weeks ago.

What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's here, that's all.

As little as possible.

What's wrong?

What did he say?  What did he say?

C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray. You've got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there!

Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.

You're going to miss your train!  Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah, soon as you can.

I found these in your backyard... in your fish pond. They belonged to your husband, didn't they?... didn't they?

I said I want the truth.

That's worse... Just get out of here. Walk out, leave everything.

I'll take care of it.

On his day off. Get the exact address.

Walsh here?

Sophie.

Sophie.

Where'd he go yesterday?

Listen, we can't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something.

Yeah, Sophie.

Oh my goodness.

I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?

Mind if I take one of your cards? In case I want to get in touch with you again.

Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you.  Do you know Claude Mulvihill here?

I don't understand.

Hard working, have a wife and kids...

That's a long fall.

Come again?

It's bone dry, Morty.

Gittes?... Gittes?

Can't we talk about this alone, Mr. Gittes?

All right, what's your husband's first name?

Never heard of 'em... new owners?

Look, Jake. She gave us Mulwray's real phone number and address.

Think you can nail Mulvihill? They'll claim you were trespassing.

Lots of fellas do. Tell the little woman they're going on a fishing trip, then shack up with some little twist on the island... she pretty?

That right?... She used to be some looker.

'Cause sometimes you can't find the right place any more and so...well, actually...they stay here.  Besides, there are more kisses than you can count.

Any room for me in this Cinema Paradiso? 

Eh! Love...what a mystery!  I understand you, Toto...The ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful. Whatever you do, you can't make friends with them.  Eh, there's nothing to be done about it! The heavier a man is, the deeper his footprints. And if he's in love, he suffers, because he knows he's up a one-way street. Because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants... 

What is it, Alfredo? Right now, of all times!

You're still beautiful...

I saw your daughter. She's beautiful! Who knows how many Salvatores must be running after her...

Daddy's not coming back...He's dead. 

But why do you call me 'Mr. Di Vita'? It didn't used to be that way...

That's all right.  We have no secrets from our readers.  Mr. Thatcher is one of our most devoted readers, Mr. Bernstein.  He knows what's wrong with every issue since I've taken charge. What's the cable?

Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that it represents a new low...  Have you got that, Mr. Bernstein? In the opinion of this reviewer -

It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm dictating it.

All right, but I'll keep these figures, too, just in case.

It's a saying, Mr. Bernstein.  A new broom sweeps clean.

Say, with them fellows -  - it's no trick to get circulation.

Gentlemen of the "Enquirer"!  This has, I think, been a fitting welcome to those distinguished journalists -  Mr. Reilly in particular - who are the latest additions to our ranks. It will make them happy to learn that the "Enquirer's" circulation this morning passed the two hundred thousand mark.

Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein.

It's wonderful, Mr. Kane.  Wonderful. Wonderful.

I might make him nervous.

You're pretty young, Mr. -  Mr. Thompson.  A fellow will remember things you wouldn't think he'd remember. You take me.  One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on a ferry and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in -  - and on it, there was a girl waiting to get off.  A white dress she had on - and she was carrying a white pastrol - and I only saw her for one second and she didn't see me at all - but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl.  See what I mean?  Well, so what are you doing about this "Rosebud," Mr. Thompson.

Who else you been to see?

Thatcher!  That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -

He finished it.  He wrote the worst notice I ever read about the girl he loved.  We ran it in every paper.

The way things turned out, I don't need to tell you - Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud!

We'll be on the street soon, Charlie - another ten minutes.

Wasted?

Sixty-two thousand -

Do you, Mr. Leland?

Do you, Mr. Leland?

Mr. Leland, why didn't you go to Europe with him?  He wanted you to.  He said to me just yesterday -

Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am I a New England school-marm?

Hello, Mr. Leland.

Where is it - where's my notice? I've got to finish it!

I thought it would be a nice gesture - the new publisher -

You may resume your work, gentlemen.  I didn't know your plans and so I was unable to make any preparations.

But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane. After all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices -

I'm not criticizing, Mr. Carter, but here's what I mean.  There's a front page story in the "Chronicle,"  and a picture - of a woman in Brooklyn who is missing.  Probably murdered.  A Mrs. Harry Silverstone.  Why didn't the "Enquirer" have that this morning?

But, Mr. Kane -

Yes, Mr. Kane.

The nurse has complete instructions, but if you care to talk to me at any time, I should be only too glad -  I shall be here in the morning.

Almost two to one -

I know that, Emily -

I'm sending Junior home in the car, Charles - with Oliver -

Oh!!

You don't think I'm going to let this blackmailer intimidate me, do you?

There's only one person in the world to decide what I'm going to do - and that's me.  And if you think - if any of you think -

I can't tell you the things he said, Charlie.  You haven't got any idea -

You can't blackmail me, Rogers, you can't -

Toothache.

A rooster?

No.  That is, I bet it turns out I've heard your name a million times, only you know how it is -

You've been wonderful!  I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and - 

What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?

Yes -

Would you sing for me?

Hurray for the bulldog!  Half past eleven!  The shows have just let out.  People are going to night clubs and restaurants.  Of course, we're different.  We live in a palace - at the end of the world.

Oh, I'm sick and tired of you telling me what I must and what I musn't do!

What you want me to want, you mean. What you've decided I ought to have - what you'd want if you were me. But you've never given me anything that -

Oh, I don't mean the things you've given me - that don't mean anything to you.  What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at?  It's only money.  It doesn't mean anything. You're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care about.

You're talking an incredible amount of nonsense, Susan.  Whatever I do -  I do - because I love you.

She doesn't know, Mrs. Kane.  She just sent it - because I made her see it wouldn't be smart for her not to send it.

I know the facts, Mr. Kane.  And I happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean.  You're a man of great talents, Mr. Kane.

I understand that you have political ambitions.  Unfortunately, you seem incapable of allowing any other opinion but your own -

Impossible!  Impossible!

Mrs. Kane would like to see you, Mr. Kane.

Raymond - 

Do you like poetry, Raymond?

How did you get him to part with it, Mr. Kane?

Oil belonging to the people of the United States was leased out for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks -  Nobody can blame me because -

There are the people of the United States, and they are blaming you - Oh, I know it doesn't make any sense, but at least you can learn a lesson from it.

First of all - 

I'll tell you what I'll do, Brad - I'll get drunk, too - maybe that'll help.

She hasn't any friends left sine you started this oil business, and she never sees you.

Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York.  It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth. 

What check?

Sorry, Mr. Leland.

Oh, yes.  I know about Mr. Rawlston.

On your way out, stop at a cigar store, will you, and send me up a couple of cigars?

I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.

The banks are out of luck, eh?

How do you want to handle the whole thing - ask questions?

I did a lot of singing after that. I sang for Charlie -  I sang for teachers at a hundred bucks an hour - the teachers got that, I didn't -

He was in love with me.  But he never told me so until after it all came out in the papers about us - and he lost the election and that Norton woman divorced him.

I'll come down in a week or so and see her again.  Say, you might be able to help me.  When she used to talk about Kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about Rosebud?

Are you sure?

Are you sure?

What's this?

It's not the same.

Fifty-five.

If you're going to drink it in here, I'd appreciate it if you'd not bother the customers.

Hey, now wait a sec...

You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching?

She said not to come home until graduation.

You can hold me down.

You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite.

You're kidding.

Why?

I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well, I didn't want to mess it up.

Well... kind of, sort of?

No.

Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck.

No, I wasn't. Not really. I told you'd I'd been seeing other people.

I don't want to marry him. I don't want to get married now. I'm on the verge of graduation. I want to go to grad school after this. And then I want to start a career. I don't want to be a wife first, and then have to worry about when I'm going to fit in all of the other stuff.  I've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife. And I know that's what I'd become. Sang's already signed with a major firm, and he's going to be pulling a huge salary, which would give me no reason to work, and he's so traditional anyway...

I just told you.

Look how full of yourself you are.

I had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on. When I say I don't want to get married, I mean just that. I don't want to marry anybody. Not for years.

It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it.

You mean, on a date?

Sang.

He's not invited.

I can already tell this isn't going to work.

This isn't fucking funny, Dante!

With this guy locked in?

That's easy to say from over here.

I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR FUCKING HEAD! YOU FUCKING JERKOFF!

Awww, he's so cute. What's his name?

I work in a shitty video store. I want to go to a good video store so I can rent a good movie.

I saw one, one time, that said the world was ending the next week. Then in the next week's paper, they said we were miraculously saved at the zero hour by a Koala-fish mutant bird. Crazy shit.

You open?

That's what I said.

What smells like shoe polish?

You win.

She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party.

It takes different strokes to move the world.

Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett.  It ends on such a down note. And that's life-a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.

It would stand to reason, yes.

More or less.

You'll never believe what this unruly customer just said...

Why doesn't he just mix and match?

What did he say?

It's not like you laid the eggs yourself.

Oh, it's great. You step into this little booth and there's this window between you and this naked woman, and she puts on this little show for like ten bucks.

Why do you do things like that? You know she's going to come back and tell the boss.

I'm gonna hear it tomorrow.

Because my ex-girlfriend is getting married.

Don't yell at me, pal.

At least we're stuck here together.

Julie Dwyer died.

Oh, my god.

Shit. What about tomorrow?

You hardly knew her!

She was pretty young, hunhh?

Shut the hell up.

He made it, hunhh?

You know.

Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?

May I be blunt with you?

Get to work.

Really?

I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?

You're a snake.

I love your sexy talk. It's so... kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee.

Around three or something.

It's true. You'll sit there and blame life for dealing a cruddy hand, never once accepting the responsibility for the way your situation is.

You date Veronica because she's low maintenance and because it's convenient. Meanwhile, all you ever do is talk about Caitlin. You carry a torch for a girl you dated in high school-in high school for God's sake! You're twenty-two!

Lovely story.

I'm calling out. Going to hit the hospital-see how Caitlin is. Then try to see Veronica.

Are you open?

Caitlin Bree. Yeah?

Yes, they are. You're out of shape.

Pretty girl, about this girl's height- dark hair-gorgeous body?

What? When? When did all this shit happen?

Noinch, noinch, noinch-smoking weed, smoking weed! Doing coke!  Drinking beers!  A pack of wraps, my good man. It's time to kick back, drink some beers, and smoke some weed!

Hell yes, whatever that means. Now I'm gonna head over to Atlantic, drink some beers, get ripped, and- please God-get laid.  E-Z Wider, one-and-a-halfs.

So why do you sell it for so much more? I'll tell you why-because people come here and they're like "A dollar eighty for soda? I should get it at Food City. But I don't feel like driving there. I'll just buy it here so I don't have to drive up there." That's exploiting a weakness, too, isn't it?

Hey, man, what happened with that old guy?

Is she that girl who's down here all the time? She came here today carrying a plate of food.

What the hell is that? Resting his eyes! It's not like he's some goddamned air traffic controller!

You know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer.

Oh... Can I help you?

Yeah, okay. Go ahead.

We might have; I don't remember. How many?

What the hell was that for?

Three?

No; who were the three, besides me?

What do you mean?

Yeah, right.

You sucked that guy's dick?

But... but you said you only had sex with three guys! You never mentioned him!

You sucked his dick!

How many?

A few?

The ostrich syndrome: if you don't see it...

Bummer, Well, I've gotta head back for the one-thirty class.

A couple...?

Were you working here at about four o'clock?

I'm not out of shape!

A fine, for five hundred dollars.

Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!

Check this out, he's from Russia.

Did he say "making fuck?"

You're Dante Hicks? Oh my God! I didn't even recognize you!

Really?

You've never heard anybody say anything about either movie?

I only pointed out that you weren't paying any attention to what I was saying.

You hope what feels good?

That's the price, my brother.

Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party.

I... I don't know what to say.

No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed off. I feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it!  He has his friend do it for him!

I have first dibs.

Gabe!  Hey, man!  Gabe!  It's Gabe!

Did I hear somethin' break? Outside left!

Jessie, Jessie, copy?

Surprise me.

A monkey?

That was the first and last question-- now only answers. Where's the chopper?

Go on, fetch.

I think it's out.  No big deal. It's that old football injury.

I love you, too.

You don't know anything. You did it your way and she died.

Forget me.  If you can, get away.

Sarah, tonight why don't you and Hal come over for dinner?

There you go.

He knows it well.

Enough.

Hello, Gabriel.

I don't understand?

You're saying, I don't understand?  I'm the <u>only</u> one who does understand.  I'm the one you lived with for two years, I'm the one you made promises to, I'm the one who spent too many nights looking up at these rocks and wondering if you were ever going to make it down in once piece or ever at all.  Believe me, there's been times I didn't know what I wanted to do more, love you or hate you.  But the one thing in our relationship that I did know and still do know is that I <u>understand you</u>.

Excuse me?

Gabe, did you come back to stay?  You didn't.

Where?

Thank God you didn't leave.  We just got a Mayday.  Seven climbers stranded off Comb Bluff. The weather's pouring in fast and Hal's gone up alone.

That's not the issue here, those people are.  He can't do it alone.

Frank dropped me in the west valley and I hiked.  You look frozen.  What's happening?!

You still wear the cable necklace I gave you.

Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?

Gabe...your arm?

Can you see light?

Gabe are you alright?

Thanks for holding on.

But maybe with a good start I can hit those hand-holds.

We don't have time to argue about it!

Take the rope.

Wrap it around that rock twice.

Fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience.

The "old mouth to mouth" resuscitation routine.

Your mouth's writing a check your ass can't cash, but if ya wanna buy some life, bring me the money.

Where's the helicopter?

For Christ's sake, they're kids.

Murdering, motherfucker...

Go after her.

Calm down...give the gun to me. You're out of control, son.

What's the delay?

Why?  What are you going to do?!

This way.

Why the hell are we wasting time here?!

You got what we need?

I don't like you should do what you done. And I'm not your brother no more and wouldn't want to be.

He are here! He have arrived! Hooray!

Dear, dear, dear. Whatever happened to you, my boy? Mr. Alexander, now confined to a wheelchair, pushes himself away from his desk, and rolls up to Julian. The water drips off Alex's clothes. They look at each other.

I know who you are! Isn't it your picture in the newspapers? Didn't I see you this morning on the video? Are you not the poor victim of this horrible new technique?

Your wife, sir? Has she gone away?

Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir.

Fine, sir, fine.

Thank you very much, sir.

What would you like to know, sir?

Hi. Hi. Hi, there my Pee and Em. All three look up startled.

Wrong? Why should you think of anything being wrong, have you been doing something you shouldn't. Yes? He shakes Alex's hair.

Well, yes, it's just a manner of speech from your Post Corrective Advisor to you that you watch out, little Alex. He puts his arm round Alex's shoulder.

Cut out all this clever talk about milicents. Just because the Police haven't picked you up lately doesn't, as you very well know, mean that you've not been up to some nastiness. There was a bit of a nastiness last night, yes. Some very extreme nastiness, yes. A few of a certain Billyboy's friends were ambluenced off late last night, yes. Your name was mentioned, the word's got thru to me by the usual channels. Certain friends of yours were named also. Oh, nobody can prove anything about anybody as usual, but I'm warning you, little Alex, being a good friend to you as always, the one man in this sore and sick community who wants to save you from yourself. Deltoid makes a grab for Alex's joint but finds his hand instead. Alex laughs. Derisively and rises. Deltoid distractedly reaches for a glass of water on the night table, and fails to notice a set of false teeth soaking in them. He drinks from the glass. The clink of the teeth sounding like ice-cubes.

You are now a murderer, little Alex. A murderer, yes.

I've just come back from the hospital. Your victim has died.

So now you have the same reaction to music as you do to sex and violence?

Thank you very much for this chance, sir.

Good evening, my boy.

Yes, sir, and a very lovely place it is too, sir, when I wake up in the middle of the night with my pain.

Where is he now, sir?

As an unmuddied lake, Fred. As clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. You can rely on me, Fred.

Surprise?

Hullo lad. What a surprise, good to see you.

Fine, fine.

Oh fine, fi. Keeping out of trouble, you know.

No thanks, Mum. It'll pass in a minute...  ... What have you done with all my own personal things?

What about Basil? Where's my snake?

I wanna be sick.

... And again... Go on!!! Again! There's a good boy.

Yes sir.

Have you ever had any mental illness?

Do you wear any false teeth or false limbs?

No, sir.

No, sir.

No, sir.

Something like that. You are a little undernourished, so after each meal were going to give you a shot. Roll over on your right side please, loosen your pyjama pants and pull them half-way down. He does, somewhat reluctantly. She gives him a shot in the bum.

Well, that was a very promising start. By my calculations, you should be starting to feel alright again. Yes? Dr. Brodsky's pleased with you. Now tomorrow there'll be two sessions, of course, morning and afternoon.

Well, of course, it was horrible. Violence is a very horrible thing. That's what you're learning now. Your body is learning it.

Are you referring to the background score?

Just part of hospital routine.

Yes. Yes, well don't think about it too long, just say the first thing that pops into your mind.

Good. The boy you always quarrelled with is seriously ill.

Fucking hell...

And when do I get out of here then?

Father - may I ask you a question in private?

But it is being used, isn't it, Father?

Instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee and shall give delight to thy soul.

One pair of trousers - blue pinstriped.

One pair of underpants - white with blue waistband.

Mothballs, sir.

Yeah... Pete the English.

Well, it's a surprise all right, a bit bewildering too.

Well, what's the matter lad, are you feeling alright?

Well, fine... we could still look at C-Block.

Like what?

No, no way, I couldn't take that...

Annie...it's Max.

...okay, Max, I believe you...I'll get out of the building...

...he's two floors below you.

Where are you, what floor?

This your current address?

A deer?

You dizzy?  You want to sit down?

Get outta here!  You and Louis?

What?

I picked up a tail.

You think I wanted to come here tonight?  You think I'm that stupid? Sometimes shit happens, you gotta roll with it.

You guys been holding hands?

Remember that thing a few years back? That thing with the cab?

Cabbie drove around all night.  Three people got killed.

I never bought that.

I was with Max when he got the call.

I'm sure you're very proud of Max.

You're gonna cheer up.

I'm...in...the...room, here.  Don't talk about me like I'm not in the room.

I know you're out there!  Answer the goddamn call!

Vincent <u>Farrell</u>, Assistant U.S. Attorney.  A passenger in this taxicab, and I'm reporting you to the DMV...

Same fare you talked to last time. The U.S. Attorney...

Yeah?  So?

Hello?

Uh, let's go to...  Hello...?

First time in New York?

He fell on my cab!  From up th-th-there.

Uh, look...why don't you just take the car...

Max.  May we leave the scene of the crime now, please.

Try some deep breathing.

You better?

What are you doing?

Oh.  Oh, no.  You're kidding.  We...

Music.

That one's probably married.  Think of his kids.  His wife's pregnant...

Who's that?

I had no idea these cabs came equipped with emergency strobes.  Where's the button?  Under the dash?

But, hey, some good news.  This last one put me way ahead of schedule. We've actually got some time to kill.  Jazz?  You like jazz?

...see now, this has got a little post- war flavor, a little Miles thing happening.  Awesome.  What do you think?

Let's go.

Show up for what?

Mom, Vincent's not interested.

You take one more step, I'll kill her.

It's cause they don't like their lives, so they project their patterns of negative behavior onto you...  I had a father like that.

What, no insurance?

Damn, Max.  I'm impressed.  Really.  I would have bet good money you wouldn't walk out of there.

What holds you back, Max?  Tell me. Why does life scare you so much?

Good.  Blood, urine and death get to you? Try deep breathing.  Or remember we all die anyway...

How are you at math?  I was hired for five hits.  I did four.

How do I know?  But, they all got that "witnesses for the prosecution" look to me.  Probably some major federal indictment against somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted...  I dunno.

Slow the hell down!

They said send you downstairs.

Love gives you wings.  It makes you fly.  I don't even call it love.  I call it Geronimo.

Are you crazy?!

I was only going one way.

Tell you what.  Reminds me of life in the Delta.

Mekong, my friend, Mekong.

Flip.  You're the closest thing I got to a friend around here.  Tell me something.  You think I'm crazy?

I don't see the connection.

You going to warn him?

Just relax.

You saved my life.

What took so long?  You were in there all day.

Crown Victoria.  F.B.I. car.  A legitimate tail.

Yes.

Nothing scary there.  Sorry.

More about life on Mars.  From a rock they <u>found</u> on the South Pole. Explain that one to me.  But maybe we should go to Mars and find out? How much do you think that's going to cost?

Well that's the eye right there. <u>Money</u>.  And all the power and misery it brings with it. It's a plot to take over the world.  The Master Conspiracy. Can take a lifetime to pull off.

Here it is.  <u>Conspiracy Theory</u>  It just went out Tuesday.  Third issue this year.  I bet I struck a nerve.  Pissed someone off.

Johnny Dancer, right?  You don't ride him anymore, do you?  Not since your dad died.

Did you see the van back there?

Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse.  I should have realized.

Murdered?

Oh, Christ, here it comes.  Look, I know you think I'm crazy.  I don't think I am, but...

Yesterday you were wondering about the wall.  How it was possible.

I don't.  I know you wouldn't.

You look great.

After you.  It's okay.  I'm the one who left it here.

What about them?

Back where?

You got to get out of here.  My cell phone's on.  Back in the truck.

Blue moon... Blue moon...

Liza?

They changed Franklin's portrait.

I'm a very patient man.

You shouldn't watch, Jerry.  It's a moment without hope.

Thank you.

You should think of me as Liza Sutton's guardian angel.

Veritas.  Truth.  What is it they say about truth?

That's it.  I went to Yale.  I hope you won't hold that against me.

I didn't know the C.I.A. had psychiatrists.

Brain washing, mind control, that sort of thing?

A vulgar pop term, but yes.  Take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin.  That was our goal.

As in 'resulting in death.'  We pushed the envelope until it wasn't even an envelope anymore.

Jerry told me he bit your nose.

A dog.

Where'd you get it?

In Jerry's safety deposit box.

Yes.

Go ahead, Miss Sutton.

I've been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to Jerry Fletcher.  We're not to discuss him with the press, the N.Y.P.D., anyone.  Building police are to arrest him on sight and we're to report any attempt he makes to contact you.

It makes perfect sense.  Field work is not our oeuvre.

That's the book Hinkley had on him when he shot Reagan.

Agent Lowry.

Don't go home.  And don't go to work.  Either one could be bad.

... And this is how the extraterrestrial presented himself to you?  As your father?

He died...  ... in 1972.

You don't believe it to be... tell me something, Doctor.  Why do you think they would go to all this trouble... bring you tens of thousands of light years, and then send you home without a shred of proof?  Sort of bad form, wouldn't you say?  What was their intent?

Very well; since my appointment he's been made interim director.

Ellie...

Then why haven't you detected any signals?  If, as you claim, there have been thousands, millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasn't one signal gotten through?  It'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through; you're welcome to stay until then.

What?

You...

What does it say?

... And while its function remains, for the moment, a mystery, my best guess is that it represents a transport of some kind.

Dr. Lunacharsky...?

What...

There's no way of knowing.  Without a key -- a primer, to help us, maybe never.

And?

Here, right around Centaurus A.

Talk to him.

I used... I used to dream you were alive... and then I'd wake up and lose you all over again.

Eventually you'll get here on your own.  This was just the first step; in time you'll take another.

No more stalling, Captain.

I didn't realize I was out.

Not if you think like a Vegan.

A machine.  But a machine that does what?

What's that?

It looks like pixie dust...  Kent would've given anything to see this.  David, too.

I'd say this is slightly different.

Ellie.  Arroway.

Sounds like a Russian general.

The V.L.A.?

Greenbank?

Right now -- we'll drive down to Ramey and get the base chaplain to marry us.

I'm serious about this, Peter --

Thank God.  When we lost contact, I thought -- we thought... but you're okay.  We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction.  Did you notice anything at all that --

I agree with Mr. Rank that there are unavoidable religious implications here -- but I don't think it justifies taking an alarmist position.  Dr. Arroway is right -- their chosen means of communication was a scientific one, and a scientific approach is probably appropriate, at least until the theological dimensions of the problem become more apparent.

Spoken like a true believer.

'My father's house has many mansions.'

I flinched.

I had... an experience.  Of belonging.  Of unconditional love. And for the first time in my life I wasn't terrified, and I wasn't alone.

Look, I'm a reasonable person, and reasonably intelligent.  But this experience went beyond both.  For the first time I had to consider the possibility that intellect, as wonderful as it is, is not the only way of comprehending the universe. That it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with.

Did you love him?

If you came back... you'd only be four years older -- but over 50 years would have passed on Earth.

... Another question I would ask would be a very simple one.  How did you do it?  How did you evolve as far as you have and not destroy yourselves?

So.  The final countdown.

During the crusades -- pilgrims who made the journey to the holy land brought back a palm frond to show they'd actually been there.  I thought it sort of made sense that Earth is now your holy land, so...

What...?

Ellie, what is it?

Do you really think your life is meaningless, Eleanor?  Is that why you're so quick to risk it -- because if your life means nothing then you have nothing to lose?

You're sure you want to?  In the universe I saw we're not exactly the stars of the show.  What happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small.

It's not enough, don't you understand?  I know it happened -- but by every standard of science, by every standard I've lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point.  It may be true but it doesn't matter because I can't prove it's real.

But --

In other words, God works in mysterious ways...

You have a question, Dr. Arroway?

I guess I'd say I trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of, thanks for the advice, but no thanks.  But to dilute or censor the truth, for whatever reason --

Well.  That would seem to decide it. Like it or not, for the moment, anyway, it looks like we're all in this together.

I don't know.  Maybe we built the damn thing wrong.  Maybe it was all a hoax...  The safest thing would probably be to do a Chernobyl; encase it in concrete.

Boss, I made an arrangement with that man to take his broom.

Buck is a deal.

Yeah.

Well, why not? Idee of marryin' got you all choked up, trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin' the hell out of all of us.

Go hard!

Please! Please!

You got your mind right, Luke?

He ain't even got the sense to run from the road like everybody else.

Had it done in Singapore. Bunch of us drunk as coots --

That ain't nuthing compared to what we used to do in San Pedro. There was this ensign...

Newmeat looks like a poker player, Drag.

Oh, man, did you see her? Did you see her?

Lemme see it!

Hey, buddy. Take it easy. You're making me look bad.

Yeah, I know. But what we gotta do first is stretch that l'il ol' belly of yours -- git it all strained out, in fightin' shape, like a barrage balloon.

But, Luke...

Luke. Where you goin?

Is that your answer, Old Man? You're a hardcase too, ain't you?

You don't understand a thing, do you, Drag?

Ana paira ninas. Koko's the brains.

I'm in.

I gotta believe. Out!  Now they're rollin'.  King-five-four gets an eight.  Pair'a nines with a Jack gets a four. Ninas still up.

Back a buck.

Picture's a phoney... Cost me a week's pay.

He doesn't know when to give in. They'll kill him.

Excuse me, but would you mind explaining why you're watching the lady upstairs?

Now look what you did.

It's almost six.  And guess what? Hall likes me bathed and shaved.

Yes.  Without question.

The test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects.

No, that's still in my jacket I was wearing.  We were supposed to meet on the docks, that number 47 wharf, 10 o'clock Friday.  He's gonna hand me 500 bucks.

You break into her apartment to deliver a gift?  Where is it?

Daryll Lee Cullum, he wrote that book, he wanted the lady to have it.  They won't let him send it to her, so I'm getting out, he asks me to deliver it in person, he says, put it on her pillow.  It has all about how he tried to kill her.

She's supposed to have it.

Mm-hmm.  I can't get to you.  You have to come to me.

For God's sake Peter, leave her out of it.  You don't want her, you want me.

You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.

We'll keep talking.  Until they get here.  Then... 

Do you have any evidence to report, ma'am?  Do you know any of the victims...

Because of your phone calls.

It was a lover or a husband. Someone close.  Somebody who knew her and cared about her.

How do you know that?

Can you make a copy we can show on our computers?

I am not going to look at any more pictures.  They're like a disease. They get into my head.  I can't get them out.

It's <u>anybody</u> connected to author- ity.  They write, they even knock on your door.  They're <u>fans</u>.  It thrills them to flirt with getting caught.

We've got another one.

Who turned off the Internet computer...

He comes in the window, we maybe grab him.  Where's the on-switch?

Injected Windex!  Why would he switch to a new m.o.?

Helen, hang up, let Ruben get on with his work...

'...great dark hall of fame... all our greatest killers...'  His greatest <u>heroes</u>?  He wants to be famous.  When they're caught and people like me write about them, we give them a kind of immortality. They get thousands of letters. Ramirez kills eight women and gets a hundred marriage proposals a month.  They're like film stars.

What happened to you?!

A man?  I thought he was a boy.  This last Christmas was the happiest Christmas I had in the last ten years... you know why?  It was the first Christmas in six years I was not in love.  Son of a bitch <u>married men</u>!  Who cares about marriage, the bed just gets crowded and noisy?!

I am not going to talk about it. How do you <u>know</u> it was Andy if the head was gone?  Where is the head? Are you looking for it?  Oh, God, why him?  Because of me.  I can't talk about it.  I write about things like this, stuff it all in books and bury it in libraries. This is the first person close to me who's ever died.  And it's because of me.  This monster killed him because I loved him.

Helen -- let go.  You've got to let go.

It's a game they like to play. Berkowitz -- "Son of Sam" -- hung around the crime scene, talking to the cops.  This one's probably watching <u>you</u>, laughing at you.

The lock...

You take it, hang on to it, it'll make you feel safer.  Stay put.

Just get out of your vehicle...

We don't see too many lady homicide detectives.  You have <u>my</u> respect. Have you discussed the note with Dr. Hudson?

Who came in after you?

Snotty neurotic bitch...

What's wrong with him?

Absolutely.

This is the anniversary of the summer of love and your city fathers have declared a Festival of Love.  The Mayor and Chamber of Commerce don't want TV announcing killers on the loose.

Oh, maaaaan?!

Where you going?

The prowler in Hudson's apartment turns out to have a meeting with a suspect...

Saks.  If he knew you did that! They're all asking me, 'what is she doing,' as it is.

Put in the Kevin Costner.

Where were you?

What!? They brought the car here?

It's about time.

I'm amazed that she'll let you drive her.

He must have tucked a lot of women in that huge car of his. It's like a bed on wheels. It must smell of semen...

Have you seen his penis?

After this sort of thing, how do people manage to look at a car, let alone drive one?  I'm trying to find Charles's car.

I don't think we should have come here. I'm surprised the police don't make it more difficult.

Who is that? The announcer. Do I know him?

Is this part of the act or are they really hurt?

There's still a patch of blood there on the road. Did you see it?

What is it?

You're kidding.

What does he want from you?

I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?

Why are the police taking this all so seriously?

I've always wanted to drive a crashed car.

I'm afraid Lhe's not a doctor.

Patient.

First you tell me to do what I want to, then you tell me to stop.

What?

Hi, Mom.

Go on, Letty. I want to see it on you.

I can't believe you finally gave me the shirt.

You did the right thing.

Tell us every detail.

I gather he's late as usual.

I'm here, Sweetheart. I'm here. It's going to be OK.

Oh, Letty, what happened?

Yes.

Ruth's already taken him home.

Which flowers did you order?

Michael just got a job.    Couldn't you congratulate him?

I'm going to take that as an honest effort at being open minded.

Letty, you should be in bed.

It had this red spot on its back.

I don't mean to go on and on like this.

You've been so great. I just feel a lot clearer about things.

No, 79. Sorry, this makes me nervous.

Let me shift gears here a minute...  Do you ever hear voices that other people don't hear or see things they don't?

What if it's got a pattern?

Don't take it personally.

You missed out on some great broccoli florets at dinner.

Guess.

Really, this isn't funny.

No.

We'll get caught.

Thanks.    Where've you been all day?

Why in the world did you let me start talking in metaphors? That's no way for us to break up.

You must have thought about it. Everyone does.

It's OK. You don't have to say anything.

John and Nurse Gates are waiting for you.

Tell me all.

Furnished?

Aren't you supposed to throw a bouquet or something?

This is it -- 3B.     Check it out.

Wow.

I love your apartment.

Hey.

Sounds good. Oh, and Letty?

Would you mind if we just called it an early night?

I think I should go home.

You're going to miss the Top Ten.

Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?

I've been thinking I could try to visit you at night after work, and then there'd be more time on weekends to see...

Like I've told you before I don't want you taking care of me.

So, another one bites the dust.

Can I put these here for tonight?

Yeah?

What are you doing?    You're going to be late.

You don't have a fever.

You know what I think we need? Martinis. How about martinis to celebrate?

Sure. Why?

I talked to Ruth a little bit, and I think it's about time...

Exactly. It's time to make decisions.

No, you've done a perfect job.

Whoa. Whoa. Have really loved me? Letty, it's natural to be nervous. But we're going to work through our problems.

Believe me, I wish I'd understood what was going on. I've worked really hard to get better.

How's it look?

Agent Hadley.

Yeah.   I figured I'd be hearing from you.

What the fuck was all that about at the hotel last night? I thought we had a deal?

Jesus.   What kind of FBI agent are you?

Who?

Oui.

This is a considerable move up for you, Daniel. The temptation of having so much money might be too much for you.

Hello?

I don't have it. That's why Vincent went to Chicago. They arrested him before he could bring it back.

Can I offer you something.    A drink? Coffee?

Then why not just fuckin' say better than expected? Everybody knows what better than expected means.

They're gonna be what?

Uh, no --

They knew who you were when they broke in your house?

You rob an associate of mine... a friend and--

This plane will take you to Canada. From there you can fly back to Paris.

Yeah.   We just go home.

Raymond, grab the tapes.    We're leaving!

Hopefully no one.

Turn on the flashlight.

Sami, tomorrow you lift a wallet from someone who looks like one of us.

That's an excellent plan.     Very comforting.

Besides, we don't know the city and--

The deal is whatever Mr. Bastaldi says it is.

You're sure?

I'm not a guy who is known for his patience and right now you're testing mine.

After the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window.

We've got to be careful not to use our real names while we're in here.

Hadley --

It's not your fault, Daniel.

Okay. Airports, train stations, bus station are out. We know they're connected to the car rental agencies because that's where they picked up Raymond.

What's he joking around for?    He's been shot.

What?

No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead.

I've got a way with people.

We had a deal before you and your friends became the new poster boys for crime.

-- you stole my cousin Enrique's car.

He told Enrique he didn't know anything about his car.

What'd I tell you? Huh, Vinny? What'd I tell you when you came to me for money? Didn't I ask you not to do it? Did I not say that?  What'd I say to him?

Yeah, French guys from France.

Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?

The map said to go left.

There's an exterior alarm system. There's also another one in the hall that leads to the bedroom with a motion detector. The control panel is in the bedroom.

Yes.

This is bad. This is really fuckin' bad. Am I the only one who sees how bad this is?

Don't tell me to be cool! We were supposed to be in and out. In and out! In the last twenty four hours we've managed to get the Mafia... the FBI... the Chicago Police Department and a group of Latin gang members after us. I haven't left out anyone, have I?  I don't think so, because we've already pissed off everyone in the fuckin' city!

Oh, man... this is bullshit!    You can't trust anyone these days.

This is a car. I think this is the best American car I've ever driven.

There's no reason to be abusive. You're projecting your anger on me as a defense mechanism.

I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.

No.   How much?

Going somewhere?

You lived there. You know the city.

We have a problem. Problem isn't the right word. Dilemma. No that really doesn't describe --  Do you know who that is?

It's good.

This is great. After everything we've been through we've got eight hundred euros and an autographed baseball.

Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be angry... but I'm the one who took the ball and that makes it mine.

Mr. Zammito?

No shit?

I would like to thank you for your hospitality.  If you are ever in Paris here is my number.

I think we went the wrong way.

Holy shit.

The money isn't here.

Algeria.

You put a loaded gun in your bag and brought it through customs? How stupid is that?

I can't even hear myself think.

The art world doesn't fully appreciate my talent yet. I needed some way to pay the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay well for information.

Casandra. Old girlfriend?

You got it in a bar?

Sorry.   I didn't mean to pry.

I'm sorry things went so wrong today.

I really thought we had something special going. I can't tell you what a disappointment you've turned out to be.

Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating you all right? Food okay?

For me? What am I going to do with a piece of shit like this?

I don't care about your sword.

On guard!

It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?

Are you related to Li Mu Bai?

Do you know her?

I'll socialize with whomever I please.

But I have had much practice.  As a child in the West, a platoon lived with us.  They'd let me play with their weapons.  The scabbard is so beautiful.

You write gracefully.  Calligraphy is so similar to fencing.

Please.

I'll give them to you.

Where is he now?

Mu Bai...It's been too long.

Why?  You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.

Join me once you have finished.  I can wait for you in Peking.

Sir Te believes it's a ploy cast suspicion on Governor Yu.

Jade Fox?  Impossible.

So I shall avenge my master's death after all.

It was Bo, Sir Te's man.  I hear he followed the thief to the Yus'.

Giang Hu is a world of tigers and dragons, full of corruption... I tried sincerely to give it up but I have brought us only trouble.

I'll look around and catch up later.

Maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same.

It's Jade Fox!

This is Li's personal sword, a great hero's weapon!  He is the only one in the world worthy of carrying it.  It's too fine a gift. I cannot accept it.

You've always been so good to Li Mu Bai and me.  Please accept our thanks.

Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?

Whatever it is, the answer's no, Eddie.  I'm too busy tonight.

Speak up.  Clear it with the Captain if you need a file.

Are you nuts, walking into a gun?

Listen:  Top Dollar.  He "owns the street here."  He will "erase my ass."

My name.

Thank you.  For giving a damn.

It's done. ALBRECHT I figured as much.  Did you cap off Funboy.

Hey, Darla -- before we die of old age, how about it --?

Oh wow, oh wow, don't fucking do that, man.  I nearly had a fucking heart attack.

It's just the dope, don't worry

I remember him!  Here, Gabriel... here kitty... Gabriel... Is he still yours?

What's goin' on, Elly?

Well, how's your friend?

A year ago.  Halloween.  A man and a woman.  In a loft.  You helped to murder them.

You cut her.  You raped her.  You watched!

Who gives a fuck!  I'm a businessman.  You gonna do me, then do me and shut you're face!

Top Dollar.

I believe our friend Elly call you Mister Crow.  Please acknowledge; the mike will pick you up.

Do this thing and you will be vulnerable.  The blood will not return.  No powers.  No reunion.  Nothing.

Don't waste my time.

...necklace... pearls...

Do you know of spirit assassins? You do know the dead can rise? Properly motivated, of course.

Have we met?

Did you know Sebastian well?

Thank you.

Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.

You heard me.

His journal. He sent it to me the day before he died. Everything about you is in it. The blow jobs, the hand jobs, the menages, your bout with bulimia, the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you... eww. Let's see, then there's your coke problem... You still keep it in your crucifix, don't you? It's all in there.

Are you often this offensive on a first encounter?

Oh really?

Who the hell is taking the time to write letters, spreading this shit about me?

Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're not going to be friends.

I sincerely doubt it.

About what?

And that's a bad thing?

That's none of your business.

And you promise to abide by it?

No, not at all.

Sure. Have a good night.

Need any company?

I don't know? Maybe I'd like it. I'm trying to change here. You could be supportive.

No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me.

Lighten up.

I just came to say goodbye.

How am I a hypocrite?

Please don't go.

This isn't working out for me anymore.

Why aren't you understanding?

It's a beautiful home you have here Mrs. Rosemond.

My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his farm so I would come over and ride all the time.

Unbelievable. Some fag, no offense -

Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?

Really. You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf?

I think he's telling the truth Valmont. Greg couldn't write a grocery list let alone a letter.

Where did you find those?

I'm in the bath, mom.

I'll call you later and we'll get together and plan your curriculum.

What are you saying?

Who is it?

Why didn't you do something?

I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a woman.

Now listen. Now that you're on your way, it would be stupid of you to stop. Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him instruct you.

I look terrible.

What are you doing?

But -

Need any company?

Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.

Greg, is that you under the covers?

Whoa!

She bought it.

Is she with you?

Hello.

Hi Kathryn. Is everything okay?

I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to.

Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and --

Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. When I get through with her, she'll be the premier Blow Job Queen of the Tri-State area and poor little Court's heart will be shattered.

Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer?

In English.  I'll fuck your brains out.

Fuck her yet?

Interesting.

No.

Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.

I'm at your service.

That her?

Shut up.

Nothing.

If your asking if I nailed her the answer is no.

I don't know. She was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I was... I just didn't feel right about it.

Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.

I'm not in the mood.

Well done.

I'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed.

You're too kind.

What about her?

Let me get that for you.

Hi. Is Annette at home?

I said, do you want some water?

Did she show up?

Wow. I never knew she had these kind of feelings.

Where the hell do you come off hitting women?

Did you hit her?

I love the smell of pine.

Did you ever make a wish?

Edward will give you your breakfast, Amy.

Where'd you get this, darling?

She was very pretty.

Look! Why don't you run out and play? The sun's shining.

Well, it shows imagination, anyhow.

I'd hate her to grow up like that.

All I have to do is look at Amy's eyes, blue and deep like yours.

Where is everybody?

It's nearly a quarter after four. The party was for four, wasn't it?

Oilie, that's for the children to play with.

All right, Ollie.  Go ahead. Call the Boyds...3000W...see if their darling Donald has left.

No, darling, I hadn't intended to.

What do you want. Amy?

What do you mean you didn't play with the other children?

Now Amy

And who did the voice belong to?

Now look, this is the last time you come to me with any such stories  I'm sick of this sort of thing.

It isn't a secret. She plays with me. She plays with me in the garden all the time. Right out there in the garden, she does!

But where is that?

Not even Daddy...or Mommy?

But you must!

Oh, how beautiful!

It stands so still.

It's a pretty ring.

Been crying? That won't please your Daddy. You'd bettor cheer yourself up.

You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships for your Dad.

About time for you to come home, Amy.

Little miss, don't you never come here alone. You gave me a fright, you did.

There was a deer on the other side of the fence.

Mustn't look, little miss. Mustn't look.

Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.

There you are. Take some cake, why don't you?

I like stories.

And does he kill people?

Hurry, hurry.

You didn't even open my present and I'm your daughter.

Oh, doesn't that prove something to you? Doesn't it?

Promise me you won't forget tomorrow. You'll remember, won't you? You won't say that it was just a dream. Promise me.

Good night, mother, good night.

On the dark nights  on the stormy nights -- you can hear him. He passes like the wind; The flapping and fluttering of his great cloak beating like gaunt wings. The thunder of his horse's hooves is loud, loud and louder, beating hard, beating strong on the frozen ground as he comes riding, riding, riding.

There's a present you haven't opened yet, ma'am.

Everything all right down there at the school, Mr. Reed?

When I first heard all that talk about you going down to the school to see the teacher I got really afeard.  I thought maybe you night call off this birthday party -- and me with the cake already in the oven.

No. Amy slapped Donald because he had hurt the butterfly -- and it was her friend.

You'd better hurry.  I've left Amy in the car and she's getting impatient.  She tells me there's something especially important about a sixth birthday.

No way is that the same chick. The other one was a dog.

No one I've run into knows what "coyote ugly" means.

Yul Brynner. They're all dead.

That bite healed up quickly. It's been about three weeks?

Jennifer?

Translation: a total geek.

My date always pays more attention to you than to me.

Sorry. It's just so bad lately. You're so lucky you never get PMS.

Or if there's a full moon.

It's not about him seeing you in it. It's how you feel. You'll feel sexy in lingerie and it'll show. It's an inner thing.

I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.

Why would they exaggerate?

What? Why the hell did he do that?

I thought you were going to stop wearing your glasses.

He was cute, huh? Of course whenever I meet a guy, I'm wearing no make-up.

Gross, so this is Mark's flesh? When did you see him?

I don't know much about him. How do you know if a guy is decent?

Oh my god, look. My arms are so hairy!

So where's this infamous arm now?

And what makes you think you killed a man?

Maybe the blood was from your period like before.

Holy shit, I don't know.

What happened to his tooth?

If you ask me, the fucker got what he deserved. I'm glad he's dead.

"Paranoia, insecurity, depression, changes in vision, feelings of losing control; belief that you have a mental problem..." Nothing about turning into a werewolf.

Fall in love.

I'm cleaning my stove.

I think George knows.

About Benito.

I do development for TV movies.

I'm really tired.

Look what you did!

Where'd you get the bike?

Wow.

How about a "Man in Jeopardy" story?

I can't read any more crap. These women are all victims.

I think we should do something with strong female characters...

Mr. Grant. Did you read that script I was talking about?

No.

I wish I could help but last I saw Gregory was outside my front door.

Being a cop has such a warm effect on people.

You wanna get some coffee?

Okay well. Maybe some other time. They continue walking together.

Everything okay?

But you said the bodies were ripped to pieces?

I need to talk to you. About us. Frida... I... Can I carry your box?

You didn't say it.

I did shave... Do I seem hairy? Peter laughs.

You at least owe me the truth.

I knew you wouldn't kill me.

Dreams about killing usually signify feelings of guilt. You had sex last night and you feel guilty.

It's about Gregory Jameson. He's dead.

Oh great. What the fuck am I supposed to do?

Nah, I don't wanna break up with Wanda, I just wanna see Carmen too.

You kiddin'? They try to get ME drunk.

He was found a few blocks away.

Hell no, I'm not into that shit. The sight of blood makes me sick.

Maybe. What about all those hairs they found on his body?

Sounds like you got a conflict of interest.

What kind of animal?

Sell maps?

The city.  I need to get to the ocean.

Mnunn.  Cold lately.  That night, couple weeks ago.  That was <u>real</u> cold.  Remember that?

I met a friend of yours the other night, doctor.  Tall fellow.  No hair.  Rather pale skin...

That's surprising.  He was leaving your office at the time...

Yes, sir.  I'm sorry...  But I don't understand how it was possible.  The only window was twenty feet up a vertical wall, he was cuffed...

Iím your new assistant.

Iíve taken the liberty and had Inspector Thompsonís office searched, as I believe you instructed.  All clear now, sir.  They found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories... Poor man.

Who is it?

I need everything on the Jonathan White case.

I don't know who they are.

They didn't have faces.

Go on.

But...  How long has this been happening?

Look!  This is a good one!

Such a joker!  Like your father.

A fanciful idea, Mister White.

Someoneís after me.

Donít kill me!

Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it?  Is there nothing <u>you</u> remember?  Not even a detail?   You must try.

What does she say?  The woman.

Your name is John White.

If you would only take this, inject it in your brain, everything would be much clearer.

It's a trick.

What happened to you?

I thought it would make more sense. I'm getting the pieces, but when I put it together it feels like... Like you're telling me about somebody else's life...

You understand what you'll be doing?

Holy cow.

I'm not certain about...

Uh, Mr. President... I don't believe that's on your agenda today.

.. Nothing.

Die, you pond scum!

Where's the girl?

I don't give a shit.

Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...

Her?... Oh -- the First Lady...  She was giving that commencement speech up in Bryn Mawr.  I managed to catch her before she left the hotel.

I told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at  `the hotel.' She seems to hate him more than ever.

It's gonna be great.  'Caring about his wife.'  'Spending time on her favorite issue...'

What's with the cameras?

What are you gonna do?

He's not a President! He's an ordinary person.  I can kill an ordinary person.

Are you threatening me?

So you want to go swimming?

I just think they make this stuff a lot more complicated than it has to be.

Well, yeah.  But you gotta start making some choices.

Thanks, I wrote it.

Dave...

I thought you said I wasn't going to see her.

Yeah, but the First Lady... Couldn't we start with a cousin or something?

President vetoes works bill?

`Dave'?

Yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.

Yes, but I wouldn't...

This is from the people of Burundi...

Mr. President, may I speak frankly with you?

One day my wife says to me 'Why don't you try running for office.  You talk about it all the time, why don't you just do it?'  So I tell my boss I have a dentist appointment and I go down to the registrar of voters on my lunch break.  Next thing I know, I'm a councilman.

Really?

You mean you don't know or like -- you can't say.

Huh.  You know what I always wondered the way they say you guys'd take a bullet for the President.

You mean with you and everything?

I care about the homeless.

... . Ellen.

That was quite a thing you did today.

Kind of reminds me of that thing you did back in the state legislature.

You're leaving?

You sure this goes somewhere?

You don't have to keep walking with me.   I'm okay from here.

Yes.

It was okay?

Well I guess...

What?

What's wrong?

I never thought I'd...

Who's this priest I'm thanking?

Oh yeah.  Did you take care of later on?

Please....shoot me.

I don't believe you, rebel. Where are your headquarters? On the mainland?

It's some kind of....elevator. There must be something under the ground here....maybe....military.

What do we do? Let'em know we're here....or what?

I know it hurts. But it won't be long. Then all the pain will be over. Oh, I wish you could hear me. GOD, GIVE HER THE EARS TO HEAR ME SO SHE KNOWS I DON'T WANT HER TO HURT SO!

Miss Henried, I think you better...

Sir. It's quite clear that...

Curse?

Toby's right. They're not gonna sit around with their fingers up their asses while we bust up their toys.

What is it?

I'm gonna have this stuff sent over to the hospital...

What'dya tell that soldier, soldier? You tell him we was rebels?

That entrance is closest to the labs and the Bee cages.

That's the general alarm. Jesus! They musta got in!

But...we bury the heads. Oh. God! It must be torture for them!

TONY....TONY....

You can't run away from the planet, Miss Science. You can't even run away from the island, heh heh.

Where are you going, Tyler?

It's been fired.

You know how many demerits we're talking?

I'm in as long as we're careful.

They're townies?!

I don't know.  I don't get it.

Well hell no, Charlie, but that's not the point.  That's not the point at all!

Oh come on, Cameron, don't you get anything?

All right.  I'll try anything once.

But what if they see it, Nuwanda?

Mr. Keating!

Yeah!    Don't you guys miss having girls here?

Every guy that I meet wants me for one thing my body.  You're not like that.

Welcome. back, Mr. Dalton.  How's your father?

Yes sir.  We were just talking about that.

Well, Meeks aced Latin and I didn't quite flunk English so if you want, we've got our study group.

Hey, he's your roommate.

I went to the woods because I wanted to live deliberately."  I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life!"

Nuwanda, what is going on?

Where'd you find them?

Why don't you talk to Mr. Keating about it?

That's your sister school, right?

Well, sure!

Oh, hi.  I'm glad you made it.  Did you bring anybody?

If Chet sees you, he'll kill you, don't you know that?

But I love you.

Of course just like that.  That's how you always know when it's right.

Look, I've got to go.  I'm gonna be late for the play.

Knox, you are so infuriating!

Oh Captain, My Captain.  What if we don't know anything about someone like Rahesh Non?

This was my first classroom, John, did you know that?  My first desk.

Boys marching.  Clapping in unison.

A yawp?

Mr. Keating? Sir? Oh Captain My Captain.  What was the Dead Poets Society?

What did the name mean.  Did you only read dead poets.

Oh Captain, My Captain, we came here so I could talk to you about something.

Gosh, they don't give you much room around here, do they?

Why do you do it?  I mean, with all this seize-the-day business, I'd have thought you'd be out seeing the world or something?

Give your father the benefit of the doubt.  Talk to him.  Let him see who you are.

Damn.  Damn!  If I could just get Chris to read this poem!

They're friends of my dad.  Probably in their nineties or something.

You know what the dead poets would say: Gather ye rosebuds while ye may...

But father, I'm assistant editor.

I will not be disputed in public, do you understand me?

When you've finished medical school and you're on your own, you can do as you please.  Until then, you will listen to me.

Don't you dare talk back to me!  It's bad enough that you've wasted your time with this absurd acting business.  But you deliberately deceived me!  Who put this in your head? How did you expect to get away with it? Answer me!

What is it then?

Why don't you ask him first?  Maybe he'll say yes.

From you?

This is your desk set.  I don't get it.

Well, maybe they thought you'd need another one.  Maybe they thought...

Lots of girls.  The girl who plays Hermia is incredible.

You the Captain?

We don't even know if his boat is still there...you saw Billy!

Who gives a shit about aft?

You trying to take over my show Finnegan, that what you trying to do?

I was born in a City housing project in the Bronx OK? It's not in the cards that I die on a luxury cruise ship...now which way up?

Hey! Hey! Where are you going?

But what makes you think there aren't more of those...things...back there?

You don't have to be so touchy.

So this boat of yours...that's what you do? Give people...rides.

Seen a lot of islands?

Boat or no boat... You woulda come back anyway. You're that kind of gal.

What is it?

Finnegan...

You want ME to go up there?

Where's you friend?

Shut up! You hear me!!

Here's what I think...I think these mokes below are a hit sqaud.

Sure I do...I give a shit that at 0300 hour we reach our point of dentination. I give a shit that those mojos got to do what they got to do, and 45 minutes later we are turn around and gone. I give a shit that by the time the sun comes up we are all safely tucked in bed.

I think he knows that Joey.

Not even a Joey, I'm glad to see you? Joey, what happened to your leg?

Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?

Can somebody tell me what the object of the exercise is here?

I think we gotta stop floating from one fucked up situation to the next...

And what have you come up with?

Why don't you back off?

What was that?

Someone's back there.

Check it out!

Maybe it's the wrong ship.

She fucked you?

Fuel up. Need fuel.

You want 'em?

That's mustard!

Here's to huntin'.

Who's full of shit?

Fuckin' guy's been shooting slants, Albert! I mean, what do you think?

Tell him, Vince!

Hey, Nick, I mean... This here is for the guy that gets caught!

You're full of shit, Vince! You're so full of shit you're going to float away!

That's new, isn't it?

Whee-uu!

I got delayed. I --

He's serious. Vince is fuckin' serious!

Fucking A.

He's real bad, Nick.

Sure. Why not.

No. None of that.

You like to call me Linda now?

Sure! I got eight hundred potatoes says he goes one more... He retired, you know.

Why?... What do you mean?... Why???

Biederman! Where's Biederman!

Please! Please mister, please! This is vital I go to Saigon. This is very important. Most important.

That I must not tell you. Top secret. You see there. Topmost secret.

What kind of beer would you like?

I thought... Oh, Nick, I thought you were hurt, some accident. Maybe you fell or maybe some car...  I thought someone stole you away!

No-o-o!

You seem... disturbed.

Mais certainment... A great deal of money. Naturally I do not do it myself. I myself do not possess the nerve.  But I am always... how do you say... looking out for those who do... It is a thing quite rare. Champagne perhaps? Tch, tch. Don't say no. When a man says no to champagne, he says no to life and that no man must ever do.  Where did you play?

How extremely clever. That is really most extraordinaire... Allow me please to introduce myself. I am Armand... And you are?

Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have to do it.

So do I.  I want to be ready... You have to be ready... It has to be there, in your mind.

Fucking A.

What do you think about?

Promise! You gotta promise!

Hey, Nick?

I'm telling you, Nick, no one's going to come.

We gotta play with more bullets.

More bullets in the gun... The trouble is that still leaves one of us with his hands tied up, so that means we gotta play each other.

No way. No fucking way!

I did. I... This is stolen. I came back.

I like it, Nick.

Here, here! This is it!

Sure I got boots. I got boots right here.

No.

Don't worry what it says in the book.

What?

Sal, you're gonna die! You're gonna sit in that corner watching soaps and you're gonna die!... I'm not saying it's gonna be the same. It's not gonna be the same, but whatever it's gonna be we're all gonna do it, Sal. God damn it we are! We are gonna do it!

Maybe you could use socks, Nick. Jesus, I mean, come to think of it socks are pretty expensive now.

It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.

Well... Phantom Mary's on my mother's side. Naturally no one there admits it because Phantom Mary's pretty weird... You want to hear the whole story?

Six or eight.  And they go wild?

Looks like ya gonna take office just in time, Chief.  Things need straightening up in this city.

Witnesses say some wacko went Judge hunting with a late model.  I got an artist working on a computer composite now.

Talk fast.  Polls open in half an hour.

Michael called yesterday.  He wants to take Willy for the summer.

Mug sheets.

I don't want to hear anymore.

Doucet's just offed two of the jurors who put him away.  I'm rounding up the rest of them and putting them in police custody.  What's your status?

You two fucks listen up.  Doucet's killing people and you're wasting valuable time busting two-bit Technothugs.

Just great.

Sir, your limo's here.

Okay, that's all folks.  Commissioner Gallagher has to go.

Maybe I should put on the training whe---

No offense, but why'd they partner me with a rookie?

I'll inform dispatch.

Can I ask you something?

Then what goes on in there?  What I mean is, what are you thinking about?

Give me a break.  I'm serious. What's it like to be dead?

How then?

Wanna try?

Get us some fuck'n back-up now!

What's this?

You okay?

What are you doing this for, Sanchez?

Seat's too high.

Yes.

Bye.  Thanks.

Golly, Belle, that was a good idea -- we should do that every morning.

You're not resting well, are you? I know -- it's that music.  You need your sleep. Is there anything else you want?

You think you're so smart, Mrs. Stone. You wanted to be near Jabez. It looked like your big chance tonight, but you're wrong, you can't win him back -- not that way.

And two unpara-- unparalleled Cir-cass-ian beauties? What is that?

Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses!

But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't.

Yes, you did, Daniel! I saw it from the window. And then to lie about it! Give me that beanshooter, Daniel!

But I like the new one better.

Well -- here's how it is ...Tom Sharp, Eli Higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about -- that new sort of organization -- grange they call it. What you think about it?

Stevens!

I barely managed to scrape up a bit for you. I thought if I made a kind of part payment --

-- in gold.

Where's everybody?

Afraid ... of what?

Do you deny that you called me? I've known people in other States who went back on their word. But I didn't expect it in New Hampshire.

Yes, why shouldn't it?

What does it mean here -- about my soul?

Excellent. A firm, fair signature. One that will last till doomsday.  My dear Neighbor Stone, I congratulate you! You're going to be the richest man in New Hampshire! 

Yes, indeed. But not now. Not for seven years. Oh, I almost forgot -- what is the date?

Oh come, Neighbor Stone. I wouldn't cut that tree if I were you. It means a breach of contract.

But you should, now that you are becoming a father.

Why, Mr. Stone, you look so worried. Can I be of any service?

Are they all as -- small -- as that?

Trying to break our contract again, Mr. Stone?

What a headstrong fellow! Well -- I guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences.

I don't seem to be so very popular after all -- in Cross Corners.

Here's a man who knows what's good for Dan'l Webster! Medford rum! Ah, a breath of the Promised Land!  To the champion of the Iron Horseshoe, Jabez Stone!

There's nothing like it. I saw an inchworm take a drop of it once, and he stood right up on his hind legs and bit a bee. Come -- try a nip!

You were worried, Jabez, weren't you?

Ma says breakfast's ready, Mr. Webster!

Well, Jabez -- I'm a little pressed for time. You wanted to discuss something -- some business --

Dan'l Webster?

The only one you missed -- is the President.

Yes  siree -- that's the idea. Get them all here and then say: "Look, folks -- here's Daniel Webster, my guest of honor." Golly, I can see their eyes pop already.

That's fine. Now you can tell people all about the house, but don't mention Webster.

I think his leg is broken.

" ... and if the final vote shall leave thousands of our fellow citizens and their families in hopeless distress, can we -- members of the Government -- go to our beds with a clear conscience, can we, without self- reproach, supplicate the Almighty Mercy to forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors?

Yes -- I had to pay the vet in full. He just wouldn't have treated the horse this time. After all, we can't very well do without a horse.

Mary, I'm a farmer -- always will be. To me seed isn't a thing to pay debts with, it's alive, more alive than anything -- but I guess you're right. We just got to do it. Oh -- how's it all going to end?

I'll get the doctor.

Mary -- what would you do with a pot o' gold?

There's hope and promise in it, Jabez -- Planting and promise of good harvest to come.

Mary --

That's one thing I want to talk to you about, Mary.

Ruined -- all the fields -- ruined. 

Mary --

Potato bug sits on the leaf in the sun, Sleep, sleep, my baby -- Raccoon sits in the spruce all night, Sleep, baby, sleep --

What happened.... Where are you taking him?

Jabez -- how can you let her talk like that when the boy is present? He won't respect me any more.

Mary! Come back ...

You must go now, Mary -- you must!

You found it in the barn, hey?

You see, son? I'm old and I've lived. When a man gets his money in bad ways -- when he sees the better course and takes the worse -- then the devil is in his heart -- and that fixes him.

Now that's the way to talk, Son! I know you worked hard for that crop. But we'll make out.

Golly, Ma --  Consarn that music! Shouldn't a-had the harvest festival tonight.

Wish I could really do something for you. But you know Stevens. He'll throw you off your farm tomorrow if you don't pay him tonight.

Be sure to let me know if Daniel is over there.

Well Mary, it's too bad I didn't know -- I would have given you a real dinner, but with my wife being in Washington -- Have another piece of pie -- 

Mary -- you've talked to me as you might have talked to your father and I believe he wants me to help you a little. You see, sometimes we think we're licked in this life -- but we weren't put here to be licked. Don't you believe it. Sometimes the shadows seem to get hold of us -- the shadows and the evil -- but it is still up to us to fight. Now I was thinking before you came, of coming over to Cross Corners end of the month, to get acquainted with my Godson -- and other things.

Jabez ...

The quick or the dead! You have said it.  May -- the best man win, Mr. Webster!

I want someone to talk to ...

So, you go on upstairs to the party, your lady sees you, you run into each other's arms.  Music comes up, you live happily ever after, that it?

I'm Special Agent Johnson of the FBI. This is Agent Johnson...no relation.

One of yours?

I know what you are feeling.  But this is not productive --

It's beautiful.  I always enjoyed models as a boy.  The exactness, the attention to every foreseeable detail... perfection.

I don't know it!  get on a Goddamn jet to Tokyo and ask the chairman! I'm telling you!  You're just going to have to kill me --

Bad for your health anyway.

--ohGodplease -- don't kill me -- don't kill me -- you're one of them, I know it --

Bill, you know how to use a handgun?

Hans.  Your Hans.

Nein, dies ein ist mein.  This time John Wayne does not walk off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.

Yo!

No.  But I'll have a sofa brought out to you.  Good enough?

After all your posturing, all your speeches...you're nothing but a common thief.

What are you doing?

Didn't we have this same conversation in July?  Damn it, John, there was an opportunity out here -- I had to take it --

Excuse me, I'm looking for --

Yeah.  How'd you know?

I hear you...  Partner.  And LA's finest are on it, so light 'em if you got 'em.

I'm here, Roy, but I'm, uh, kind of busy.  Let's talk later, okay?

Safe and sound, thanks to you. What the fuck was that?

Yeah?  What's the odds?

Hey, you couldn't know.

Look...I'm getting a bad feeling up here...I'd like you to do something for me.  Look up my wife...don't ask how, you'll know by then...and tell her...tell her...I've been a jerk. When things panned out for her, I should've been behind her all the way ...We had something great going until I screwed it up...She was the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me.  She's heard me say I love you a thousand times, but she never got to hear this...honey...I'm sorry.  You get all that?

I am, Sir...Sergeant Al Powell.

I don't think so, Sir.  In fact... I think he's a cop.  Maybe not LAPD, but definitely a badge.

These seats come out?

Jesus, you're the man!

You'll be okay.

Jesus - what - I'm afraid - I'm gonna get shot or whatever.  You oughta see it on TV, the guns, the cops, they got cannon, machine guns, they're loaded with gear.

Jesus Christ is coming back and he's really pissed.

Hello.  Hello, Leon.

I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing.  And we're gonna go, man!

So!  Sal is with you?

Sal... Sal... Naturale, oh boy!

Yeah... I knew it.  But, what choice do I have?  I'm in the hospital; they drag me out of the hospital... bring me down here...

Yeah... yeah.

Yeah... see ya in my dreams, huh?

Yeah.

You alone, or you got confederates?

Right -- got ya.  Okay, so there's you -- what's your name?

Give me a name, any name, just so I got somethin' to call you.

Sonny-boy, one word?

Let Sal come out, take a look. What hope you got?  Quit while you're ahead.  All you got is attempted robbery.

I want a helicopter to get outa here!  And a jet to take us to...  ... wherever we want to go.  Outa the country, so no little jets.  A big one with a bar and a piano lounge.

Sonny, be reasonable!

Yeah ...

You know, you're telling me that a helicopter can't land here ...

All right ... I got some hungry people in there ... I want to get some pizza ... some stuff like that ...

Cokes, seven-ups ...  also some aspirin ...

Okay, is the vault open?

I must of been outta my mind.

The gun's right on your back...

Hello, Mulvaney here...

I swear to God... on my salary, I'm not gonna be any hero...

Where's the back door?

Let's go to the back door.  How'd that guy get to be a guard?

Don't ask me questions.  I got connections.  You find out who I am, you're cold meat.

You know - I had a job once.  I used to work in a bank.  I had been training ... I used to have a boss ... Mr. Don Frio ... he wore a toupee ... I wonder if you'd hire me if I came in here and asked you for a job ...

Yeah.

I wish somebody would tell me I'm gonna live long enough for it to be a habit.  My parent, she'll be okay. My husband, he'll be okay.  I even know who the bum is gonna marry. Terrific.  She'll take good care of him.

Because I don't want cancer.

You shouldn't start now.

You're really pure, you know?  You got a perfect record.  You never used that stuff to ruin your body, why start now?

To show that we're negotiating.



Sonny -

Sal?

Just give me a receipt.  Hey, Sal, you okay?

Hey, Sonny - You did it!

Aw, Jesus ... you been doin' us favors all night!

Bullshit!

I want to come in, and see if everybody's okay.

Jesus, you'd like to kill me, too.

Nobody give their right name ... it's the FBI!

What's wrong?

That's the jet.  You give us one more, now.  That's the deal...

Okay, who's the head teller here?

Oh - Maria!

Don't talk to them anymore.  Sal and me are getting a jet, we're going to Algeria - I'll write you from there.

For God's sake don't start in on Heidi again ...

What the hell for?  Twenty-five years in the pen?

Did Pop come down?

Newsman, not ...

Of course not ...

This is Drake Bishop.

What happened to my money, Mr. Williams? <b> INT. CLAREMONT WILLIAMS III BOND AGENCY -- NEXT </b> Claremont sits behind his desk with his phone to his ear.

What is it, Choco?

Tell him it's not cute. Will you tell him, Domino!?

Yes.

Many times.

We're late.

Listen, dick-fuck. I had a good run while it lasted. Now I've got ten million in the bank. <i>I'll never have to work again for the rest of my life.</i>

We didn't sign on for this shit.  Fuck! This shit is intense. I need to call my agent.

This could break new ground in terms of traditional host models. It's self-reflexive reality television.

I don't like anything else.

Every single one of those pictures is somebody Italian.

And I--we--want some Black people up.

Extra cheese is two dollars. Y'know dat.

What da fuck!  Are you deaf?

Mookie.

Buggin' Out, I gotta work here.

You the man.

You a dumb-ass simple motherfucker. Where did you read that?

How long?

No!

Eddie Lovell.

Don't you have enough sense not to bother people when they're sleeping?

Jade.

Is this another one of your patented two-hour lunches?

I just don't want you to lose the one job you've been able to keep, that's all.  I'm carrying you as it is.

Hurry up and get dressed.

No.

No, you're tripping.  Don't come in Sal's.  Alright, read my lips.

Oh, it doesn't, huh!  You got your little 250 dollars a week plus tips...

...peanuts.

Jade, you're late.

Twenty "D" Duracells.

WAKE UP!

It's Miller time.  Let me go give these Koreans s'more business.

Why you gotta talk 'bout my moms?

Sal, just this once, do me that solid.

I would like to get paid now.

Sal, if you want me to deliver any faster, get me a jet rocket or something, cuz I can't run with pizzas, all the cheese ends up on one side and shit.

C'mon, Sal.

Whatdafuck do you want?

Doctor, always try to do the right thing.

Before I get off work.

And I really wanted some ice cream too.

Why you gotta curse?

Mookie, you must think I'm stupid or something.  You're gonna run outta here and I won't see your black ass for another week.

Act like one then.  Be a man.

Give dat bum a dollar for sweeping our sidewalk.  What do we pay Mookie for?  He don't even work.  I work harder than him and I'm your own son.

Pino, I think secretly that you wish you were Black.  That's what I think.  Vito, what do you say?

Mister Señor Love Daddy is cool.

That's what you think?

Pino, I work hard like everybody in here.

I'll be back after I make this delivery.

That's the dope.

I love you, my brother.

Fuck you and stay off the phone.

Hey!  Watch it.

I should have Vito go with you all the time.

Couldn't we sell this and open up a new one in our own neighborhood?

I didn't think so.

Vito!  Pino!  Let's go.

I've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper. It was either a feature on you or the new four-color ink pens at the student store.

Yeah, well, I'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. But, I chose you and that's fine.  I'm Jessica Matthews.

Oh Harry, you're so funny. Now I have something that's kind of delicate...

HARRY? Are you okay?

What?

We've got some margarine too if you'd like to scoop it out of the tub.

Is it true what you said to Captain Rob?

Wow, a treasure map! What's the treasure?

No thanks, not hungry. Harry Dunne. Why does that name not sound familiar?

What?

...oh also, we even have a slogan. 'S' and 'P' stands for 'Special People', which is the kind of kids we are. 'A' and 'Z' is for 'Aren't Zeros' because that is less then one, and when you put it all together it spells...

Maybe we should ask Jessica to join the class.

What? No no. He's got a parrot on his shoulder, buries treasure...

Who knows? Maybe someday I'll be your new daddy.

You're it.

You're it.

These are really cold, huh?

I don't know. Owwww.

...cause you said...

Sure I do. On one condition.

Oh hey Lloyd, why are you here?

HARRY, can you hear me?

Sure, I like a woman with some meat on her bones.

LLOYD, what are you doing? That's JESSICA and... my mom.

A raft.

George Washington!

Wow, we built a whole float in one afternoon. And now the reward.

If you have to ask, you don't know.

Are, too.

You found my treasure? Why didn't you tell me.

Enough! Look what this cursed chest is doing to us.

Hey Lloyd. This looks like another one of your mix tapes.

Oh my God! She's two-timing PRINCIPAL COLLINS!

Hold up. First, we have to decide who gets who, remember? No more competition?

MS. HELLER, mind if I tag along on your field trip? I'm thinking of doing a story on your special needs class.

Are you wearing a coconut bra?

I thought I told you to get lost.

Well, what have we here? It appears be a tape.

Being a jerk doesn't make you special.

Why ith dat newth?

Yes, what?

Well I was born in St. Louis.

HARRY and I have been talking about school. In fact, I want to ask you something.

... If I may quote the twentieth century poet  - Joe Piscahpo:  You look Marvelous...

Well I need to get a job and you're telling me that if I join up - I can really come and go whenever I want?

You really are a pirate.

Sure.

Thanks for the grub, Mrs. D. Where's Mr. D?

What are you crazy kids doing in my tool shed?

Obviously.

Well you know Detective, he's expecting  'Moffit' to be someone who has... certain... well...

You know honey, I've finally figured out a way of bilking enough money from the school to get us that condo in Waikiki.

Times two.

So the chest is still out there somewhere.

I sold all the wind instruments.  Hawaiian Air, business class. And you like that new fur coat?

The Atreides will be leaving Caladan soon, Baron, and I have here your answer from Duke Leto.

My thanks.

What happens now?

I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished.

He will not permit anyone but me to see him. You must be outside this room.... Do what you can.

Yes, Sire.

We'd have joined each other in death. However, you did seem to finally get the "mood".

Paul, this is the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam. She is going to... observe you...  Please... -- REVEREND MOTHER Jessica, you know it must be done. I enjoin you to stand guard at the door and practice the meditation of peace.

You've worn a stillsuit before?

Why do they come?

Spice!... pure un-refined spice!

You have strength... real strength... You shall be known as Usul, which is the strength of the base of the pillar.  This is your secret name in our troop.  But you must choose the name of manhood which we will call you openly.

Water on Arrakis!!! I have seen this place in a dream.  A treasure.

Long live the fighters!

What's in the box?

 I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear... I will permit it to pass over me and through me. -- The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly. She is smiling.

The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot.

Mr. <u>Lugosi</u>!  It is an unparalleled privilege to meet you.  Allow me to introduce myself... I am CRISWELL!

Bring me two more Beefeater martinis. Eddie will have another whiskey, Dagmar's a Rum-and-coke, Moustapha and King are chablis -- hey Bela, would you like a wine?

So <u>you</u> sleep in coffins?!

Excuse me, Mr. Lugosi??

No.  I don't work here.

Why were you buying a coffin?

I thought it was great.  You were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie.

Boy, Mr. Lugosi, you must lead such an exciting life.  When is your next picture coming out?

Shh!  I'm coming!  I will feed you!

Are you sure this is okay?

Eddie, what kind of movie is this?

Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.

Bela! It's so great to see you!  And eight o'clock on the dot.  Right on time!

Of course!  Well, we got a big day planned for you... First, we're gonna start off a little easy, with you in that armchair over there.  Then, once you're up to speed and cooking, we'll reset and bring out the laboratory equipment --

Uh, a cop.  NO!  You play the father. He's <u>angry</u>!  He doesn't like seeing his son -- no -- he doesn't like seeing his <u>daughter</u> behave this way!

Sure.  Romance, that's great!  To engineer your comeback, we're gonna need a whole slate of pictures.  Once "Glen Or Glenda" takes off, we'll slam you into one, then another, then another!

"Greetings.  I am the Count."

Bela, don't worry.  You're better than all this crap.

Was I wrong to cast Loretta?

Eddie, I'm so tired... I don't know if I can handle a night shoot...

Let's shoot this fucker!  Where do I go?

Okay!  How do we turn this thing on?

Don't worry.

Okay.  But what if I'm not in <u>too</u> big a hurry?  What if I take a moment to slow down and savor the beauty of life?  To smell a flower?

And, cut...

Sorry...

I've never seen anything like him!

Um, okay... roll camera

You don't understand!  The octopus is supposed to live in a <u>lake</u>!

H-how'd you know?!

Hey Cris, how'd you know we'd be living on Mars by 1970?  How'd you know it wouldn't be 1975, or even 1980?

Bravo!  Bravo!  Magnifico!

Edward, are you sure you know what you're doing?

No.  They say his eligibility ran out years ago.

Dolores, give me your shoes.

Yeah!  I met a movie star!  Somebody <u>really big</u>!

No!  A horror movie star!

No!  He's very alive.  Well... sort of.  He's old, and frail -- but he's still Bela Lugosi!  And he's really nice.

How long have you been doing this?

It's a damn good role.

Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS!

I'm no good.

Ed, the landlord doesn't care.

So my associate Mr. Marco tells me you may be interested in investing in a motion picture.

For this one, we need $60,000.

Perhaps you'd like to look at the photoplay.

Yeah?  Well now he's a junkie.  He don't deserve to work.

Screen Classics?  Hmm, don't know them.

Mr. Wood?!

Glad you could fit me in your schedule.

Well, I think you'd be a sensation in pictures.

Tor, I should be getting home.

I can't believe it.  These sound like <u>my</u> problems!

Ain't that the truth!  I've even bad producers recut my movies --

And they always want to cast their buddies -- it doesn't even <u>matter</u> if they're right for the part!

Mr. Welles, is it all worth it?

It opens in nine weeks in Tulsa.

Mr. Weiss, I was thinkin' about what you said, about how all your movies have to make a profit.  And I realized, what's the one thing, that if you put in a movie, it'll be successful??

Yeah!  Five pages right before it ends!  The rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters.

And what's with this new title?!  My poster says "I CHANGED MY SEX"!

Ed!  What's with these revised pages?!  A scene in a smelting factory?  A buffalo stampede?? <u>Three-hundred soldiers storming Anzio</u> <u>Beach</u>??!  What's going on here?  I can't afford to film this nonsense!

But I'm proud.  I wrote, directed, and starred in it just like Orson Welles in "Citizen Kane"!

The marriage already ended.

Oh, it's you again.

He's better.  Thank you for asking.  How's your friend?

Oh.  I loved those shows!  "Inner Sanctum"... "The Shadow" --

Does this mean you don't like sex with girls?

Oh.  Okay.

What was that?

Look, it's Dr. Tom.  Hey, Dr. Tom!

Ed, I'm so happy for you.

No, don't worry, I moved on.  I was just calling to see if you want to attend the world premiere of my new film, "Bride Of The Monster."

Look... would it be possible to make the "Ghoul's Wife" a little less prominent, so people won't really notice me in the movie?

The set doesn't look right!  It looks too... empty.  Clutter it up.  Put a skeleton in the corner.  And what's that thing over there?

Just like I always promised.  Now you're among the immortals.  You're movie stars.

B-but it's our money --

Eddie, I'm just a small-town girl. I've never done this before.

Well, I was wondering if maybe sometime you'd like to go out, and maybe grab some dinner.

Are things gonna be okay with you and Mom? Is there anything I can --

Did you see that?

Okay, so you understand? We're installing a permanent camera in your bedroom, one in the kitchen, one in the living room, plus, of course, there'll always be a couple of steady-cams following you.

That has my work number, my home number, my pager number. I sleep three hours a night. Call me whenever you want to talk. Off the air, on the air, whenever. Okay?

How you doing, Ed?

Yeah?

They tore her dress! ...

Yeah.

Ed --

I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.

Take him off the air.

Mr. Pekurny.



According to your mother. When the paramedics got to the hotel, she told them that --

Al!

What?

You said that.

You know who we are?

We're the guys who clean up after the parade.

So he killed himself.

Hey, he cheated on her.

Well, who knows? Maybe she finally picked a winner this time.

I can't believe you're taking his side.

Oh my God. You and Al were - and that's why you threw him out.

Who?

I'm a tramp  Meet your new father. The whole nation is laughing at us!

What is she, at work?

She left. She moved. She got Fed-Ex to give her a transfer and she left. She couldn't stand it anymore. We had people, news people, regular people, just sleeping in our hallway, going through our mail, our garbage. I mean it was she couldn't take it anymore. Now I've got to move. I can't afford this place by myself.

No! I barely even mentioned -it's just that, my friends, the people at work, whoever I'm regularly in contact with they want releases from.

Our what?

Oh! Oh -- okay, now I get it. It's "Star Search." You wanted me here because the camera comes with me.

Are you asking me?

What does this mean?

Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday.

Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called "Get your shit together before it's too late."

Hey, Lou.

Are you sure about this?

Don't defend that horse's ass to me.

Oh -- Sunday is good for me to meet your folks. We get a big family audience on Sundays so it works out.

So? What do they think -- we're not kids --

...if this ...  ... weren't here... ?

A poll. "Is Shari Good Enough for Ed?" Seventy-one per cent said "no."  They hate me!

She lied to me. I mean all my life, she's telling me one story and then... it turns out to be a completely different story. Come to me at some point -- tell me the truth. No. Not in my house. The truth is a stranger. And this is why Ray and Marcia are the way they are. Marcia gets involved with all these losers and sees no problem with herself - "How do they find me" she says. Ray cheats on you and then blames me for it. I'm the only one in the family who takes any responsibility for himself... Oh, man... Are you all right?

Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.

It's not their fault.

What do you want me to do? You want me to quit the show?!

You see how people look at me. Like when they ask for my autograph or say "Hi" to me... It's like I'm a basketball player or a... you know, like I'm someone.

This is going right up your ass.

Kinda'.

That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.

Yeah, but let's stay on one subject. Whoever that person is is going to be famous. They'll be able to get whatever they want. They'll ... trust me, this is my business.

Yeah. I service video equipment.

I'm making a tape.

I got your message. Way to go!

Why do you do that?

Polish acrobat.

I mean my question is what was she doing in a bar in the first place?

Remember the last guy she got involved with? What was his name?

Richie!  She spent six months dating a criminal

What is this? What's going on, who is that?

Look, we gotta talk.

That's right. You put Cliff on television. So then he decided he was too good for her and he left.

Come on, Ma.

You know what your problem is?

And each contestant gets one of these.  An "I tried to screw a network executive" tee-shirt.

Hi, Shari.

Hello.

Who is it?

Hi.

Oh!!

Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And ... We'11 make a night of it ... okay?

What would I actually have to do to get you to sign this?

Sherry   Sherry  Sheerrry. ...

What do you mean? What kind of person am I?

It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me, the me that nobody else knows.

Around that time Diane and I were hanging out a lot at Sherry Novotny's house, giving her our love and support and helping her make it through a difficult time.

Don't you smartass me!  Don't you dare smartass me!  You just shut your mouth I  Now your mother and I have had a long talk with Halt Hendricks  --- we just got off the phone with him at home. You know, he doesn't want you back at Millard.  He's fed up with you.  Fed up!  And I don't blame him!

What?

All right.  Well, sure nice to meet you.

What?  Right.  So let's start counting.

Fine.  So do your count.  Start with president, and I'll be right back.

Mr. M.?

It happens, Larry. People make mistakes.

You know what they say about the early bird.

Tracy.

Now at the end of her junior year, Tracy was poised to win the presidency of the student body.  And so far she was running unopposed.

NO, that's fine

Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.

I guess you know why you're here

A travesty.  Huh.  That's interesting, because I think you did it.

Yes?

Handles pretty good, don't you think?

So Tracy?

What's this?

What a surprise.

That little bitch made a fool of us I want her out of the election. Getting everybody all riled up like that.  She's finished, you hear me? Washed up.

Okay.  But is this about the posters?

What is it. Tammy?

Looks at her skeptically  doesn't say a word.

Which door?

All his life.  He's tried everything.

Yep.

Fine.  Let's say all you ever knew was apples.  Apples, apples and more apples. You might think apples were pretty good, even if you occasionally got a rotten one. Then one day there's an orange. And now you can make a decision. Do you want an apple, or do you want an orange? That's democracy.

Sorry. My figures work out exactly the same as Jim's. 256 for Paul, 255 for Tracy.

Paul, will you sign my yearbook?

Hey, Tammy, guess what happened today.

Sure, Paul.  No hard feelings.

How's the left these days?

You got a brother up in Folsom.  I know because I put him there.

Somebody hit you?

Can I get you a drink?

Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?

But you did it anyway.

So you saved her.

Come in out of the rain, Bud.

In the morning.

What's going to happen to Stensland?  He'll give himself cirrhosis over this.  <u>He's one</u> <u>year from his pension</u>.

He helped me out once.  That's all.

<u>What do you want</u>?

I need you for an assignment the Chief's given me the go-ahead on. A duty few men are fit for, but you were born for.  You'll be working out of Homicide.

How what, Wendell?

Tell me about the boyfriend she had.  The one you mentioned at the morgue.

Maybe.  I don't know.

Was it... a rat?

One in six.  Where's the girl?

Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.

Dudley.

Stay smart, Bud.  We build a case. We play by the rules.

It's a suicide note.  Says he killed Jack because Jack had figured out a pornography scam Patchett was running.

Patchett's dead.  He sent you after me.  I'd say Dudley's tying up his loose ends.

They never made a match on the shotgun serial numbers.  What if Breuning and Carlisle took them from the evidence room?  Couple of cold pieces that had been hanging around a year or two.

You know, all I ever wanted was to measure up to my father.

I'm a homicide detective.  Where were you last night?

Richard Stensland.

Officer White.  How about Susan Lefferts?  You know her?

Where's the other guy?  Buzz.

No.

Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?

Whose shoe?

But she's moving away from the door.  Who was sitting at this table?

More or less.

So on active duty, Meeks didn't make an arrest from 1938 to '43.

Where are the police academy files?

You're twenty-two, aren't you, Ray?

I heard you like to shoot dogs.

Ray, we got the shotguns.

Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgeons, is the key to all relationships.

Dudley, we've been over this.

Yes, I do, sir.

There are loose ends out there, Dudley.  I --

Have you discussed this with anyone else, John?

I should've known.  What's the Chief throwing you?

Yeah, Exley.  What's the payoff?

Transfer me, suspend me.  Just leave me alone.

So what's the point?

I'm trying to figure what angle you're playing <u>this</u> time, but I sure as hell can't see one.

Jesus... Maybe White's not so dumb after all.

She is Lana Turner.

I get the idea.  You got a description?

I'll tell you what I told Officer White when he asked me about Susan's death.

It galls you that I know so much about you.  You don't have information to compete.

You're tougher than Bud thinks you are.

If I knew you were coming I'd have baked a cake.

On what evidence?

They're sitting in the dark, goofing on the Christmas tree.

No.  But I've got something going with Ad Vice.

You tight with the D.A., trash?

Jackie!  You got some good scoop for the Sidster?

He's dead.  I was just there. Somebody slit his throat.

No, Sergeant.  I checked twice.

Have we met before?

I'm pretty sure I can get you a part on the show... But tonight? Pretend it's an acting job, kid. Showbiz.

Gee.  The Great Jerk-Off Book Caper of 1953.

Someone else?

It's actually DH-1 Digitech Pinpoint scanning with a frequency modulator.

Tired of chasing squirrels around the park?

I'm doing a transfer now.

It is?

Tell us about Rachel Banks.

You've heard of the National Security Agency?

Okay.

I don't know what that means.

Why are they after <u>me</u>?

Wait. What do I do?

I'll pay you.

I mean did you call anyone.

Jesus!

The NSA's been in bed with the entire tele-communications industry since the 40's. They've infected everything: Banks, computers, phones, mail, name it.  The more technology we buy into, the easier it is keeping tabs on us. It's a brave new world.  At least it better be.

Meade has 18 underground acres of computers. They scan <u>every</u> phonecall for target words like "bomb" or "President". We red-flag phone numbers or voice prints...whatever we wanted. When the computers found something, it was bounced to comparative analysis.

The NSA killed him.

Empty 'em 'till they're almost flat. And turn your head. There might be some debris flying your way.

If they couldn't do that, they'd shut down the whole system, all the relays.

Feeling lucky?

I yanked this off your RV. It's a Global Positioning Tracker.

Oh, God, I <u>knew</u> it was stupid, I <u>knew</u> we'd get caught. But the Gameboy was just <u>sitting</u> there. Right on top of the bag. Yes. Yes. We took the GameBoy out of the bag, but with every intention of putting it back.

Do you see anything you like?

You'd like to buy your wife some lingerie as a Christmas gift.

How 'bout Christian Dior?

I'll be right back.

For that matter, I think you will too.

That's my point.

Your stuff?

Are you invoking attorney/client privilege.

I'm just trying to determine if Mr. Zavitz was involved in something more than a simple bus accident.

Why so edgy, Mr. Dean?

We won't suspend the civil rights of the good people.

Who did you work with to get the--

Have you been working with Rachel?

You told me you weren't seeing her at <u>all</u>.

Oh, please--

I know, but listen--

It wasn't me.

Stacy, somebody's trying to kill me. Now goddamit--

The lingerie.

It's really over?

Who?

That ain't me.

You don't know who the fuck--

Actually, that's not true.

Brill?

Other than Brill.

What makes you think it's you?

You're a moron, you know that?

God knows I would, sir, but I have a previous engagement this evening.

Diane, maybe you didn't hear Mr. Silverberg. They've got models that'll try on the garments.  Thank you, sir.

Gentlemen--

Because they've been paid off by Bellmoth.

She doesn't want to talk to you.

Excuse me, have any of you seen an eight year old boy, good looking, about yea-big.

You're learning a cruel lesson.

Some of 'em.

It's okay to use the phone.

Why don't you give 'em a call.

They didn't take the jewelry. They took the computers. They took the big-screen TV, they took my blender.

What?

He's heard that it's escalated.

They're framing me.

Jerry--

I won't <u>make</u> it to the police. They won't let me get there. You go.

Bobby? Piece of advice?

Yeah?

It's been a few years.

What does that have to do with you?

Then what's your goddam opinion?

There are planes falling out of the sky, buildings blowing up. <i>American</i> buildings. <i>Americans</i> getting bombs in the mail. What are we gonna do!?

What about the tapes?

He's arrogant and threatening. Voice stress points suggest he's worrying.

It was in his bag. Now it's not.

We found two sets of latent prints in the rubble of Brill's studio. One was Dean's. The other, we believe, belongs to Brill.

We think it was on Brill. If it was, it's destroyed now.

Not yet. He's near "M" and 34th. I've got an ELSUR unit on the scene now. A residential building. Twelve units.

Yes?

This guy's carrying the <u>flag</u> for the damn terrorism bill. You think this is the best time to piss him off?

Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?

Then let's assume I don't.

Now is that clear?

Isn't Zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms?

You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.

That insults them.

We took several photographs, there's no need.

There's really no need.  This is just a scrapbook.  I should feel obliged.  Thank you.

They're so untidy.  I'm just trying to rearrange them.

- there is the Harmattan, a red wind. Which Mariners called the sea of darkness.  Red sand from this wind has flown as far as the south coast of England, producing showers so dense they were mistaken for blood. Almasy checks to see if Katharine is still awake.

Will you please come in?

You sew very badly.

Say you're sick.

Arabic?

Ouch!  See - you're always beating me..!

This - what's it called? - this place, I love it - this is mine!  I'm asking the King permission to call it the Almasy Bosphorous.

Dance with me.

Katharine!  Oh dear God, Katharine - what are you doing here?

Why did he bring you?

Why did you hate me?

Shall we be all right?

A broken car?

I think the desert is, it's - for a woman - it's very tough, I wonder if it's not too much for her.

It's Geoffrey under this.

Oops!  Mustn't say International. Dirty word.  Filthy word.  His Majesty! Die Führer!  Il Duce.

Good morning!

What did you do?

And I'm telling you there's nothing there to explore.

Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government.  They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of.

Why do they care about our maps?

Look, either shut up, or go home.

We didn't care about countries. Did we?  Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans.  None of that mattered, did it?  It was something finer than that.

I have to teach myself not to read too much into everything.  Comes of too long having to read so much into hardly anything at all.

May God make safety your companion.

Fritz?  What are you talking about? Who's Fritz?

Your leg will be fine.  A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces.

No, I'll get you some tea. Wait till you're in Naples.  You'll find a girl there.

Would it? She kisses him, very softly, on the lips.

David Caravaggio.

Petty thief, six months imprisonment Kingston Penitentiary, 1937.

Why is there so much nose?  I can't hear myself think!  Look - give me something.  So we can all get out of this room.  A name.  A code.  It's too hot.

Well, you must know.  You were brought up Libya, yes?

Or was it Toronto?

What do you want?

Buon' giorno.

Hello.

Thief, I think, is more accurate.

Is it you?  If I said Moose I look different, fuck, why shouldn't you?

Irving Berlin.

So, I come across the Hospital Convoy  I was looking for this stuff, and some nurse, Mary, Hana's friend, tells me about you and Hana, hiding in a monastery, in purdah, whatever it is - retreat -  how you'd come in from the Desert and you were burned and you didn't know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession -  - a copy of Herodotus - and it was full of letters and cuttings, and then I knew it must be you.

You were the only man who knew the desert well enough, the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing.

Right.

Marvelous plane.  Did you look?

What was all the banging?  Were you fighting rats or the entire German army?

Oh - I've found plums.  We have plums in the orchard.  We have an orchard! She has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth.

He needn't disturb you.

That's a different dress.

I'll probably marry him.

I liked it better when there were just the two of us.

With his Sergeant.  A Mr. Hardy.

Why don't you go?  You should sleep.

There's meant to be lace in the next village - the boys are taking me.

I'm not sewing anything else for you!

Why would anyone do this?

But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?

I know - here I am always a brown man, there you would be always a white woman.

It's what I've learned.

I thought that was for when we were very very old?

Hey!  Hey!  Stop!  Hey!

Mrs. Clifton, you'll have to forgive us.  We're not accustomed to the company of women.

I'm afraid we're not having much luck obtaining funds for the expedition.

Darling, Peter says I could stay

You should sit down, darling.  She's quite all right.  Are you pregnant?

Am I being interrogated?  You should be trying to trick me.  Ask me about Tottenham Hotspur.  Or Buckingham Palace. About Marmite - I was addicted.  Or make me speak German, which I can, by the way.

No.

Or my wife's.

They've never caught him before, what makes you think they'll catch him now?

It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.

I've been following this guy for years. I'm your best shot.

You don't call, you don't write.

How close?

Gin? Where the hell are you?

In the middle? You've got the Mask, why don't we have him?

Listen to me. Whatever you're doing, stop. Pull out.

Why are we speaking Chinese?

A billion people speak Chinese. Don't be too impressed with yourself. As for that scroll, I can resell it for double. In 30 minutes.

How about if I try humility.

I'm sorry about the scroll, but sometimes you have to lose to win.

I don't care about the damned car. My luggage's been stolen.

I've got something...

You're shaking. Are you nervous?

The Empress Death Mask.

Besides, if I lacked certain ethical scruples about the ownership of property--which I do not--I wouldn't need a partner, much less a callow girl. I'd do it myself.

You want me to pick up a painting?

Fine. What do I do?

It's a fake.

What the hell do I do now?

What the hell was that?

That's entrapment.

Nothing? You don't even lock the door?

And good morning.

I know it well.

Only a week?

I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.

On what? Another job?

So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.

Why don't we take oxygen?

Let's do it again.

I didn't mean to get personal.

I trust it's your size.

You were afraid of heights?

How in the devil did you do the Rembrandt then?

Popup, on floorboards. And--

Now's when you tell me who you really are.

What?

If you want a partner, I think you should recalculate the split.

Come on, what can you do with six billion you can't do with four?

Insidious thing, wondering if your partner...has another partner.

Idle hands, the devil's workshop.

Do you know what you've done!? Do you know?

The eight billion. From them to us.

Got it.

You can't be serious.

There's always a surprise.

Done.  And I assume you have the magic CD- ROM?

You have something in mind?

But would you--would you--

That's because you grew up rich.

Come on.

I cannot get rid of you.

Gin, really.

So patience, Thibeau, patience. Trust me.

Doesn't look like much. How come those Commos want it so bad?

You'll just have to have faith.

Thirty-five next generation microchips. Copper, not silicon. Value: one million each.

See you.

Where've you been?

His dry cleaners.  You want him?

What the hell is this doing here?

How does someone get meningitis?

I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe?

Thank you.  I think so too.  That's why I'm being such a stickler on this house price thing.  I don't mean to be a pain in PG&E's backside, especially after all they've done for Hinkley, but I look around here and I think, if they want this place, they're gonna have to pay for it.  And I don't just mean pay for the house; I'd like them to pay me for the trouble of starting over.

Are you kidding?  With how our lives are, if I start subdividing files, I'll be sunk.  I just kept all PG&E correspondence in one place.

What's chromium?

You wouldn't happen to have a little time right now, would you, Donna?

You never called me back.  I left messages.

Yeah?

Out to lunch with the girls.

Mr. Masry, Mario gets lost going to the bathroom.  They'll be driving around the valley for hours.

Then I don't get anything either.

Bullshit.

How many families we talking about here?

You think there's more?

Erin -- lemme tell you something.  If I'da put three researchers on this, I wouldn't expect them to dig up all the information you got here.  This is some damn good work.

Hey.  I like working with you.

Jesus.  They look like the Secret Service.

He said he'd be at the gas station at six.

I'll see what I can do.

Because <u>that's how people treat each other</u>!

Bullshit.  You'd drag me off my deathbed if it suited you.

You're emotional.  You're erratic.  You say any God damn thing that comes into your head.  And I'm not saying that's bad.  That can be great; that can be a lot of fun --

Okay, now you're making this personal, and it isn't --

Don't give me that.  You've gotten plenty. You've been well-paid; you've gotten lots of perks ...

Why not?

I don't know what to say.

Careful you don't spit from here; you could kill someone.

Yeah.  Yours is nicer.

Here what comes?

Who's the judge?

And you were told to destroy those?

Erin.  Cool.  What can I do for you, Erin?

Yes.  There's straight-up chromium -- does all kinds of good things for the body. There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium, which, depending on the amounts, can be very harmful.

So that stuff -- it kills people.

Put your napkins in your laps and eat up.

Yeah.  A real moron.

You've been reading for hours.

I never forget, honey.  I try, real hard. It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, I end up falling short.

She's one of the sick people?

Whose number do you need?

I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?

Annabelle Daniels.

You want my number?

Sure.  That's one of my numbers.  It's how many months old my little girl is.

I had a good neighbor, George.  She was 60 and Mexican and she watched my kids for free.  Something tells me you're not gonna be able to measure up to that.

I hope that's not supposed to impress me.

Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids?

This isn't gonna get you laid, you know.

What are you doing here?

Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh? They're scarred for life.  They're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now.

What's going on?  What are you doing?

About this.

It's a pair of earrings.  I saw 'em in the mall one day, and I thought, damn, those would look good on those beautiful earlobes. So I bought 'em.  And I said to myself, next time Erin says something nice, does something nice, I'll surprise her with 'em.  Know how long ago that was?  Six months.  In six months, you haven't said one nice thing to me.  That's a long time.

You already packed up your stuff?

They said that'd be tomorrow.  They just wanna keep an eye on me another night.

Someone stole my stuff.

-- toothbrush, toothpaste, and a pair of hose.  Here.

What am I supposed to do, check in every two seconds?

There's something else, too.

Hi, sweetie.  Were you a good girl?  Where are Matt and Katie?

It'll be fine, yeah.

Dr. Paulsen?

Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich.  I was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about -- I guess they call it epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it.

Who's Baxter?

Well, look, there isn't a ton of information here, but from what there is, I'd say that these two people here -- what are their names?  Shanna and Ashley?

... and when I realized our area's just as bad as Hinkley, I thought maybe my neighbors are all sick too.  So I went and asked.

I gotta say, Erin -- first time I saw you, I did not peg you as the kind to go off and conduct her own epidemiological study.

Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing.  The Millennium Falcon definitely went into lightspeed. It's probably on the other side of the galaxy by now.

Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader.

Barks a doleful farewell.

I'm looking for a great warrior.

Look, it smells good.  I'm sure it's delicious   But I don't know why we can't see Yoda now.

Our destruction?  Who?

He's not a Jedi, he's just a boy. Obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ...

Captain Solo.  What's the situation?

I don't know, Artoo.  Sir, might I inquire what's going on?

Transport XJ. get out of here. Go!

You, too, golden rod.

It sounds like it's trying to get in.

I can see the edge of the asteroid field, sir.

Not you?

Spare me please!  Don't tell me about the Rebellion again.  I've had it with your noble mission. All you let yourself think about is the Rebellion.  The result is you're as cold as this planet.

Hey!  Someone's still in here.

Why, Princess, this is so sudden.

You don't look angry.

Sorry, Captain, being held by you isn't enough to get me excited.

There's nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized.

I do not!

Couldn't be, I checked the transfer circuits, just like you said!  I tell you this time it's not my fault.  I'm sure I checked it.

I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.

What'd you have in mind for your next move?

Not bad, hot shot, not bad.  Then what?

That depends.  Where are we?

Lando's not a system, he's a man. A gambler, con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ...  ... your kind of guy.  The system is called Bespin.  It's a ways from here, but reachable.

A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back.

You look silly.

I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right.

He found him in a junk pile ...

Why you slimy, double-crossing no-good swindler ... am I glad to see you.

That ship saved my life a few times.  It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy.  What's wrong with her?

Don't shoot!  I've done what I can for you.  I'm sorry it's not better, but I've got my own problems.  I've already stuck my neck out further than I should ...

No.

That wasn't the bargain.  You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in--

I must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled.  Truly you belong here with us among the clouds.

What'd you say?

The deflector shields are gone.

Closer?!

Leia ... What would you think if I went away for a while?

That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?

Leia!

Master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different.

Okay.  I'll give it a try.

I can't. It's too big.

I don't believe it.

Price?  What do you mean?

Your future lies with us, Skywalker. Now you will embrace the dark side. Obi-wan knew this to be true.

All too easy.  Perhaps you are not as strong as The Emperor thought.

Seventeen ships destroyed, we don't know how many got away.

Excuse me.  I didn't mean to disturb....  What am I saying?

So am I.  And I mean you no harm.

Do you have a name?

But he isn't us.  He's your own kind.

Primitive?

He doesn't look like his picture.  I bet he's fake.

Ooww!

I tried...

I thought he was, but he came back.

I need a favor.

See you in hell, Snake.

No. The right skid's broken. If I try to set it down she'll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off.  Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.

That's the deal.

She's in the green.

Plissken - this is Malloy. Do you have the prototype?

Got a smoke?

Getting ready to invade.

Location.

I said pull over.

Not yet.

Later.

Aw, come on, Snake.

I don't know about this thing.

You ain't doin' so good, Snake. You need help.  You should talk to Hershe. She hates Cuervo. They used to be partners, but they split up.

Hi, Snake. It's so great to meet you. My name's Taslima. I'm a fan of yours.

No screamin' shit.

Why don't you get out of L.A.? Take a boat to China, take an airplane to Brazil?  Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do you stay?

Where's the anti-toxin...?

There is one thing left to do... Excalibur... And you must do it, Perceval. Leave my wounds, I command you.

I am Sir Lancelot of the Lake, from across the sea. I am the best knight in the whole of Christiandom, and I look for the king who is worthy of my sword's service.

Not a boast, sir, but a curse.  Never have I met my match in joust or duel.

Yield. I have the advantage.

Fight me from your horse or on foot, but fight me. Your avoidance mocks me.

Sir, your rage has unbalanced you. It seems you would fight to the death against a knight who is not your enemy, for a length of road you can ride around.

But your life and lands are far from here.

Perceval, you have returned!

I want to thank you.

Who will it be? Put your mind to it, then.

So you were stealing their honey. They should have killed you.

--Stories... You brought me back. Your love brought me back. Back to where you are now, in the land of dreams...

Who is, then?

Who?!

To me? But why?

Why didn't he kill us?

It is.

You are truly magnificent!

Merlin, the powers of Summoning, the true Name of the charms of Doing and Undoing. Show me!

I should butcher all and every one of them. Merlin, what is this wagging of tongues?

I have walked my way since the beginning of time. Sometimes I give, sometimes I take. It is mine to know which, and when.

Now you must pay me.

Maybe not even that, Uther. I thought once that you were the one to unite the land under one sword. But it'll take another, a greater king...

It must be alright. He's still running around digging up tombs. Besides, he's had experience.

Let's see whose around. In the meantime I'll call you as soon as I know.

Quite frankly, we don't know much about it except that it's starts with some conflict or guilt that eventually leads to the patient's delusion that his body's been invaded by an alien intellegence; a spirit if you will.

I'm sorry.

Hi

Here.

Hello? Yes this is Mrs. MacNeil. Operator you have got to be kidding I have been on this line for twenty minutes.  Jesus Christ, can you believe this, he doesn't even call his daughter on her birthday for christ sake.

What the hell do you mean going out and leaving Regan by her self! What are you kidding her window's wide open...

Didn't who tell me?

Strange...strange...so baffling. The deceased comes to visit, stays only twenty minutes, and leaves all alone a very sick girl. And speaking plainly Mrs. MacNeil, as you say, it's not likely he would fall from a window. Besides that, a fall wouldn't do to his neck what we found except maybe a chance in a thousand. My hunch? My opinion? I believe he was killed by a very powerful man: point one. And the fracturing of the skull - point two - plus the various things I have mentioned, would make it very probable - probable, not certain - that the deceased was killed and then pushed from your daughter's window. But no-one was here except your daughter. So how could this be? It could be one way: if someone came calling between the time Miss Spencer left and the time you returned. The servants, they have visitors?

Would you like some more coffee?

I lied. It's for me. The spelling is on the back, Kinderman. You know that film you made called Angel? Isaw that six times.

Very sorry, but you see, no rats!

Excuse me Miss?

A man to see you.

Excuse me Madame? Will there be anything else?

Morning.

Is it coming out Willie?

She used those words?

Are you planning to be home soon? LA, I mean.

Yes I could, I could see her as a psychiatrist...

There are no experts. You probably know as much about possession than most priests. Look your daughter doesn't say she's a demon, she says she's the devil himself and if you've seen as many psychotics as I have, you'd know it's like saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte. You ask me what I think is best for your daughter. Six months, under observation in the best hospital you can find.

Wanna drink.

She...killed Burke Dennings.

Oh look at that.

Where?

You really don't want me to play huh?

Captain who?

It's not even a good picture. Looks to mature.

Well thank you very much but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday?

Yeah I like him. Don't you like him? Hey what's going on? What is this?

Oh Regan I love your daddy. I'll always love your daddy. Burke just comes around here a lot because he's lonely, don't got nothin' to do.

Well your thinking's not so good.

People get tired.

What are you doing here?

I don't want it.

She doesn't remeber a thing.

Lieutenant?

Withering Heights.

Hello Regan. I'm a friend of your mother, I'd like to help you.

I'm affraid you might hurt yourself Regan.

I see. Well then let's introduce ourselves, I'm Damien Karras.

You'd like that?

But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?

You and Regan?

Save your servant

Can you give her something?

Look, Father this is hard for you- please. But for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist; you'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't. I mean this kind of sickness. You'd know that.

Ah, doctor's ethics. If you knew you wouldn't tell, huh?

I get passes to the best shows in town. Mrs. K though, she gets tired and never likes to go.

Answer the question, Father Paranoia.

Who?

Frankie.

What's this?

Just the same.

Honey ...

What's our friend's problem?

What's wrong with them?

You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?

Jack.

Count it.

Listen ... why don't you come out to the house this weekend.  Say hello to the kids. They've grown.

You're their uncle.

By the way, we gotta go see Ma tomorrow.

The hell you don't.

That's what we agreed.

What are you, crazy?

You're getting cold feet about this.

What's the matter?

Awe inspiring.

You hit me.

I just wish she'd get here, that's all.

Sounds like a booking agent looking to book an easy fee.

Better take care of your fingers, little brother. Buy yourself a case of arthritis and you won't be able to play 'Chopsticks.'

I thought we had separate rooms.

So you're gonna leave it on. Every night.  For a week.

Accommodate?  I don't think I know what you mean.

Thank you, thank you.  You know, Susie and Jack and I only just arrived here yesterday, but already the people here at the King Corporation's Moorish Manor have made us feel, well, a part of the family. And it's their hope that, before you leave, everyone of you will feel a part of that family also.  So, if during-the next few days, we should happen to pass one another in the hallway or in the lobby or wherever ... don't be a stranger. Stop.  Say hello.  Introduce yourself.  Because here, there are no strangers, only friends. And family.  Right, Jack?

What's the matter with you?

They stopped serving two hours ago.

Yeah, well, she's our girl now.  I think we better keep an eye on her.  There's trouble there.  Hey, listen to this.  Ethel and Bert Lane. Married seventy-five years.  You believe that?

He had to come quickly.  It was a big leak.

What're you doing down here?

Couple years.

Yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice. He loved that about you.

It was like you'd passed some test, you know?

What?

What do you mean?

Be reasonable, Jack.

Cancel, Frank.

Nothing. We get nothing.

What's happening to you, Frank?  You been kissing ass so long you're starting to like it?  You let that guy turn us into clowns tonight.  We were always small time, but we were never clowns, Frank. What's happened to your dignity?

You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.

I mean, you can play.  You're okay.

Yeah.  Larry Shelton.  Blackie.  Couple others. Donna said even Lloyd called the other day. Nothing like a little absence to make the heart grow fonder, huh?

So what'd you think?

The audience was a little off tonight.

I guess you're,right.  Well, what do you say we get a little midnight snack? Theo's should still be open.

A cab?  Ma, come on.  My car's just a half block down.  You wait here.

And if she asks what it's about, don't tell her. She's opposed to my career.

Just like that, huh?  You're not even gonna give me a chance?

Hey, it's legit.  Strictly dinner and dance.

Christ, look at her. You'd think if she was gonna wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense to come in the back.  Good evening, Miss Diamond.  You're late.

I wear a seven.

Shoes?

They're tight.

Uh, well ... we flipped a coin.

Virgins?

Hey, we're connected.

Wow. You ever see her again?

Hey, will you look at that?

What's with you two?

What's with you guys?

I guess I ... If I jumped to...

How about you?  Got a Bar Mitzvah this weekend?

I can't sing it anymore.

I'm gonna throw up, Frank.  I mean it. Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?

Good morning, gentlemen.  I'm Mr. Daniels, the manager.  I believe I've spoken to one of you on the phone.

How come?

Thanks.

Don't worry about it.

Barker.  Jock Barker?

No.

You miss him, don't you?

Mmm.  Like kissing a rose.  Well, au revoir.

You kidding?  We must've killed three pots in there.  Anyway, I gotta get home.  Rest the pipes.

Forget it.

If you want, I got a pack in the room.

How do you do it? Every night?

I can keep the beat.

What's the matter?

Nina?

Friend.

They'd been out dancing all night and he took her to the train station -- she lived over in Brookhaven.  Usually held ride with her, but this time he didn't.  Anyway, he starts walking home, only as he's walking he starts getting nervous.

He had a mind that escalated things.

So ... ?

What kind?

Vegetables.

Tell egghead I said hi.  If you see him.

Ah, you know. Howsa pooch?

Guess they're up.

In the old days, every man had a shaving mug that he kept at the barber shop.  Then, whenever he wanted a shave, held go down to the barber shop and there would be his mug, waiting for him.

My days are not the old days, genius.

Oh?

Well, let's get your first prom under the belt, okay?

Big piece or little?

None?

You shouldn't have brought me here ... it's dangerous.

Go on, Adam ...  I'm not asking you for anything -- I was never even going to tell you. But hell, I never thought I'd see you again, either.

Why would he need more?

So?

Do you know what it is to be in a coma?  It fucks up everything -- including your memory! I can't even tell you why Dobbs jumped me yesterday!

That's not the worst part.

I'm late for surgery.

We were back in high school. You wanted to join the sky diving team, but I wouldn't let you.

Is someone there?

I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's already dead.

You can't go.  You can't be anywhere near that place.

How's Loomis?

We can send in a plant -- try to get Pollux to spill the location.

Which ear was it?

You missed the last three, including her birthday.  Your wife's gripe sheet.

Jon, I'm getting a little annoyed by your obsessive need to spoil my fun.

Stay away from my family!

Give up, Castor.  People are going to find out.

You'll what?

You better be nice, Castor. You could get mighty lonely now that Pollux is gone.

Archer cut him a deal for turning state's evidence. He's free.

Get a higher arc on the ball, Jamie.  And for Chrissake, square your shoulders to the basket.

What are you -- stupid?

You merciless bastard!

Don't worry, nobody knows I'm inside.  Check it out.  Remember that fat fuck agent who roughed us up in Thailand?  He's being treated for bone cancer at the V.A.  Thanks to the miracle of NSA grid-technology ...  -- Ooops!  His radiation does just quadrupled.

All of them do.  We'll kill twelve birds with one bomb.  And we'll be rich.

You'll need to recultivate that virus.

Look at you, Jon -- at your age -- an American hero!  I'd buy you a drink but I know you'd just turn me down.

What's that?

You'd have to start immediately.

I just thought that -- under the circumstances -- you might want to postpone the meeting with the station chiefs.

As much as ever.  Nothing.

Jon -- I don't have time to play games.  There're leftovers in the fridge.

Hurry up -- the salad's getting warm and the pasta's getting cold.

You're wearing your suit --

I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.

Remember this from our junior prom?  Boy, were you ever mad for Madonna.

You too?  This holiday's about giving, Adelle.  And I'm giving everything I've got to this deal, so in a way, I'm more Christmassy than anyone...  Lifesaver?

Her assistant?

Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college.  I almost married her...

Almost married.  And almost a junior broker at E.F. Hutton...

God, no.  I thought about it for practically the entire flight...

I'll leave from the office tomorrow afternoon.  Call the group.  Schedule an emergency strategy session for noon.

You're right, Jack.  Sorry... Jack approaches Alan.

You have kids, Jack?

We did one point seven million in total revenue...

Jack, are you okay?

Fightings a part of it, Annie.  You know that, right?

This isnt my real life. Its just a glimpse...

They did a pretty good job.

You promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains?

This is day care.  Its where babies go when their parents are at work.

Try not to be late because kids dont like to be the last one picked up.

Very nice. What is it?

What am I saying?  You dont need to hear that...  All I meant was a lot of people have a hard time dealing with all the forced reverie, thats all.  Is that you?

Trouble at work?

She is relentless.

Oh yeah...  What is it about you?

Howd you know my name?

Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right?  Youre doing well...

You never really talked to me.  I wanted to talk to you, man...

Got a minute, Jack?

So you're telling me, you've got a gun to your head and you don't think for one second, what if this, what if that, maybe I shouldn't do this, I shoulda done that.

Look, I'm not saying you'd be able to do it without some hard work...

Everyone else in that store is a statue, they see their lives passing in front of their eyes, but not you.  Youre making a business deal...

Its a glimpse, Jacko.

As long as it takes to figure it out.  Which, in your case, could be considerable.

...06...14...18...48...right there.  Four numbers...that's two hundred and thirty eight dollar...  Merry Christmas and shit...

Finger food...?

Are we finally being honest?

Mr. Mintz?  I dont think so...buildings closed pal.  Youll have to come back tomorrow.

Thats the kind of thing you can really build on...

Here we are, mag wheels...  Hey Jack, are you sure youre okay?

Why dont you let me take this one, Kenny?

Sorry, pal.  Entrance is for residents and guests only...

Every one of these songs will remind you of me in a slightly different way...

I can't seem to let go of you...

What kind of man does that!?

You look forward to this party all year.  Whats with you today?

Why not?

This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...

How can you do that?

I mean...wow...off the charts great.

Look, Im sorry.  Im sorry I was such a saint before and Im such a prick now.  Maybe Im just not the same guy I was when we got married...

You mean this chocolate cake?

Thank you...

Jack.

You really are incredible...

You actually forgot our anniversary.

Now Im worried...just say it.  Whatever it is well deal with it.

My office is a dump, I answer my own phone...and youve seen my pay check.

You know champagne makes me do crazy things.

My god, all this time...I never stopped loving you...

I could stay here forever...

I cant believe you want to move back into the city.  I thought the reason we left was because we didnt want to raise the kids here?

I promise, Jack...

Whats going on?

To Paris. Paris, France.

So youre not at a non- profit firm?

Dont get on that plane!

I need you, tiger..

Hey Peter, lemme ask you a question.  An old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on Christmas Eve...

For one thing, you like expensive things.

Did you really mean what you said about Tuscany?

I found it!

You don't know what it's like out there.  Walking around like some kind of circus freak.  People staring, whispering --

I mean...

I don't think She's real big on hate.

I can't take this.

What about his first born?

Can't do it.  I cannot do it.

Isn't that <u>your</u> speech?

This is your dream, Reed.  You should be the one up there.

I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.

He's smart, powerful, successful --

No more cracks about how I look.

I'll be watching over you.

Ben, come in.

He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."

<u>Where is Reed</u>?

Oh, you dawg you.  Better not be my nurse!

We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...

What?  No.  I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.

He's right.  These costumes are... missing something.  I can't put my finger on it --

That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber.  It's muscle, tendon.  I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --

I though we went over this.

Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl...the Invisible Girl.

Ben's still out there --

Come on, Ben, come on...

Didn't go as <u>planned</u>?  It was a <u>catastrophe</u>.  You ruined the lives of four people --

As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --

Feeling better?

Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them.

I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger.  Can you remember the exact emotions when --

I mean, <u>you</u> broke up with <u>me</u>, right?

And you sure you can control this thing?  Last time didn't work out so well.

Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --

Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...

Victor, I'm sorry I --

I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --

Grant's uniquely qualified for this mission. He's a Communications Expert and was a Frogman during the War. Besides, he brought Benes into this country, and the fewer people who know about him, the better. At any rate, you'll find Grant invaluable, should anything go wrong once you're under way.  Okay, Don.

Where do we stand?

Okay to proceed.

But we have no choice! We've got, to take them out!

I know that. But what's the maximum?

Benes... What the devil happened?

I can't even put a Band-Aid on my finger.

Right, sir.

There'll be a team of Surgeons standing by. We're prepared to remove you immediately, should anything go wrong. In any event, you must be out within sixty minutes. After that, you'll be in danger of attack.

[LINE OF DIALOGUE CUT OFF]

Listen...the Heart.

Cora, is something wrong with the laser?

I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am.

Well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise.

That's the trouble. I am. Being shrunk...

That could be quite a lethal weapon... It could kill, not cure.

I understand you've been Dr. Duval's Assistant for quite some time... He must've snatched you out of the cradle.

Open it! Open it before they get here!

You're not the first, but he's much too innocent, much too involved with his work, to realize what's going on around him.

What do you mean?

The Soul? The finite mind cannot comprehend Infinity. And the Soul which comes from God is Infinite.

--and certain chemicals involving proteins --

Just a few cells away from a vast air chamber -- one of the countless Alvioli of the Lung -- and we can't get enough to fill a microscopic tank.

Doctor, we've just about had it.

Tell them to take us out.

Yes -- with all that pressure, and suction within --

All right now -- push the snorkel through as soon as I get inside.

Well, sir? Which is it? The wireless, or Benes' life?

Looks like the sea, at dawn.

Sabotage? I don't understand...

You have no right to blame Duval --

Skipper, you're picking up seaweed -- or whatever it is.

Looks like somebody declared war.

Looks like quite a way to go...

Sorry we had to get you up at this hour, Mr. Grant.

What'd you do that for?

Come on -- it's no use!

Yes, there is.

...What do you mean, you decided not to park here?

Ophhem ma fuchem gaphe!

...Is this a fucking joke?

...So maybe the best thing would be to take care of that, right here in Brainerd.

Ya find the work interesting, do ya?

We stop at Pancakes Hause.

...Look at that. Twin Cities.  IDS Building, the big glass one.  Tallest skyscraper in the Midwest.  After the Sears, uh, Chicago...  You never been to Minneapolis?

Shut the fuck up or I'll throw you back in the trunk, you know.

One of us pays the other for half.

Oh, no, it's real sound. It's all worked out.

We need more -

DON'T EVER INTERRUPT ME, JERRY! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!

Blood has been shed. We've incurred risks, Jerry. I'm coming into town tomorrow. Have the money ready.

Yah, I got the money, but, uh -

Yah, okay, but, uh -

I sat right here and said I didn't want no TruCoat!

You're sittin' here, you're talkin' in circles! You're talkin' like we didn't go over this already!

Well, he never done this before, but seein' as it's special circumstances and all, he says I can knock one hunnert off that TruCoat.

Ah, well, we haven't had to run around like you. When're you due?

Yah.

Well, Ecklund & Swedlin's, that's closer ta Moose Lake, so I made that assumption.

So, ya know, he's drinkin', so I don't think a whole great deal of it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the homicides out here and she thought I should call it in, so I called it in. End a story.

Just a general way.

Oh sure. They say she's gonna turn cold tomorrow.

I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.

He was a little older. Looked like the Marlboro man.

You know what a disparity is?

Jerry - we thought you were bringin' us an investment.

...How ya doin' there, Scotty?

It's okay, Scotty. They're not gonna want to hurt her any.  These men, they just want money, see.

Well, you can help me. My name's Marge Gunderson -

So how do you - have you done any kind of inventory recently?

Yah, real good. How you doin'?

Yah, well, they exist all right.

Well, but see, I don't have 'em in front a me - why don't I just fax you over a copy -

Yah, no problem, I'll just fax that over to ya, then.

Yah!

Yah.

...Dad?

Yah, Shep Proudfoot said -

Shep said 8:30.

Yah, you bet. It's in the lot there. Brand-new burnt umber Ciera.

Stan Grossman called.

Yah, well, it's a chunk, but -

Well, a course they're gonna say that! But where's my protection? They got Jean here! I give these sons a bitches a million dollars, where's my guarantee they're gonna let her go.

Say, Shep, how ya doin' there?

Say, ya know those two fellas ya put me in touch with, up there in Fargo?

Hiya, Lou.

Yah, thanks a bunch. So what's the deal, now? Gary says triple homicide?

Geez, you okay, Margie?

So I got the state lookin' for a Ciera with a tag startin' DLR.  They don't got no match yet.

...I'll fix ya some eggs.

Oh, yah, a long time ago.

Yah, sorry, so I was married to Linda Cooksey - ya remember Linda?  She was a year behind us.

Well, I always liked you, Mike.

...I'm sorry... I shouldn't a done this... I thought we'd have a really terrific time, and now I've...

You were such a super lady...  and then I... I been so lonely...

Well, associating with criminals, if you're the one they talked to, that right there would be a violation of your parole and would end with you back in Stillwater.

No, I'm leavin' this mornin', back up to Brainerd.

Oh. Oh, my.

Oh, I'm almost back - I'm driving around Moose Lake.

Aw, hon, you're better'n them.

They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.

They announced it?

Hautman's blue-winged teal got the twenty-nine cent. People don't much use the three-cent.

Geez. Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. You call his home?

This is do-able.

What... ?

I need to know where Tyler is.  Can't you help me?

There's no one else here.

You are a moron.

Bob was a champion bodybuilder.  You know that chest expansion program you see on TV?  That was his idea.

No.  I found something new.

You are?!

This is Detective Stern with the arson unit.  We have some new information about the "incident" at your condo.

I'm in pain.

I'm on to you.  You're a faker.  You aren't dying.

And I saw you practicing this...

These are my groups.  I was here first.  I've been coming for a year.

I'll take the parasites.

Look, this is a bad time...

Picture yourself watching Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.

It's time for you to leave.

You feel nothing?

Well, that's a relief.  Thank you.

I think everything's okay here.

Uh ... nah.

That... sawing and hammering.

He's not here.

Is that what you're calling it?

What did you say... ?

What?

Tyler?

You were in here last Thursday night.

You're the one who did this to me. You're Mr. Durden, sir.  Tyler Durden.

If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.  Marla...the little scratch on the roof of your mouth that would heal if only you could stop tonguing it, but you can't.

I mean -- for a living.

You see, when you travel, everything is small, self-contained--

Well, uh... great.

What?

But a good strange.

The fight.

I know that.

"I am Joe's Lungs."  It's written in first person.  "Without me, Joe could not take in oxygen to feed his red blood cells."  There's a whole series -- "I am Joe's Prostate."

What are you reading?

Okay... Ghandi.

You?

Unbelievable, huh?

She needs an exorcist.  This isn't love.  This is sport-fucking.

Promise you won't.

You get rid of her.

I... I think I understand.  I think I get it...

We don't need him...

Yeah.  Where you headed?

What... ?

What are we doing?

Tyler...

I feel sick.

Where did you go, Psycho-Boy?

Why wasn't I told about "Project Mayhem?"

Why wasn't I involved from the beginning?  You and I started fight club together.

What do you want?  A statement of purpose... ?

This does not belong to us.  We are not the leaders.  We are not special.

Four in Milwaukee.

Why did you do that?

We're going to have to do something about Marla...

What about Marla?

You could be standing under 37 stories of steel and concrete with a 150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped to the support... oh, maybe it couldn't be...

The buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago.  Everything's proceeding exactly as planned.

I wouldn't be doing that.  Unless you know which wires, in what order...

Bob was a grown man.  In any great struggle, there will be casualties. Wouldn't that be implicit in the name?  Project "Mayhem."

Tyler...

This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.

Please...

Why can't I get rid of you?  Why can't I just wish you away?

From now on, we'll share Marla. We've been spending too much time apart...

If I leave, you will be right back where I found you...

Why do you want to do that? Why do you want to put that gun in your mouth?

Why are you going with this, Ikea- boy?

His name is Robert Paulson!

Who told you motherfuckers you could use my place?

Ain't that something?

Okay!  Okay, fuck it!  Use the basement!  Get off me!

Raymond K. Hessel. 1320 SE Benning, apartment A.  A small, cramped basement apartment.

Is this a picture of Mom and Dad?

Biology, mostly.

Yeah, how?

What list?

Officer Burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends.

The second one just dies.  A 16 year old kid.

Please, what else could it mean?

What about that?

No!  It can't be.

Remember the onramp?  There was a pregnant woman in a white delivery van.

Here we go.  The vehicle's a delivery van registered to Jorge and Isabella Cruz.  And Christ, there's almost a dozen domestic disturbance complaints on these two.

Then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect Eugene and Isabella for as long as we can.

What?

Are you Jorge Cruz?

You mean Alex Browning.

I didn't.  Until I was dispatched to clean up one of the Flight 180 survivors.

Turn around.  The cleaning woman said they're at the dentist's. 14th and Main.

Nora's not coming.  She refuses to leave her son.

Guys, let's not panic.  Isabella's safe.

Shouldn't we pull over?

Welcome back.  We did it.  For real.

For God's sake, leave him alone, Dad.

This trip better be worth it. What's the guy-girl ratio again?

Thanks, Dad.  I'll call you.

Damn, it really hurts, Mom.

You're all certifiable, you know that?  I can't believe I've been listening to this crap.  Come on, Tim, let's go outside.

It's only the end of June.

You went there? I've wanted to go there, but I thought it was off limits.

That's why I was there last night.

"It?"

He said Death has a design. Even before he said that I had been seeing patterns.

I don't understand... did you see Tod die? Did it happen again, like on the plane?

I can't go home. After Lewton's, they'll be after me.

Get out! Get out of the car!  Get out of the fuckin' car!

Alright, Browning, you fuckin' warlock... did you know about Ms. Lewton, or what?

And then the cabin banged and the left side exploded. The the whole plane... blew up. It was so real. Exactly how everything goes.

I believe that... Ms. Lewton's next.

Cuticle lacerations.

Hey, man, why'd you say that?!

So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now?

Knock it off!

I know what you're doing!  It's alright to be scared, Carter. You don't have to prove to us how big your balls are. Not now.

... and there's this guy with a black helmet and cape, right, and he's got this sword... except it's not a sword, it's light...

This clown almost blew mission security on the street.  I'm not jumping with him.

You wanna know why I stood up for this show?

This place is a trip.

What's this stuff on the rice?

Why would they send us to a deserted camp?

What's that?

Snoring.  Five, six guys. Mumbling... Vietnamese.  Somebody talking in his sleep.  A toilet flushing.

Can you handle the door gun?

Brewer!  You know what that thing's packing?

You really got a Masters Degree?

Are you okay?

I do?

Invulnerable.

I know.  I go with you.

Yes you can.

Why me?

Memo E-7 on top will cover the details.  An abandoned Vietnamese Army base in the North-central highlands may have a compound used as an internment camp.  As you can see the intelligence is soft.  These LANDSAT photos show huts... barracks.  It could be anything.

Typical...

... and then he, uh... took the other one.

How long have you been setting up?

How long before you're fully on line?

"Terminate with extreme prejudice."

Man, you are one scary-looking motherfucker!

Congressional Medal of Honor.

Let's do it.

You know, I think I... ordered some just the other day.

I like your nails.  Where did you get them done?

My parents were divorced.

...SO...anybody special in your life?

What?

...My mother calls every week. Like a recurring nightmare. "So, have you met anyone?"..."No mom".. "So what's going to happen?"... "I don't know Mom"... I only thank God I moved out.

Then why the hell do we watch all the time?

I can't tell you how distraught I was.  All night long.  What the hell happened?

<u>What</u>!

You were attacked.  My God.  Should I call a doctor!  Did you call the police...

I tell you something, Anne.  I really feel like I'm cursed.

... I don't get a friggin' phone call.  You stroll in here at noon.  I got... two people out sick.  Ya think I need this?  I Do Not Need This!

He's not a moron.

All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.

I don't know... He's a little disgusting... Although some women go for that.

You know, I can't believe I did it. You think it'll work out?

... Listen, so much has happened and I think it would be a good thing for both of us if we slowed things down a little.

Bullshit!  If you're going to hurt me, you hurt me now -- not some long... drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you don't have the balls!

What have you been doing here!  <u>Huh</u>! <u>I wanna know</u>!  <u>What have you been</u> <u>doing here</u>?!

Parry?

Yeah, I know the place.  It's one of those chic <u>yuppie</u> gathering holes.

Can I help you?

Can I ask that when you clean your hands you wipe the ink off the inside of the sink before it stains the stainless steel.

You know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... It would be nice if you acted like you understood.

Hello Lydia?

Huh-huh.

Free?

You know, Anne does other people too. Sort of a sideline... 

Okay... twenty dollars... When can you...

Could you help me-- what was the name of that girl who just came in...

Oh, Lydia!

Do you know what the Little People just told me?

I think you're a very nice... very nice psychotic man.  I really appreciate what you did for me.  It was a very brave and noble thing...

Thanks... You can keep the doll.

"Soveriegn princess of his captive heart what dire affliction has thou made me suffer, thus banished from thy presence with reproach, and fettered by thy rigorous command, not to appear again before thy beautiful face. Deign princess, to remember this thy faithful slave, who now endures such misery for love of thee"....

But I gave it to you!

I don't know. But I gave it to you...to help YOU...not him.

Of course there is, Jack. What do you think the Crusades were - a frat initiation? I don't think so...There has to be a Grail.

I don't need a job. I have a quest.

I'm self-centered, I'm weak - I don't have the will power of a <u>fly</u> on shit...

Listen, he just needs to sleep it off. Someone will take care of him.

It's such a great song.

Don't you think it's time to go now? Running around here during the day is one thing but at night we could be killed by a wide variety of people.

..Ha...Little fella? I mean the man talks to invisible people - he sees invisible horses - and he's naked in the middle of Central Park. I should be surprised? I'm not surprised. I'm fucking outta my mind to even be here!

Maybe, when we get the Grail...

Holdin' my penis...

In a bar called Hellfire.

...I feel so much for her...I feel like something awful is going to happen.

Beautiful night huh?

...I..uh..I get to read some of the books but mostly I..just calculate production costs from first edition hard cover publication to paperback. After paperback it's basically someone else's problem.

Well, it's enough for me.

Well, no wonder.  We just met, made love and broke up all in the space of thirty seconds and I can't even remember the first kiss which is the best part.

No, I...

My name is Shirley, but they call me Betty, and her name's Twinky.

You're not going to play it again.

How 'bout if I just cut off your damn water?

I can't help it, honey, the ball just keeps goin' cocky wobbly on me...

I did, didn' I, El?

You just going to sit there?

I know you're not.

I'm not going to get up an' leave you.  Now let's go over to El's an' have a good time.

I'll be gone two or three weeks.

Just one minute, you! Don't you ever talk to me like that!

I 'magine it's me then, id'n it?

You're depressed that I come along.

'Cause if it was me, I could just catch a Greyhound back.

Why can't I go out to your folks' house? Give me one good reason.

So how long am I supposed to sit an' twiddle my thumbs in this place?

Just finish eating.

It's all right. He don't mean anything by that.

Bobby...

How far are you going to?

We'll get off in Washington and hook another ride.

I saw a picture of it. Alaska is very clean. It appeared to look very white to me... Don't you think?

No substitutions.

I'm gonna give you our number, Donnie, just in case...  We're both professionals, if you didn't guess.

Tea.

Robert Eroica...

Oh.

It's not funny. He permanently sprained his neck, and since then it's been extremely difficult for him to tuck the violin.

He has ways of communicating, Robert. I can tell when he's expressing approval or disapproval, just from his eyes...

It's not that bad.

What questions?

Oh no... Why? What is it? The way I look?

I probably am, but I don't care. I mean, I wasn't that blessed to begin with, and when would I have had time to make any improvements...

I think he's got a terrific personality.

Look, can't you see that, what I'm talking about?

Where is she, anyway?

Bye, now.

Hello...

Swimming?

I mean, how could you not play anymore? That's so strange to me...

Serious, that's what's important to you?

No inner feeling.

Robert?

I could spend some time with you tomorrow morning, before Carl comes back, I mean, if you'd like to.

No, I can't...

That'll make you happy.

Four or five years.

I'm not aware of it. Like what?

I've walked across a stage a number of times, without exciting any particular response...

Come on, get moving, dammit!!

Oh, no. You're more than welcome.

No, you're not. Go ahead and take your time.

Oh no, it's been much more than that.

You know, just after I came back off tour with the Betenthaller Quartet, Dad, myself and Herbert had a summit conference about you...

Well...

Mass production is what does it.

Yeah, it could be adorable...

Pardon me?

Don't fuck wit' me! Don't fuck wit' me.  My lawyer's so good he'll have you workin in Alaska, so dress warn.

Please don't scream at me. I like you, but I don't like the way your attitude is.

For once in your life have some 	respect for me, don't even curse at me or nothin'.

What chu listening to rumors for? I'm not like dat.

Do you have a name?

Wussup?

You know somebody around here?

Whadja wanna see me about?

So you got a girl?

A play-ya.

Who gives!

Fa what?

Oh man, what we gotta leave ar' own neighborhood for?

I gotta go take a piss.

Now salsa, you know how to dance salsa?

You here to see somebody?

Yo, that's my girl.

My friend told me she lived around here.

How do I know you're not lying.

Probably.  One of the many.

No.

You live around here?

Never heard of him. Thanks anyway.

Hey, what are you doing?

What? What are you talking about?

For a gentleman who was just found holding a bag full of heroin...

Speaking of which, you're not going to print anything before my investigation is through, are you?

Jerry, you're simply going to have to trust me. I've got a foolproof way to get rid of this guy and now you're jeopardizing everything.

Really. The California Racquet Club?

No children?

Is she ever. I've got some stories....

I think Id rather have drugs.

Jesus.

The two surfer boys?

You gonna nail the chief?

Noooo. Free snort. That's it.

Are you all right, Doctor?

Oh my God!

I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.

Are you serious?

Damn... lost again. Sorry.

Read this, please.

He is lifting Stanwyk's two attaché cases.

I was already prepared to commit one murder. What makes you think I won't commit two?

I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk. Actually, my company is the sub- insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by Alan Stanwyk, who I believe is your son.

Velma. You and Velma are the parents of Alan Stanwyk, Beverly Hills, California, executive vice president of Boyd Aviation?

Ten days ago?

Forgive me now for seeming personal, but we understand that there is a lady friend he sees here in Provo.

I couldn't sit home and play the mournful widow anymore, and the police didn't need me, so I tried watching a Lakers game on TV, but the announcer talked to fast and I couldn't understand a lot of what was happening, so I figured if I came down here maybe you could explain the rules to me, and besides, I missed you.

Its okay. The cops did it.

Don't call me Fletch. Don't look at me. Lie back down. We'll talk.

That's Brazil.

It is nothing of a sexual nature I assure you.  One thousand, just to listen. I don't see how you could turn that down Mr...

I'm still here.

Wouldn't they normally be locked?

So it looks like a burglary attempt. You catch me. I get the gun, and shoot you.

It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent.

Cute young thing, too.

Of course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh?

Huh? No, not my wedding. Yours.

Alan's in Utah.

If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.

I really should change.

Have you gotten cuter since I last saw you?

Lunch...

Why'd you let me in?

Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?

What about his parents?

He told me he was dying of cancer. Not True. That ranch you thought you were paying for in Utah? Not true.

No. You can't. Look, I know you don't know me from Adam, but you've got to trust me.

Oh God, I hate things that start like that....

What is this....

I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow.

You can't do that.

Would you care for a drink while you're waiting? I can put it on the Underhill bill.

Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk?

Oh, that's right. She told me to meet her there. That's cabana six?

One.

Muchas gracias.

I was supposed to meet Mrs. Cavanaugh.

Tell the cops.

No, I want an answer, Is the story done?

'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.

Two...

Who?

Gummy and two cops...

He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story.

Thanks for the vote of confidence, Frank.

This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy. 

I was upset.

And, I'm sorry, who are you again?

Who's Frieda?

Yes?

My God, Mr. Fairlane, you look like the Fall of Saigon.

So you know about Johnny Crunch and myself.

Zuzu Petals!  Did she have it?

Did she tell you anything?

Damnit... you were right last night. Jonathan and I were into more than sex.  Along with Bobby Vomit, right after old Jack Grendel died, we took part in a scheme to rip off Grendel records... I didn't want you involved...

I'm not cynical.  Can I help it that life is a disease and everyone's a victim. So you're producing exclusively for Grendel Records now.  Hope you're taking Julian for a bundle.

Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure.

All your friends call you Jazz.

I do it for love.

Let's just declare war on the hellhole.  Before they make <u>Crocodile Dundee</u> three.

Quiet.  Tell me you tapped in the police computer and found out lots of good stuff about Art Mooney...

You going to be okay?

Why did you interrupt?  Maxwell seemed like he wanted to hire me.

A fucking C.D.  Wow, this case is closed.  So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?

I don't know, what was the case?

She's just a bundle of energy, a real treasure...

Ah, an obvious choice.

Hello, Ford...

Aha, just what I suspected!

What an interface!

Got those Vomit invites here...

A simple 'please' would suffice...

Hello?

You okay?

Uh... wha?  You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?

Yeah, it's weird.  Bobby and Johnny were such good friends...

Oh how sweet, your friend's got his own star.

Fairlane, you gonna find out who killed the lead singer of Black Vomit?

Fuck that, I mean, the heck with that.  I kicked their ass!  Well, I tried.  There were two of them you know...

'Booty Time.'

'It's booty time, it's booty time, across the U.S.A.  It's booty time...'

What's fine?

Oh.  One more thing.  This is personal.  I want you to tell me you're a big sissy.

How's it going?

Good to meet you, Mr. Fairlane. Your mouth makes quite a reflection.  I'm Julian Grendel.

Jazz, we're talking here.

Uh, nice piano.  Probably get a lot of complaints from the neighbors -- heh...  It's another time, Julian, another place.  If I told you Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and Colleen Sutton were the ones you were complaining about, the ones who tried to rip you off, what would your reaction be?

And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?

Actually you're a bit off in the motivation department... I mean, revenge is so... Bronson.  Wait, where's the third C.D.?  How could you come here without proof? It's a three piece set here!  A computer disc from Colleen, Bobby's computer disc, and Johnny's computer disc.  Together they make, oh fucking forget it!

I just gave up smoking.  A last drink?

What about Don?

Kill them.  Not quickly.

You'd said something about proof...

You're that guy, the private eye.

Do you really know everybody in the industry?

You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right?  Do you suspect foul play and stuff?

Hey, troops, here's that rock 'n' roll detective I told you about.

This isn't music!

How nice.

So...

Takin' care o' business -- it's after midnight.

-- Well finish all your meetin' people and get back here now -- and bring a pizza with you.

Allo... Salvatore...

Everything's smooth.  Beautiful.  I will need a few more days though, the boys think we oughta cool it for awhile -- make sure there's no heat.

Look, I'll level with you -- I need a little more time -- I got to shift gears.

Oh Alain!  C'est merveilleux!  Tu me gâtes.  Je t'aime.  Attends, je vais te montrer moi aussi ce que j'ai acheté.

Regarde mon pêcheur de baleine... Tu sais il va faire très froid cet hiver.

Regarde, il te va parfaitement bien!

Alain is the only man I know who can become as enthusiastic about a bridge as he can about a woman.

Il est en retard.

Look how gracefully they conceived that arch.  Like a bowstring.  It was built from both ends.  With no support in the middle.  Beautiful.

I'm sorry, I don't know who you mean.

There's nobody like that on six.

Des Moines.

Yeah!

When ya go back on?

Why don't you do the same, Doyle? You look like shit.

Never trust a nigger.

Never trust anybody.  You goin' sick?

I think we oughta burn him on suspicion.

Popeye.

You got the warrant?

Timezit?

Pass.

There are four auto graveyards like this one in the other boroughs, handling about a thousand vehicles a month.  Those that aren't claimed are auctioned here once a month.

So whatta you want a badge?  It's your first major league game Sal. One thing I learned, move calmly, move cautiously.  You'll never be sorry.

That was over thirty years ago.  I paid for that and then some.

Yeah.

Let me tell you what I know, Daryl.  You went to Saint Xavier with Mary.  You lived five blocks from her.  You liked her.  But she ain't interested.  That must've hurt, huh?

They around?

Where's the collar, in the cells?

Oh, yeah.  Damn.  My watch is busted.

Frank.  We gotta go back.  Frank...

How was your tour?

Where's Johnny?

Then you gotta hide it somewhere. Somewhere where nobody's gonna find it...for 29 years!  Put it under the loose floorboard by the window!

I wanna be wrong here.  But we need to go to the precinct and talk about it.

As nuts as that sounds, yes.

Frank, this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl.

Daddy, come up and sing the baseball.

Daddy, Daddy, I can't.

Yes!  That's it!  You got it, you got it! Way to go, Chief!

Listen, you can't broadcast without a license.  Unless this is an emergency, you gotta get off the band.

Where are you transmitting from?

I'm right with you, man.  He's got the heart of a lion.  Hey, how 'bout the first game of the Series?

What are you talking about?  I'm talking about this afternoon.

Sorry 'bout that.

Gordo, if this is you, so help me...

Now you listen to me.  My name is John Francis Sullivan, I live at 1060 41st, where I've lived my whole life.  And I saw the first game of the '69 Series at my Uncle Butch's house with my father...

29 years...?

You sound...ground up...?

She just died, your mother just died?

You ever talk to a victim's family?  The one's left behind?  They don't act like what you'd think.  There's panic and fear.  But mostly, it's like there's this logic problem.  And if they could only solve it, everything would be okay.  But if you look real close - look at their eyes - you can see it.  Just a glimmer.  But somewhere they know.  They know their world is never gonna be the same.

What do I tell them?

I'll be damned.

John, you still there?

You all right?

We got him!  Dad you got him!

Please, Dad, just do it.

John, you there?

I better give you my address then.

Another rough night, huh?  That it?

That's what we need here, Satch.  A lucky break.

I thought it'd be nicer to eat here.

Fine.  You know Dr. Schwartz retired last month?

So how'd you like LION KING?

Wife around?

Nah, just working the job.

Who are you?

Who the fuck is this?

Sullivan?

Who brought up this bright idea?

You're all just jealous.

What're you gonna do?

What're you doing?

How do we do it?

I'm gonna be sicker than all of you, man.  Now I gotta spend the whole weekend totally straight...  I don't think I can make it, man!

I can't find the bong anywhere. Can't you remember where you dropped it?

Here.  Go down the cellar and check the fusebox.

What's this?

Derek... stop.

You haven't changed a bit.  Always so sure of yourself.  Even when we were kids, when you wanted something, nothing could stop you.

And, what about us?

You know him?

That scarecrow?  Can't you tell how weird his is just by looking at him.

We're really sorry, but it wasn't our fault.

I do like you.  But not when you act like a jerk.

I never said you were "nothing".

I thought that was the end of the song.

Will you hurry up!  I gotta get this fuckmobile back before Horace finds out I took it.

That's it.  Pull over.  I'm drivin'.

Will you slow down?  It's hard enough to read this thing.

That's right.  Just drive toward him.  He'll move.  Nobody wants to die.

Come on, you guys!  The game's over!!

Of course not.  If he hasn't already accidentally pelleted himself, I'm sure he's lost.

That's your problem, Larry. That's why your sales are always below quota.  Your instinct to eat is stronger than your instinct to win.

When are you going to stop treating me like one!

How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?

Can't you at least call the camp and make sure everything's all right?

Why?

Are you sure this is gonna work? I mean, why didn't we bring that gun and just blast him away?

You mean you had a bad dream.

Where'd you get this?

Which is?

What's goin' on?

Jason is alive.  We dug up his body.  I was gonna cremate it and...

Doesn't that tell you something?!

Mr. Duke, how can you claim that Jason Voorhees is not truly dead?

Well, let's hope not!

Diana -- you heard from Jessica lately?

...but there just may not be enough time.  If you still care about her, if you still want to try to make things better between you two...we should talk.

Jason Voorhees is dead.

Steven buggin' you?

I gotta get back to work.

Get up!

Tell me.

Jessica, I'm so sorry.  I...I wanted to have this cleaned up before you got here.

Steven, c'mon, we're not thirteen...

...and it's now ringing...ringing... and -- Hello? Anthony's Pizzeria? Yeah, this is officer Randy Parker over at the station.

Don't do anything stupid.

She asked me to come over.  She said she had something to tell me.

-- Miscarriage?!  Who the fuck told you Jessica had a miscarriage?!

What do you mean you've never made a prank call?

That's disgusting.

Steven!

A real space cadet. I wonder if she'll narc on us...

Tell me.

Right.

Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. McCulloch?

Where's the radio?

I'11 be coming around your stateroom in exactly fifteen minutes, Miss Mason. You'd better have your biology project ready or I'm phoning your parents.

Where did you get that alcohol?

You have no right...

I'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else, and I alone know what's best for her. End of discussion.

I thought I told you to stay away from her.

But that doesn't prove that he's the one!

He's doing the best he can, Charles.

I doubt very much that one even exists.

Everyone split up -- we'll cover more ground that way.

Oh, he is indeed. And ready to pull down anybody who falls in and can't swim.

Why are you doing this to yourself?

Facing your fear doesn't always conquer it.

Can't we at least talk about it?

I'm glad you decided to come after all.

Did you know that I'm giving up teaching?

I seem to detect a hint of ingenuousness in your tone.  In other words, level with me.

I can't swim.

The Captain and Chief Engineer... they've been...they're dead.

Yes...

Rennie...

I thought maybe we could hike to the top of the Statue when we got there, if you felt like it. It's supposed to be 22 stories tall.

Can he really take us home?

I think so. But we have to lower the anchors so we don't drift any further...

I wrapped my sandwiches in tinfoil. I ate and drove. I had one of those big checkered cabs.

Under the Manhattan Bridge.

Guys ready to order?

That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?

But didn't we know it would happen?

Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread.

Tonight. What's tonight?

Do you want me to tell you what it was like, reading that review at the newstand with trucks rumbling past and street vendors facing Mecca?

Is it safe?

You say we go?

What do you mean?

Had to be him.

Of course I saw it.

Let's work on it.

This could be it.

Does it feel comfortable?

What about her?

That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed.

Because we're completely mismatched.

Do you want to get some coffee?

I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?

Oh please. Not now.  She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.

Mother won't tell me how long you've been seeing this person. She's embarrassed to tell me. So why don't you tell me?

And you blame me. It's because we never talk. Let's talk.

Look. I'm sorry you keep running into dishonest men. But you're only eighteen. We can still turn it around.

I'm willing to tell you my name.

What else?

Your father said you might be here.

I've been looking for you because I want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column.

Opening night, Lillian.

And you've been extremely patient.

There may be things you'd rather not know about.

People are dependable.

All the failures, all the fatalism.

It's Stanley. It's the Steamer. Fate has spoken to this man in the depths of the night.

You didn't think it was okay when you lived here. You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a marathon.

What do you want me to do?

You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.

Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.

Now that's a complicated subject.

Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury.

I don't know.

This is something no one has been privileged to see in almost seventy years. Very few people now alive can say that they have seen what you are about to see, Matthew. The Red Sox win a World Series. This is deeply, intensely personal. All the mistakes I've made, all the envy, fear and violence that's encased in this little envelope we call a person -- all washed away in the next few minutes. And your grandmother knows why.

I had lunch with Joanna. She said she told you about Peter. You weren't concerned, she said.

I hate the Mets.

Why?

What was your favorite color crayon, growing up?

What's good?

He wears a disguise.

Do you want to talk about doing crazy things.

What? Come on, Paisley.

He feels he has to defend himself if necessary.

You've come to me. I wanted to believe you would one day.

In other words I never understood until today how much pain and anxiety you've been causing with your reviews. Steven, it's so unfair.

Here, you see? Even the South African papers apologize -- "a monstrous attack."

It is the work of untouchables.

Please! You're being foolish!

No -- prison is rather agreeable to me, and there is no doubt that after the war, independence will come. My only worry is what shape it will take. Jinnah has --

Just an admirer...

Not quite. They're only "holding me" until the Magistrate's hearing. Then it will be prison.

I'm sure your legs are quite as handsome as mine.

What was he like?

I'll take your luggage back, baas.

We only make wild speeches, or perform even wilder acts of terrorism. We've bred an army of anarchists but not one single group that can really fight the British anywhere.

Maybe I'm wrong... maybe we're not ready yet. In South Africa the numbers were small...

They are only clinging to old dreams  and trying to split us in the old way. But the will has gone -- Independence will drop like a ripe apple. The only question is when  and how.

It has. But you'd be surprised. They understand -- they really do. It's not the workers you have to worry about.

I'm sure I'm fit for at least five hundred miles.

In England, I was a poor student but I --

You mean you employ Mr. Baker as your attorney, but you can't walk down the street with him?

They're sparing no one, I see.

Good. Good.  I have thought of calling for a Royal Commission to "investigate" the new legislation.  I think I could guarantee they would recommend the Act be repealed.

You're an extraordinary man.

Assuming we are in agreement?

All right. Fine.

...There's been no time to keep figures, but there must be ninety -- a hundred thousand under arrest.  And it still goes on.

In Calcutta it's like civil war. The Muslims rose and there was a bloodbath, and now the Hindus are taking revenge -- and if we can't stop it there'll be no hope for the Hindus left in Pakistan.

Who are you trying to convince?

How are you doing this, Vincent?  How have you done <i>any</i> of this?

Is there any reason you'd want a left-handed child?

I'm sorry, there's no way we can.

And don't go getting everybody lost out there. You'll give us a bad name.  You won't have me to keep an eye on you, you know.

We're in the wrong place.  We're wasting time.

From what budget?

Surely you know what you have.

Twelve have a mission within the week.

Hello.

It's about the Director.

You okay, Jerome?

It needs work.

God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet?

That's not the point.

I gotta stop!!  I gotta stop!!

I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.

It's all right.

We can't stay here.

Where?

Not thirsty?  We've got enough virgin samples to last us the week.

Why have you done this?

Thank you.

What will happen to the others?

Hugo!  I've found him!

No bother.

Why don't we say we were together?

It's here.  My heart.  I'm careful--weekly check-ups.  I'm on a drug maintenance program, blood thinners, diet--  I just want you to know what you'd be getting yourself into.

Of course I think about it every day.

So you didn't do it after all.

What <i>is</i> this place?

What happened?

You hypocrite.  Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--<i>what</i> you are?  Don't you get <i>any</i> satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?

If everything goes to plan, this could be the last time I see you for a while.  One week to go.  Please tell me you're the least bit excited.

I've got enough here.

I guess it was because I was a model prisoner.

What about them?

Sure,  You're working on the passports...  ... and visas?

You hired Jackson and Rudy., not me.

That's your problem.

I'm in a hurry.

A little more was taken out before.  My brother's a director of that Bank, Mr. McCoy... I had a few pressing debts.

Hello, Doc.

Where do you want to go?

It doesn't look like that.

What's Beynon got set up?

You go out much?

Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.

Yeah... I know.

I didn't. I just waited.

You know I've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes... worn out waiting.

They checked in.

Tell me about Beynon's ranch.

Why didn't you tell me?

What do you want to do?

You've got it all figured.

There may be a hunting party.

From now on you just shut up and do as you're told.

Look, what you said yesterday... I guess that was right. It isn't worth anything if we don't make it together.

Jeep. There's a dry river bed fifteen miles east. He takes us to the Mexican side, drops us off at the airfield by breakfast... we've got a 9 o'clock flight.

Yeah.

I don't know, airport I guess.

How long before this car's hot?

Are we going to make it?

Whatever happens... we're going all the way.

You wouldn't be taking the train to Salt Lake, would you?

One thing though... how do I explain this to my wife?

All right. Shells?

Two.

I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way...

Drive.

Where we go in1?

Which way?

What's the damage?

You can't get away from me, Albert.

Well, he drove it into the river.

I made a mistake.

Do me a favour. You don't really expect me to fix Kinnear on your say-so?  Just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. Stroll on.

Jack?

Train goes at four minutes past twelve. You've just got time.

Address?

Everyhing go off all right?

Really.

Once a week you like a gentleman?

We went about together.

How'd you know where I'd be?

Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk!

Does Brumby get a kick out of that crap?

Tell me about the girl.

Then he must have pulled her.

And you didn't know her last name?

Let her go. She'll be OK.  Sorry about that.

Have another?

Oh, what you doing now?

That must be interesting.

Keith, if anybody comes in here and asks for me, you let me know. Right?

Nowt.

All right. All right. I want to square things with you first.

Stuff it! My girl friend's coming from Liverpool tonight.  Nice surprise, isn't it?

I won't be using the room tonight.

Will this do?

Suppose you tell me what the bloody hell's going on. It's my house, you know.

Now just a minute...

Thorpey nearly died laughing.

What you going to do?

You're a bastard.

'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.

Do you want breakfast?

Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

Well, well. Small world, isn't it?

What's it to you anyway?

Eric told me of your bereavement.

Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.

Not suede boots!

Are we here to play cards or talk about the old days?

Oh... I think I'll stay as I am.

Polacks and deadbeats.

You did?

They did.

It's too...

You're on this...

...that's right...

For some sales pro...

Who?

Starting up.

Of doing the thing.  The dif...the difference.  Between me and Jerry Graff.  Going to business for yourself.  The hard part is...you know what it is?

You don't ax your sales force.

Should do something to them.

And you're saying a fella could take and sell these leads to Jerry Graff.

As an idea.

No.

No.

You didn't?

However they are, that's the deal. A buck a throw.  Five thousand dollars.  Split it half and half.

A job with Graff.

Dave.

Listen to this.  I have an alibi, I'm going to the Como Inn, why? Why?  The place gets robbed, they're going to come looking for me.  Why?  Because I probably did it.  Are you going to turn me in?  George?  Are you going to turn me in?

Why are you doing this to me, Dave. Why are you talking this way to me? I don't understand.  Why are you doing this at all...?

You need money?  Is that the...

Fine.

I, you know, they should be insured.

Then, you know, they wouldn't be so ups...

I can't close 'em.

They stole...

He said we're all going to have to go talk to the guy.

Why don't you think so?

Yes.

See...?  Were you the guy who broke in?

Will you excuse...

Did they...?

Did the leads come in yet?

Who used to say that?

Shelly: get in the office.

...that's why I came in.  I thought I...

I don't want to go to lunch.

That's what, that's what, that's what I was trying to do.  That's why I came in...I meet gestapo tac...

I meet gestapo tactics...I meet gestapo tactics...That's not right... No man has the right to..."Call an attorney," that means you're guilt... you're under sus..."Co...," he says, "cooperate" or we'll go downtown.  That's not...as long as I've...

Excuse me, fella.

Listen to me, the statute, it's for your protection.  I have no complaints with that, in fact, I was a member of the board when we drafted it, so quite the opposite. It says that you can change your mind three working days from the time the deal is closed.

Roma, would you, I'd like to get some lunch...

I'm going to have your job, shithead. I'm going downtown and talk to Mitch and Murrray, and I'm going to Lemkin.  I don't care whose nephew you are, who you know, whose dick you're sucking on.  You're going out, I swear to you, you're going...

Mr. Levene...?

Mr. Levene, I think we have to talk.

John...John...John.  Okay.  John. John.  Look:  The Glengarry Highland's leads, you're sending Roma out.  Fine. He's a good man.  We know what he is.  He's fine.  All I'm saying, you look at the board, he's throwing...wait, wait, wait, he's throwing them away, he's throwing the leads away.  All that I'm saying, that you're wasting leads. I don't want to tell you your job. All that I'm saying, things get set, I know they do, you get a certain mindset... A guy gets a reputation.  We know how this...all I'm saying, put a closer on the job. There's more than one man for the... Put a...wait a second, put a proven man out...and you watch, now wait a second--and you watch your dollar volumes...You start closing them for fifty 'stead of twenty- five...you put a closer on the...

No.  John.  No.  Let's wait, let's back up here, I did...will you please?  Wait a second.  Please.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  One kicked out, one I closed...

Shelly...

Marshal the leads...marshal the leads?  What the fuck, what bus did you get off of, we're here to fucking sell.  Fuck marshaling the leads.  What the fuck talk is that? What the fuck talk is that?  Where did you learn that?  In school?  That's "talk," my friend, that's "talk." Our job is to sell.  I'm the man to sell.  I'm getting garbage.  You're giving it to me, and what I'm saying is it's fucked.

Yes.

...ah, fuck this...

I'm out.

Bullshit, bullshit, you assign them... What are you telling me?

I can't close these leads, John. No one can.  It's a joke.  John, look, just give me a hot lead. Just give me two of the premium leads.  As a "test," alright?  As a "test" and I promise you...

What are we going to say?

Is that what you're saying?

That's alright.

Look: I have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, I'm trying to make some sense...

The only thing remarkable is who you made it to.

I told the customer that his contracts had gone to the bank.

I sold them to Jerry Graff.

Okay: I...look: I'm going to make it worth your while.  I am.  I turned this thing around.  I closed the old stuff, I can do it again. I'm the one's going to close 'em. I am!  I am! 'Cause I turned this thing a...I can do that, I can do anyth...last night.  I'm going to tell you, I was ready to Do the Dutch.  Moss gets me, "Do this, we'll get well..." Why not.  Big fuckin' deal.  I'm halfway hoping to get caught.  To put me out of my...  But it taught me something.  What it taught me, that you've got to get out there.  Big deal.  So I wasn't cut out to be a thief.  I was cut out to be a salesman.  And now I'm back, and I got my balls back...and, you know, John, you have the advantage on me now: Whatever it takes to make it right, we'll make it right.  We're going to make it right.

What?

I...

What sales...?  I just closed eighty-two grand...Are you fuckin'...I'm back...I'm back, this is only the beginning.

I've got the check...

The check's no good?

Their check's no good?  They're nuts...?

Na, fuck the leads, I'm going home.

...the fuck is that supposed to mean...?

Shelly...!

Fuck you, Dave...

Fuck you care...?

Harriett...

And, and, and, I did it.  And I put a kid through school. She...and...Cold calling, fella. Door to door.  But you don't know. You don't know.  You never heard of a streak.  You never heard of "marshaling your sales force..." What are you, you're a secretary, John.  Fuck you.  That's my message for you.  Fuck you and kiss my ass. You don't like it, I'll go talk to Jerry Graff.  Period.  Fuck you. Put me on the board.  And I want three worthwhile leads today and I don't want any bullshit about them and I want 'em close together 'cause I'm going to hit them all today.  That's all I have to say to you.

Oh, Christ.

No...Black Creek.  Yes.  In Florida?

Ray is director of all European sales and services for American Ex...  But I'm saying you haven't had a meal until you've tasted...I was at the Lingks' last...as a matter of fact, what was that service feature you were talking about...?

Home...

Well, Ray was eating at one of his company's men's home in France...the man's French, isn't he?

Rick...?

I've wanted to talk to you for some time.  For a long time, actually. I said, "The Machine, there's a man I would work with.  There's a man..." You know?  I never said a thing.  I should have, don't know why I didn't.  And that shit you were slinging on my guy today was so good...it...it was, and, excuse me, 'cause it isn't even my place to say it.  It was admirable...it was the old stuff.  Hey, I've been on a hot streak, so what?  There's things that I could learn from you. You eat today?

Yeah.

Yes.

No, I don't know.  Tell me.

Three business days.  They mean three business days.

Today.  Today.  Which, in any case, it was not, as there were a couple of points on the agreement I wanted to go over with you in any case.

No, no.  That's just something she "said." We don't have to do that.

I can't regotiate.

What...?

What are the police doing?

You cashed the check?

Cop couldn't find his dick two hands and a map.  Anyone talks to this guy's an asshole...

You just this morning...

Bring that shit up.  Of my volume. You were on a bad one and I brought it up to you you'd harbor it.  You'd harbor it a long long while. And you'd be right.

Is that what I did?  Dave?  I humiliated you?  My God...I'm sorry...

They didn't get the contracts.

It went down.  I filed it.

...you want to go out today...?

Yes.

We had a slight burglary last night.

I know.  How long will you be gone?

Will you take me?

You've grown so tall... so tall in the last year.  You're much taller than me.

Mr. Cicci.  From the year 1927 to the present time, you were an employee of the &quot;Genco Olive Oil Company.&quot;

But in actuality, you were a member of the Corleone Crime organization.

I have a friend who has a fine rug. Maybe your wife would like it.

Your friend lives in a fine building.

Well, thank you, they asked for you all week.

It means we should all live happily for one hundred years.  The family. If my Father were alive, it'd be true.

The ink on your divorce isn't dry. Your children see you on weekends; your oldest boy, Michael Francis... was in some trouble with the Reno police over some petty theft that you don't even know about.

Is Kay coming?

Goddamn bitch.

Listen, Michael's got a lot of nice people here.  Friends of Kay's. He'll never forgive me if you ruin his party.

Deanna, will you get back into the house!

Now what is this talk about joining the army?  Eh?

You would risk your life for strangers?

I think there's only two hundred dollars under my hat.  I'm right.  Only two hundred dollars.

Ten to one shot, you said.  Ten to one shot in my favor, and I lose.

Why'd you do it, Frankie?  After all these years, why'd you turn against him?

Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally in the dark.

Count on me; that's my specialty.

Mikey, why would they ever hit poor old Frankie Five-Angels?  I loved that ole sonuvabitch.  I remember when he was just a 'button,' when we were kids.  We used to put bedsheets on our heads, you know, like we were ghosts.  An' ole Frankie come peek into our room, we'd jump up, and he'd always pretend like he was really scared. You remember?

The song.  Are you sincere with me, Fredo?

Then I'm going to confide in you; trust you with something.

The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.

I don't have a lot to say, Michael.

I didn't know it was a hit.  I swear to you I didn't know.  Johnny Ola contacted me in Beverly Hills -- said he wanted to talk.  He said you and Roth were in on some big deal, and there was a place for me in it if I could help them out. They said you were being tough on the negotiation, and if they had a little bit of help, they could close it fast and it would be good for you.

I wish they had.  He takes fifty dollars a week from my father's cash drawer.  But you can't kill a man like Fanucci.

What did I tell you.  The one who cut him was found in an alley.  And the family of the others paid Fanucci all their savings to make him forswear his vengeance.

The 'patrone' is here.

That's the first time I've seen the lawyer side of you, Tom.  It's not your best side.

If you told Michael what I've told you today, I'm a dead man.

What do you mean gone?

Why didn't someone tell me!

Rocco!

Goddamn it, where were you?

I don't think so.  Unless I'm very wrong...they're already dead. Killed by someone inside...very frightened that they botched it. That's why I am going to disappear in a few minutes, and leave everything to you.

What was it, so I'll know.

And Kay...she's all right?

How did they get their hands on Pentangeli?

They won't take him; not for a million, not for ten million.

I know you do, Tom.  Then I can count on you to help me do the things I have to do.  If not, call Houstan, and become a Vice-President. Take your family and your mistress and move them to Las Vegas.

The High Court of Israel turned down his request to live as a 'returned Jew.' His passport's been invalidated except for return to the U.S.  He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday, offered a gift of one million dollars if they would give him citizenship.  They turned him down.

You're right.

Frankie, you were always interested in politics, in history.  I remember you talking about Hitler back in '43.  We were young then.

...and the tape will be running.

What the hell are you talking about?

Senator, my client would like to read a statement for the record.

Mr. Hagen, would you kindly identify to this committee that gentleman sitting on your right hand?

Sir, the gentleman does not understand English.  He would not in any case, take the stand.  He came, at his own expense, to aid his brother in his trouble.  He is not under any jurisdiction of our government and his reputation in his own country is impeccable.

Yes.

Whose orders are these?

Why don't you sit down?

I won't let you leave!  Christ, do you think I'm going to let you leave.

If that's what it takes; then yes, I will.

You said you were Klingman.

There are still things I have to do.

Alright.  They bother me once in awhile.  Tell me, when Pop had troubles... did he ever think, even to himself, that he had gone the wrong way; that maybe by trying to be strong and trying to protect his family, that he could... that he could... lose it instead?

Sit down, this is almost over.  You follow the baseball games?

I like sporting events -- I really enjoy watching them in the afternoon. One of the things I love about this country.  I loved baseball ever since Arnold Rothstein fixed the World Series of 1919...I heard you had some trouble.

What a mistake; people behaving like that, with guns.  It was my understanding we left all that behind.  But, let me tell you, the important thing is that you're all right.  Good health is the most important thing; more than success; more than power; more than money.

You're a considerate young man.

Why...the Rosato Brothers.

They asked him to sign paper to take down the markers; but he got mad; told them to wait until he was finished.

Are you the son of Vito Corleone?

I'm sure we all agree with our esteemed colleague.  Now, Mr. Corleone, you have been advised as to your legal rights.  We have had testimony from a preceding witness who states you are head of the most powerful Mafia family in this country.  Are you?

Is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the Five Families in New York, to assume and consolidate your nefarious power?

Mr. Corleone, do you have any hotel interests in the state of Arizona? Or any gambling interests in that state?

Okay, now it's my family in Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up Clemenza's loyalty to you.  But how can I run my family with you challenging my every move?  You're too far from the street, Mike, the only way to reason with the Rosato Brothers is to whack 'em and whack 'em fast.

I want you to help me take my revenge.

Frankie, Roth tried to have me killed.  I'm sure it was him, but I don't know yet why.

Senator Geary, I speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state.  I have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here.  The license fee from the Gambling Commission costs one thousand dollars; why would I ever consider paying more?

Rosato, where's your brother?

He supports me.

Here is the six month's increase in advance.  You needn't speak to her about it, she's a proud woman.  See me again in another six months. But of course, you'll let her keep her dog.

Fuck you.

These old movies are such a hoot. They thought they were being scary, but they're just funny.

This old guy -- he's the kind of person I expected to meet when I moved out here.  Someone who's done things with his life.

He's an artist.  Anyway, he's too old to think about sex.

I like my life.  I'm a free man.

It's your job, lady, not mine.  I'm here so he can draw my picture.

Yeah, I'm a good man.  Something make you think I'm not?

Something I can do for you?

What is the good English?  All I know is bugger.  He is a bugger. Men who bugger each other.

Good.  That is what I hope.  I did not think you a bugger too.  I fear only that you might hurt him if he tries.

Thanks.  Why do you do it?

He wanted me to kill him, but I didn't.  He did it himself.

The police will not know that. They will want to investigate.

Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy?  Please, Clayton.  It will be better if I find the body alone.

My name is Whale.  This is my house.

Getting to be a warm day.  A scorcher, as you Yanks call it.

They're just copies then.  Gotcha.

Yeah?  What were some of your movies?

I returned recently from a stay in hospital.

Sat for an artist.  Been sketched.

You went to university?

Did you see this?  They're showing one of your movies tomorrow night.

We could wrap this like a toga around your shoulders.  Would that help you overcome your schoolgirl shyness?

Would you be more comfortable barefoot?  Feel free to remove your boots and socks.

No, you were middle class, like all Americans.

Is this David's doing?

What is we say phooey to the hedges?  Could you spare an hour after lunch?  To sit for me?

So you had a wife?

Oh dear.  If one must have a clinical name.

I don't mean to be a prick, but that's how I feel.

Tell me more about yourself, Mr. Boone.  You have a steady companion?

Why not?

Very well put.

You might not think it to look at me now, but there was a time when I was at the very pinnacle of my profession.  The horror movies were behind me.  I'd done "Show Boat." Major success.  Great box office. Now I was to do something important.  "The Road Back."  An indictment of the Great War and what it did to Germany.  It was to be my masterpiece.

What about your stint in Korea? I'm sure it was full of dramatic episodes.

Very good, Clayton.  May I call you Clayton?  Or do you prefer Boone?

Is that really her?

Oh, of course.  Clayton.  You finished your shower already?

You're much wider than I am.  You won't want to attempt to get into my pants.

That only leaves the rest.

After dinner, if Hanna isn't back? Can we try a few more sketches?

Storm's getting worse.

I don't know.

All right.  Let's take it off now.

Just take off the fucking mask!

I'm not that way.  Get it through your fucking head.  I don't want to mess with you.

What are you doing here?

You're a lucky man, Mr. Whale. Whatever damage was done by your stroke, it left your motor abilities relatively unimpaired.

I saw Una O'Conner a few weeks ago. She said you'd been under the weather.

Is that Boris?  Our little chum appears to be arranging a reunion.

We'll be in touch, Jimmy.

He looks plenty big.  You won't need my help if anything goes flooey.

Mr. Whale, this is such an honor. You're one of my favorite all-time directors.  I can't believe I'm meeting you.

And this is your house.  Wow.  The house of Frankenstein.  I thought you'd live in a spooky old mansion or villa.

This is the studio where I paint.

Am I correct in assuming, Mr. Kay, that it's not me you're interested in, only my horror pictures?

Twenty-one.  The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking.  The horror pictures were trifles.  Grand guignol for the masses.

That's funny, Mr. Whale.

George Cukor?  Who made "A Star Is Born"?  I never guessed.

Don't be shy.  There's time to stop before you go too far.

Mr. Whale?  Are you all right?

Oh my God.  What's wrong, Mr. Whale?  Is it your heart?

You, Mr. Kay?  How do you know George Cukor?

My monsters?

How are you?

What about?

It seems she neglected to mention it

Car-jacker. Neglected to clean up after himself ...

Fish.

Also, never underestimate the restorative powers of "Karaoke."

I think about that night a lot...

Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead, right?

Now. Where were we? Oh, yes. Kip.

My point. Yes. Simple, really. I require the best. I insist on the best. I only engage the best.  Your brother. His friends. They came to me. They wanted my paper. He was your brother. You were the best. Now. They've brought so much goddamn heat down, I may not be able to fill this order. Which would be very bad for me. Which in turn, is very bad for them...

I'm not interested --

Get out --

Well, well. You've caused quite a ruckus ...

You should never have gotten my brother and his friends involved ...

They just brought in Donny Astricky. Shot by a jacker ...

I know you --

It's funny. There's probably been five more cars stolen in the time I've been here ...

What do you want from me?

Who is it -- ?

What's this -- ?

When'd you get to town, Raines?

What for?

You seem a little hinked-up ...

It just ain't happening --

Yeah.

Donny --

Lookit Kip. All grown up...

You guys have any skills at all?

What color?

No. That was Higgins ....

I miss Orville Redenbacher already --

Yes, I do, in fact. John Wayne in McO...

Walked like a bastard... Skippin' stones and shit..

The corner of Hawthorne and Granvia. Tumbler messed up. He said the Lotus would be at the corner of Hawthorne and Granvia --

What does that mean -- ?

oh.

He's in some trouble ...

You ever wonder what things'd be like if he hadn't died?

D.W.P. Thanks for holding. How can I help you?

Whatcha got left ... ?

Hey, Kip, what's up?

Sure -

Any more ...

Hey, you want something to eat ?

So what are you gonna do?

You can handle it?

You?

We do this. Then. You're finished. Then. You're clean

You hear me?

What about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five days a week, that whole mystery achievement -- ?

Too early to tell. Nervous?

I've missed you, man ...

Toby...

You want me to buy her?

I go with you --

No ... ?

Don't go getting all warm and fuzzy on me, Randall. I'm the jane that was left, and you're the jim that did the leaving. So save the sanctimonious shit for someone who believes. The only reason I ride with you, is cause I don't want to spend the whole night with any of them other creeps!

No whistles, but a Club You bring a hack -- ?

What the hell's that -- ?

Gosh, no. Lipstick? What next? Mascara, blush, floral-print dresses?

The alarms go off ...

Now... I'm in ...

Let me worry about The Club ...

I can't. I got a back load of repairs and one of the mechanics called in sick and I haven't slept and--  Where to -- ?

This time it's for real?

What -- ?

She does have one thing you don't.

Whatever do you mean?

I heard rumors you were back. About Kip ...

Is he still working here ?

I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis. But how are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days...

What happened to Sway?

Hey, Memphis. Remember me? Toby Walker. I live next door ...

What about me?

You're gonna be okay, Toby... You are ... We'll getcha fixed up...

What are you doing here, assface?

Which way's out, man -- ?

You think I don't know? You think I like to keep this inside? But I gotta, or he'll kill the miserable bastard and he'll be there for life. It's disgusting what you have to put up with.

What? What happened?

But he was always a bad kid, that one.

Hey, Billy. Watch the suit.

I don't want any more of that Shit.

Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.

I warned you a million times.

What do you do?

It's all bullshit. I swear. It's nothing. Whatever you want, we'll do.

I've been all over town. I got a call from the bondman.  He says they're going to rescind your bail if you don't show up and sign in right now. They're going to take away the house.

You son of a bitch. She's been here.

Stop! Stop!

Don't worry about Paulie. Is he helping you? Is he putting food on the table? We've got to help ourselves. We just have to be careful while we do it.

I had everybody working.  Even our old babysitter.

Jimmy's calling every day. It's urgent.

Then you're safer in here.

Who's gonna do that?

What happened? You okay?

Okay. Don't worry about it. It's okay.

Keep 'em coming.

For Christmas. Your share.  It's just a taste.

Give'm a drink.

You want the melon?

It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.

And Jimmy's in it, right?

It was the first time I had ever seen anyone shot.

I gotta go home.

Do you realize what we're involved in here now?

Is it my fault she won't go out without her girlfriend?  For Chrissake.  Come on.  You don't even have to stay.  Jeesuz!  What's the big deal?

Tommy, don't fuck around. Put the gun away. Tommy!

Are you okay? What happened?

How is he? Okay? Are they busting his chops?

If he was so grown up he'd get you two an apartment.

You want a partner?

Who's she talking to?

What do we got?

When's the arraignment?

What'd you get? You get leniency?

It's a way outta here.

You're kiddin' me.

Oh, right.

Yah, that is a nice ass.

What do you mean "your sandwhich?" I bought it.

Did she get my Double Burger?

You got fired from pushing a broom, you little bitch.

Holy shit.

Did your Uncle get arrested?

Oh my God, I got the most fucked up thing I been meanin' to tell you.

You want us to give you cash right now?

I don't think I...Larry?

How'd you like that course?

Hey, come on pal we're in classes all day. That's one thing about Harvard never seizes to amaze me, everybody's talkin' about school all the time.

All right, are we gonna have a problem?

And what do you see?

No, there's a limit.

Excuse me. Is this the buildings and grounds office?

Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important.

I'll do the work. I'm not going to meet with a therapist.

Shall we start the, uh...

Then don't set up any more meetings.

Thank you.

This job... Do it if it's what you really want.

Yes.

So who won the bet?

You were missed.  How long has it been since we've seen each other?

Why me?

My kind of background?

Not Rick? You didn't send him to Rick?

Can we do it at my office?

Oh, what is this? Some kind of staring contest between two kids from the "old neighborhood?"

Gerry! Any trouble finding the place?

You moved?

He married his cousin.

You see, Sean? That's exactly not the point. No one remembers that. They--

Just...take it easy, Gerry.

--Ready to falsify documents because you've given him license to walk away from this.

Look Sean, I don't care if you have a rapport with the boy-- I don't care if you have a few laughs-- even at my expense! But don't you dare undermine what I'm trying to do here.

Oh, come on, Sean--

Now don't do that. Don't you do that! Don't infect him with the idea that it's okay to quit. That it's okay to be a failure, because it's not okay! If you're angry at me for being successful, for being what you could have been--

That's right! You were smarter than us then and you're smarter than us now! So don't blame me for how your life turned out. It's not my fault.

You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am today because I was pushed. And because I learned to push myself!

What do you want to do?

Well, she out did herself today...

Will, I can't believe you brought Skylar here when we're all wrecked. What's she gonna think about us?

So, you finally got a job Morgan?

I could work the pit maybe, but I could never drive like Dale Ernhart--

You're right. I know.

I go places, I interact.

I might understand that.

Who is "Danny Terrio?"

Yeah, I read those.

I'm not here for a fuckin' book report. They're your books, why don't you read 'em?

Yeah. Do you paint?

Crayons?

What does?

Sure, how 'bout "still waters run deep"--

I teach this shit, I didn't say I knew how to do it.

They could see that I meant it.

Would have been nice to catch that game though.

So you might be working for Uncle Sam.

That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road.

Don't give me you line of shit.

It's not about that job. I'm not saying you should work for the government. But, you could do anything you want. And there are people who work their whole lives layin' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have. What do you want to do?

Oh, this is your file. I have to send it back to the Judge with my evaluation.

The wrench, why?

I know.

I'll keep in touch.

I'm sorry, I don't recall meeting anyone who fits that description.

Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd call.

I bet you have a great family.

I swear to God.

You were busy? You know, I really was waiting for you to call me.

You're not going into surgery tomorrow are you?

What if I said I wouldn't sleep with you again until you let me meet your friends?

You're rich. What do you have to worry about?

All right, Mr. Nosey Parker. Let me ask you a question? Do you have a photographic memory?

Just for fun?

Not a lick. I look at a piano and I see black and white keys, three pedals and a box of wood. Beethoven, Mozart, they looked at it and it just made sense to them. They saw a piano and they could play. I couldn't paint you a picture, I probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway Park and I can't play the piano--

I want you to come with me.

I know. I just do.

I don't know. I just feel it.

Yeah, I'm sure.

Is that what you think--

I inherited that money when I was thirteen, when my father died.

Will ya look at her!

Leave him alone, Ma--Al's just billy- goatin' around--

*Some*body got to take the blame. They just *got* to hang it on somebody, you know.  An' I ain't doin' nothin' but set around.

That don't sound like you, Ma. You never was like that before.

Maybe. Maybe twenny days work, maybe *no* days work. We ain't got it till we get it.

Woman can change better'n a man. Man lives in jerks--baby born, or somebody dies, that's a jerk--gets a farm, or loses one, an' that's a jerk. With a woman it's all one flow, like a stream, little eddies, little waterfalls, but the river it goes right on. Woman looks at it like that.

Why, I ain't hardly touchin' you!

What a place! How'd you like to walk acrost her?

How many men?

House 25. Number's on the door.

Open up! We hear you got a riot.

We don't need a warrant if it's a riot.

No cop can come in here without a warrant.

Better take care of it. Store manager'll give you some stuff for it in the morning. Goodnight.

Course I'll say grace if somebody sets out the food--  --but my heart ain't in it.  Nice drinkin' liquor.

Maybe Ma'll have pork for supper. I ain't had pork but four times in four years--every Christmas.

Think she'll hold?

Well, if it ain't Tom Joad. How ya, boy?

I don't expeck we can las' much longer-- some a the folks ain't et for two days. You goin' back tonight?

I guess that's right. Have to take a beatin' before he'll know.

Lookin' for a job?

I don't stick my nose in nobody's business.

Yeah.

Crossin' the desert in a jalopy like this.

Workin'. Pickin' peaches. But I seen a bunch a fellas yellin' when we come in, so I come out to see what's goin' on. What's it all about?

I could break up some bresh if you want me, ma'am.

No, ma'am. They ain't no work hereabouts. Pa's in tryin' to sell some stuff to get gas so's we can get along.

What you mean you ain't goin'? We *got* to go. We got no place to stay.

But you can't *do* that, Grampa. This here land is goin' under the tractor. We *all* got to git out.

Where you going?

Where you think you're going?

Maybe Connie went to get some books to study up with. He's gonna be a radio expert, ya know. Maybe he figgered to suprise us.

I like the tent better.

Sump'n got to happen soon. We got one day's more grease, two day's flour, an' ten potatoes. After that...  An' Rosasharn, we got to remember she's gonna be due soon.

Know where we're a-goin'?

Make her easy, John. Watch her.

Thank God. Oh thank God.  Tommy, you didn't *bust* out, didya? You ain't got to hide, have you?

No, Ma I was at first--but not no more.

Didn' you get no sleep?

Ma, they comes a time when a man gets mad.

How's it feel, Tommy?

They know he got hit in the face.

It's awright, Tommy. I wisht you didn't do it, but you done what you had to do. I can't read no fault in you.

What is it?

I'd like to stay. I'd like to be with ya--  --an' see your face when you an' Pa get settled in a nice little place. I sure wish I could see you then. But--  --I guess I won't never be able to do that. Not now.

I been thinkin' about us, too--about our people livin' like pigs, an' good rich lan' layin' fallow, or maybe one fella with a million acres, while a hundred thousan' farmers is starvin'. An' I been wonderin' if all our folks got together an' yelled--

This ain't a groc'ry store. We got bread to make san'widges with.

You can have this for ten cents.

Some say I am.  You want to hear what happened?

Either we got to tie him up and *throw* him on the truck, or somepin. He can't stay here.

She's jus' wore out, that's all.

Ya know, you're the second fella talked like that. I'd like to hear some more about that.

Just in case. Sit up back an' if anybody tries to climb up--let 'im have it.

I never knowed it! All I done was pull that string!

What's this?

You do not.

You don't...

So, what are you doing now?

It's me. Martin Blank.

Never better.

Basically the same thing. In a very evolved, esoteric way.

That's it?

All right mystery man. I want some answers. Let's recap. Spring of '84. Two young lovers with frightening natural chemistry. The girl sits in a seven-hundred dollar prom dress at her father's house waiting for the most romantic night of her young life. The boy never shows up, until now. So, what's the question?

Are you going to the reunion?

You look beautiful.

Do you want to get a drink first?

Shoulda brought my gun.

Which would you rather...?

Even though I left, you never left me. Not just memory but a substance in my blood.

Then I started losing my taste for it. Which usually means your time is up. But then I realized it was something entirely different... I started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was... meaning to life.

Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.

Will you come with me?

Say more.

You needn't be so frank with me about your work.

If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway.

Go to your reunion, Martin. See those people and discover what they mean to you. Try not to kill anybody for a few days, see how you feel.

Do you like the people you work with?

What do you want?

Come on, live a little. I'm sorry about the incident yesterday.

I told them to kill you and they didn't.

But since we're both here, I think it's time to take a fresh look at our relationship.

Have you seen Debi Newberry?

The more things change, the more they Goddamned well stay the same.

Why don't we just do his job then, so we can do our job, and get the fuck out of here.

Wait a minute--

He's falling for her. Look at him.

Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.

Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.

They're not happy, sir.

I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.

It's good to see you. I'm sure you're curious about what I've been doing.

So what happened to you?

So it's not a meaningful symbol, or anything. That badge is just the badge of your company. If I look suspicious on your customers' property-- well, under those heightened circumstances you have the authority to, ah... To shoot me.

How's that?

I took the other road. I'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. I love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone. And you?

I'm a professional killer.

This is Annie MacLean.

Well, you know, however you want to put it -- I got your information from the publisher of the article. I called Montana and your sister-in-law, I think, gave me this number.  I'm been hot on your trail you could say because I was hoping you'd consider coming to New York and taking a look at my daughter's horse and possibly --

I, I don't mean to sound insensitive. I understand your situation. But there's nothing I can do. You just called the wrong person, that's all. I hear there are a bunch of therapists in New York. Maybe you should call one of them.

Well... yes... I had a trailer. It's not like I made him run along side of the car.

What?

Well... It's beautiful country, I'll give you that. And I could see having some kind of vacation place. Retreat. But I don't know how you do it full time. Don't you miss the rest of the world?

I've decided it's impossible to properly say hello in this place without a hat.

If I can survive rush hour, I figure I can handle grizzlies...

I thought you lived in Chicago?

Poor thing.

Thanks.

Why didn't it work out?

This is Mr. Booker, Robert.

Now, listen. I want you to stand on him.

Summers are short here, Annie. There isn't much of a fall. Before you know it, the roads are closed... the nights get long.

Two people can't just be alone together in the world. At least not us...

Look, if you want to take it in the morning, that's fine.

Oh. You didn't tell me.

Would you like to see that?

This'll be nice. We haven't seen any of the sights yet. It's history. When I was thirteen I used to love seeing things like this.

Who do you think I'm doing this for? I'm doing this for you!

I don't believe this!

We'll have more room because we're moving onto the ranch. They have this empty house near this creek. It's actually pretty... OK... I love you.  Dad wants to talk to you.

Did you ask him to come visit?

Honey, come on. Would you like to stay in town for dinner? Maybe see what movie's playing tonight?

What are you talking about?

Grace, I don't hate your father.

I don't deserve that. I have never looked at you as a disappointment. If I'm on your back to do better, if I push you to try harder it's because I want you to be the best you can be.

Well, then I do apologize... But what I'm most sorry for is turning you into a spoiled brat who can only think about what she's feeling... who can't admit when she's wrong and who can't forgive when she's not.

Who is it?

David?

Uh, yes... Sure, David.

What did he say?

Oh, uh, I meant to tell you... Alex brought that fabric over...

... And uh... Mario called about moving the wisteria?

Did you get a hold of that horse guy?

That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.

You want to do this by yourself? How? You can't take care of Pilgrim all the --

Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time.

And you think it's best if I don't come.

So, how are you doing in Marlboro country? Is the magazine complaining at all?

Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.

I miss you, Annie.

Good night.

I thought you guys were going to call me.

Oh well... branding will do that to you.

Well, uh the real reason I called, actually, was to tell you I saw Lucy at Jo-Jo's tonight and she seems very worried.

Are you going to stay in the city or go up to Connecticut?

It's so cruel.

Where does this go, Diane?

Thank you. You're all doing too much.

It's just one night. If I get uncomfortable, I'll go over to Hanks.

Good luck to you, Annie.

... well, I just think she's got a lot of nerve showing up here. Draggin' that child and that poor animal all the way...  You eat with those fingers again and you know what'll happen!  Frank, don't you think she's got a nerve?

Mixed salad.

Oh Frank, don't forget the wedding present -- it's behind the door in the laundry room.  I got her a pasta maker from the catalogue... Not that they'll know what to do with it in Branton, Missouri... Probably use it as a planter.

I don't believe they'll expect that.

I believe so. Saw it on a television show, once.

I have some brownies left over. Want one?

When you figure on branding?

I don't believe it.

Tom?

Bank out us a couple more men to run the cattle.

Well, I'd like to welcome Annie and Grace to their first branding...

Of course I have.

I wouldn't let happen.

She gonna be long?

What does she do?

There's still something going on inside of him I can't reach. So me and Smokey here, we're going to try laying him down. Okay?

Do you want to go around by the old road?

Have you heard from Judith's parents?

IT WAS MY TURN!

You shut up, stupid!

Is the poverty worse, now, you think?

If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might.

What are you looking at, young man?

Does a horse miss a saddle?

Well, that'll happen.

What stuff is that?

How's it going, Ray?

Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.

What's that?

Oh yeah? What's that?

Uh... Nikon, can I... can I crash at your place tonight?

Hold on a second!

Well, I got a lot, alright? I don't know how many but... my head hurts.

His parents missed Woodstock and he's been making up for it since. Hey, you hear about Joey's bust?

One-handed!

Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and everything, I guess you two will have to improvise the next round.

How was school?

Right. Anything else, you want me to mow the lawn? Oops, forgot. New York. No grass.

Crash Override.

What the hell is going on?

He's not in this class.

You sure this sweet machine's not going to waste?

Yeah.

Name your stakes.

Make it our first date.

Excuse me.

Yeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the principal's office.

It got you seven years probation. No computer, couldn't even use a touch tone phone.

A rabbit replicates till it overloads a file, then it spreads like cancer.

Mr. Belford?

Uh, Mr. The Plague, uh, something weird's happening on the net.

Never fear. I is here.

Phreakphreakphreakphreakphreak, dudedudedudedudedudedude... I gotta...

Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data. Junk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man.

Precisely what you're paid to prevent.

A hacker planted the virus.

So what are we supposed to do?

Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...

What is it? What's wrong?

Hello, operator services.

Purpose of visit?

I'll take you down there.

Rachel! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed to pick you up?

Rachel, I've got an expl-- I've got an explanation.

No, no, we have to get out of here right now.

Brady!

Brady! Come with us! Brady!

Hang on Mrs. Pierce.  Not that tie, on the other side.  That's not the only thing your eating Rachel.

We'll be at the Fallbrooks. The number's next to the phone.

Honey, I don't think their home.

We should call the fire department.

You know damn well about what.  You let them take it out of here.

Why shouldn't I?

Not like 'ol Ben Meeker do something like that.

Who you calling?

What the hell did this?

Like the last time? How many people killed back then? How many kids?

Oh, serious questions tonight.  Of course I love you.

Jamie, sometimes it's...

Sure it does.

I wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids.

What?

Come on Rachel!

I thought you said you were ready.

Jamie, wait for me.

What are you doing out here alone?

Kelly, I want you to close and lock all the downstairs windows.

Why don't you go make some coffee.

Fact it Rach, you are desperate.  Your just going to go in and buy a costume for Jamie. Perfectly legit.

Well do I drop you off at the Discount Mart or the Dairy Queen?

That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.

How can a man do this Loomis? Tell me.

It was Michael Myers. He's come home to kill.

Loomis. Haddonfield.

Sheriff, what is going on out there?

Okay.

Well, are we still on for tonight?

What time?

I don't see anything.

It's tragic. You never go out. You must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting so much.

Well, home sweet home. I'll see you later.

Annie, was that you?

I've already lost it.

You still spooked?

Lies.

You'll have to. He's calling you tomorrow to find out what time to pick you up.

Yes, you can.

Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was grounded.

Get him out of here!

I'm scared.

Now... First we'll talk a little, then Annie will distract Lindsey and we sneak quietly up the stairs to the first bedroom on the left. Got it?

My parents won't be back till ten.

I gotta go.

Yeah, sure.

I watched him for fifteen years, sitting in a room staring at a wall, not seeing the wall, seeing past it, seeing THIS NIGHT. He's waited for it, inhumanly patient. Hour after hour, day after day, waiting for some silent, invisible alarm to trigger him. Death has arrived in your little town, sheriff. You can ignore it, or you can help me stop it.

They could be.

TOTALLY!

Hi, Laurie, what's up?

Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?

Lonnie Elam said never to go up there. Lonnie Elam said that's a haunted house. He said real awful stuff happened there once.

I gotta go. I'll see you tonight.

'Neutron Man'... 'Laser Man'... I can see why. 'Tarantula Man'...

What about the bogyman?

DO WHAT I SAY! NOW!

How?

Hello.

She's washing her clothes.

I couldn't if I tried.

I don't think this is any time to be funny...

What are your favorite buildings, David?

Oh, yeah.

That's just --

No, really, I really like him a lot.

We're a big hit.

I, uh, I'm very surprised.

Gee, um...  I...I don't know what to say.

I gave blood before and, uh... clothing to the poor.

Yeah.

Oh, it's just so romantic.  I just want to put on a long gown...

It's really sad.

Oh, gee, I don't know.  Um...

We could...we could do that.

Mm-hm.

Now I ca-can't remember.

I always, I-I always imagine that I have things.

You've had some dizzy spells.  What about ringing and buzzing? Have you, uh, noticed any of that?

Hi, Dusty.

Are you excited about becoming a collector? DUSTY Yeah.

Child molestation is a touchy subject...

Oh, my goodness!

Hi.

Yes.  Yeah, I-I'm kill--

Where are you headed?

Well, listen, you didn't know me before Frederick.  I'd...I'd start with a beer at about ten in the morning, and...go on.

Isn't this great?  They have everything here.

Unless, of course, if-if you had some time, I mean, we could get some coffee.

No, no.  I-I-I understand completely. No problem.  Y-you're busy.  I-I-I...

e.e. cummings.  I'd like to get you this.

I-I read a poem of you and thought of his last week.  A poem of  his and thought of you last--  You'll be fine, though.  Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle.  She looks at the book.

Well, thanks a lot.

Well, yeah, yeah.  You'd love it. It's really entertaining.  You'd have a good time.  I know you would.

How's everything?

Oh!

I was looking for you.

Hannah and I are in the last stages.

Oh, no, no, no.  It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway.

I thought you weren't coming.

I-I couldn't think where to invite you without taking risks.

This is not an easy situation.

You really do have those thoughts, don't you?

I know she must be a really passionate person.

Yeah, but we-we made so many plans.

Lee...

Mm-hm?

Where're you going?

Yes.  I know.  The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself.  And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me.

I want one with you.

I don't know about that.  Oh, no, I just, see, I-I've been very, very lucky.  W-when I had the kids, I decided to stop working and just, you know, devote myself to having the family, and I've been very, very happy  but...I've always secretly hoped that maybe some little gem would come along and tempt me back on the stage...

Well, because I never thought of God in my life.  Now I'm giving it serious thought.

You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.

Isn't it enough that I can love you?

Big.  Frederick, show him the oils.

Why?

Oh...Lee, you are my whole world.  Good God!  Have you been kissed tonight?!

In-in-in-instead of the child molestation sketch, why don't we repeat the Cardinal Spellman Ronald Reagan homosexual dance number?

Look at this guy.

Oh, Jesus!

N-n-no, not that.

Yeah.  What?

Oh, I don-- Ask Elliot for that. Uh, he's got them somewhere.

...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive.

Glad you could put in an appearance.

Yeah?

Ohh!

I know, I know.

Mh-hm.

I'm so humiliated.  I don't know what to say.  I mean--

Um, I-I didn't really want to, you know, go to a sperm bank or something, have some anonymous donor.  I-I just, you know, I-I-I wouldn't want that.

No, Holly's game for anything. Holly takes after me.

You admit that we're great cooks, right?

Well, in order to get started, there's just a few things I have to buy...  and some old debts I have outstanding.

Ohh?

Doesn't she look great in that new dress?

Don't you think she does?

Ouch!

I know, no--  I know.

Oh, God...

Well, that...th-that's fine.

Not so!  No.  I think I've been very supportive.  I've...I try to give you honest, constructive advice.

I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially.  I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men.  There's nothing I would--

Oh, so loosely.

Wow, I guess I hit a nerve.

Y-you mentioned to me yourself that you and Elliot were having some problems.

This crowd wouldn't know the difference!  They're embalmed!

Mmm, I don't know if you remember me, but we had the worst night of my life together.

...and I thought I'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...

I'd never do that.

Yeah, I hope you have, too. MICKEY  I hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired...

Yeah?  Is that an embarrassing question?  Should I have not asked it?

Have you?

Well, that's interesting.  Wh-what kind of stuff?

You're kidding me.

I may, I may have to get back into it, 'cause my accountant says that I'm running out of dollars. But...but, um, no, I haven't, I just sort of dropped out for a year...

You're okay, though, huh?

Oh, I'm fine.

Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion.

Right.

Uh, gee.  Would you like to have lunch?  Uh, uh...

Okay, and listen, I would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life.

Um...look, there's something I've, uh, that's been bothering me for a long time, and I just thought I'd just tell you what it was and just sort of clear the deck here, and  that's this.

So, so you want to go out to dinner again?  I mean, is that, is that... Have, you have any interest in that, or...

Hi.  How you doin'?

Mickey?

Oh, my God.  Thank you.

Yeah, she knows it, too, 'cause she's flirting with all the men here.

Yeah.

Oh, please!  We all came to have lunch, didn't we?

You're afraid of dying? MICKEY  Well...yeah, naturally.  Aren't you? I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would I come back as a moose or an aardvark or something?

And now I have "dociled" you, have I not?  By forcing your obedience.

It's a poor workman who blames his tools.

I'm looking for...

Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?

Why me?

We could skip the Gavotte.

...why have they stuck you on this silly little roust?

Who would that be.

No, you're wrong about Verger.

...they're sending me.  Out to get Shot.  Hounding me.... they're... 

Hard up as you are, at your age?  Whadda <u>you</u> care?  Surrender.

What's new onna street?

Somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for Information, so on.

The identity of the person offering the bounty was never established.

...sir...?

What do you want me to do?

...they're from Baltimore....

We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records.

He is...?

No, I think he proffers to spend his happy hours with his playmates.

...here's to child abuse!

..suitcase...locker...

Why?

Why would you say that?  Because he sent me in there to be killed...?  What <u>is</u> this...?

No. 

Yes sir, I saw it. 

She threw a punch at a man on the team.

Because that's understandable, because. She blew the raid.

S'hotter inside than it is <u>outside</u>...even with the air conditioning. 

And you have a new wedding ring on yours? <u>La Vita Nuova</u>?-- 

Darling...

She's not the first foster that you've had.  <u>Is</u> she?

Do you like it at your home, Franklin?

Yes.... yes...

Make them eat the figurine.

...they eat the dummy, sir, they eat the <u>man</u>... I keep them hungry.  When... when do we think this man arrives.

Oh, is this your political position, you're opposed to Joint...

I came to pay my...

I realize, you're under a lot of....

I hope you'll <u>find</u> it so.  Yes.  It's <u>good</u> to see you regaining your strength...

Freud, do you know...?  Freud psychoanalyzed patients in One Afternoon.

You don't wish to <u>beg</u>...?

The girl needs help.

You want another drink, honey...?

I guess the only thing is Suck it Up...

Look what they put her on...

You should get Married.

Because you're going to help me plan a party.

I'm going to do it, and you're going to catch the bouquet.

My daddy would say:  accept with glee the things you cannot change.

Mr. Crawford asked my opinion.  Here we've got a purported x-ray, Dr. Lechter's surgery.  Do we keep it secret, or broadcast it?

Trouble is, they all seem to <u>die</u>.

Don't shoot yourself.

...the purpose of the exercise... is it because they are <u>expensive</u>...

I don't understand.

...why are we here in the <u>first</u> place...?

Ask me when we get home.

I want the money.

You were kind enough, today, to take my photograph.

I din't solve it, I didn't '<u>solve it</u>'.  I just sat a <u>dance</u> out with him.  Facts, facts, facts.  <u>Facts</u>, close the case, cavalier.

...I feel that...

Thirty thousand dollars reward.  In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his...

..and <u>humiliation</u>?  What is this new job they've...?

Then, that being so, why is today special?  Why have you come back to see me?  Is it that new file they gave you?

Then what brings you back?

I saw a man today, a man so hideously deformed who'll spend his life in a hospital bbb...

And you have decided to accept... to accept this "emotion," as you put it, to the ... the "sweepings. of the Lechter case.

Your life has been defined by institutions.  The Orphanage where you were raised, the FBI Academy, the Bureau.  If the Institution is your life, <u>accept</u> it.  Ask to be reinstated on the "Drumgo" task force.  Play their game.

He was <u>shot</u>...he was shot.  On his rounds.  And... and...

My encounter.

It's funny, when I first met you I thought you were such a weirdo...I still think you're a nut, but you're my nut.

You think you're so...but you're just...

I'm gay. Like you didn't know.

You mean you didn't have any gay thoughts when you were my age...

I'll bet you're glad I waited until the last day to have this conversation.

Summer would have been a lot less without you. You're a true friend, Donald.

That really sucked, Eric, what you did, asking him that...

Thanks, Talia...Why are you so nice to me?

You are to be executed at Dawn anyway.  Might as well commit the crime. Go to her, Wichita...

That would be a No.

Don't forget, when you get home, O.B.'s. They're created by a female gynecologist.

Wendy, don't be afraid to get a little stupid and contagious. The kids don't understand that this is our summer, too. We shouldn't have to put our lives on hold to be their butlers.

You know you just do this for shock value. It's not shocking.

Geez, what time is it?  I have to go feed Big Chief Oberon...You're right, I miss him. Wichita, that is.  I really want to be with him, but I can't bring myself to--Are you a lesbian or are you...

College was entertaining, Wichita, but after 40 days and 40 nights of this, I really think we're going to get to know each...

...and it hurts too much to keep these feelings inside me any longer...

I have to get up. Still more to do. That boy hates Asian people. That girl thinks she gave her Mom cancer by dropping a plate on her hand. Her daddy touches her. His daddy never touches him. It would have been cooler if I'd died.

Isn't this the time where one of us says something deeply offensive to the other one...We're just so different.

Nobody really changes at summer camp. They merely find out who they are and become it more than ever.  You can't be helped, Wichita. I'm not sure you can be punished, either. But let's find out...

What in the hell did you do that for?

What else don't you believe in?

So this is it, anybody you don't agree about everything with can't be your friend...

Fuck off.

Iunno.  Of course I believe you. It's so you...I didn't think it was possible                        ] for you to make me feel worse,                              ] but...you're saying you <u>deliberately</u>                        ] destroyed us!

I'm really sorry I couldn't make it to your birthday party last month.

Ronnie, I'm still a virgin.

Betty, your daydreams are a lot better than my realities, believe me. I'm afraid though it's time to get your butt kicked.

Ever since Phil Collins did that MTV anti-drug commercial I refuse everything.

How's my little cheerleader? Now I know everyone at your high school isn't so uptight, come <u>on</u>.

Oh, I have to hear this.

Take a break Veronica, sit down.

Hey Veronica, how'd that Teenage Prevention T.V. Suicide thing go?

Damn, you're a shrewd one. Shrewd.

Hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last......

Come on Heather. We want another look at today's lunch.

Oh God Veronica, my afterlife is s-o-o boring. If I have to sing "Kumbaya" one more time...

Yeah, she really wants to talk to you.

Maybe you should see a doctor.

Don't worry. We'll work something out.

That was seriously warped, Veronica.

Let's knock off early. Go to the mall. Something lame like that.

Probably just row on out to the middle of a lake. Bring along my sax, some tequila, and some Bach.

I've been moved around all my life; Dallas, Baton Rouge, Vegas, Sherwood Ohio, there's always a 7-11. Any town, any time, I can pop a Ham and Cheese in the microwave and feast on a Big Wheel. Keeps me sane.

My father seems to enjoy tearing things down more than putting things up. Seen the commerical? "Bringing every State to a Higher State."

Trust me. She skips the Saturday morning trip to Grandma's even when she's not hungover.

I'm a Pine-Sol man, myself.

Something tells me you picked up the wrong cup.

What are we going to tell the cops? "Fuck it if she can't take a joke, Sarge."

"You might think what I've done is shocking..."

You're probably right..."People think just because you're beautiful and popular, life is easy and fun. Nobody understood I had feelings too."

I don't get the point of me writing a suicide note when we'll just be shooting them with blanks.

It doesn't work on small animals!

Kurt doesn't look too good.

We killed them, didn't we?

You believed it because you wanted to believe it. Your true feelings were too gross and icky for you to face.

Football season's over, Veronica. Kurt and Ram had nothing to offer the school but date-rapes and A.I.D.S. jokes.

We're breaking up. I am out!

I knew that loose was too noose! I mean, noose too loose! Goddamn you!

It's all over, J.D. Help me to stop it.

Cool off, we're seniors.

Sex and Drugs and HBO is all I ever need! Whoa! Can you hear me! Hello Tokyo! I said Sex and Drugs and...

Dear Veronica, Heather was your soulmate.....Share.

We have to talk.  Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.

The world wants winners, I guess. Not people stained with loserness.

I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.

Yvonne hasn't been herself, either. Locking herself away in her room . . . endlessly writing.

waves a pair of new socks around. The family laughing and talking. Pauline is not participating. She is leaning back, looking morose. HONORA looks at her with concern.

I'd better be getting back. Bye, love.

He's the manager!

You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.

starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.

Juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital.

Who cares!

I'm educating myself!

I wouldn't want my private business being discussed with a complete stranger!

Fruit.

But, we're all going to Heaven!

That.

What?

How do you know? Did he tell you?

Stay still or they'll be blurry . . .

I'm sure they'll notice things missing.

This lot's got to be worth 50 quid!

Isn't it beautiful!

Well? What do you say Trevor? Que pasa?

That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on.

Allison? Why can't remember what happened to my wife? Is it something I'm on that's... that's making me forget?

You're one tough cookie, Trevor Gooding. You keep coming back to your corner for a quick fix up then go right back out into the ring for another round.

I've got numbers to back me up. Over the course of one year more Americans die in car accidents than did during the entire span of World War II.

Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew.

No. But at one point you did repeat something though. A phrase. You must have been having this recurring dream, you just kept saying this one thing over and over

Since what?

Must be nice.

GWEN?

I've got a better offer. More time off. A sort of career shift, more in the engineering line of work.

So you're just packing it up just like that?

Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.

Have we met?

Why don't you relax for the next couple of hours? Barring any relapses you should be able to go home after that.

Who's Allison?

What did you just say?

That was cold...

Good boy.  Where's is it?

Five hundred ninety two thousand seven hundred and four.

Just concentrate on the task at hand please. Listen to me. You should be giving ME this lecture.

How does feel to be Mr. Kirsty Hughes for a whole year.

Happy Anniversary, Mrs. Gooding.

Least let me finish will ya? Got one puff left.

Do you know where you are?

You mean... when the car went off the bridge?

But I saw these women. I saw their mutilated bodies. I saw their ghosts. I just know it happened I can feel it...

Dreams?

Wow. That's good. Lots of capers, huh?

And you pulled people out? You're...  a hero.

You got a drinking problem or what?

That's for Ga... Ms. Gayley.

I never really thought they'd go for it.  And then... you didn't come forward, they investigated my war record...  I kept expecting you to show up and expose me...

What have I done?  I was dirt poor and useless... but I was honest.

You got it?  Four year scholarship to a top college, plus Medical School or Law School or whatever Joey wants; pay off the $2,500 to my attorney, plus pay her fee in full, plus my annual consulting fee...

What's going on?  "Guilty"!  What is this?

He gives a good report and I walk?

Mister LaPlante, I really want to help you, but crazy stories are only going to make it worse.  The D.A. is asking your bail be set at twenty-five thousand dollars because you were arrested again while you were out on bail...

Listen, now that I owe you twenty-five hundred bucks plus, how about loaning me twenty for cab fare?

You gotta kid?  How old's your kid?

You in business with those guys or what?  I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern.

Nothin'.

Bill, listen...

He had an emergency call... a <u>real</u> emergency.

That's what I'm trying to... to... okay, nevermind.  Just lemme talk to Joey to... to apologize.

The homeless!

If you're not in the car in ten seconds, I'll have the cops pick you up.

My fault!  My fault!  This nut case goes out on a ledge and it's my fault?

What, is everybody in love with this, bozo?  I don't get this.  What about...?

I snuck in.

Listen, Mister LaPlante... uh, Bernie... Who... are... you?

Oh yeah?  A hero, huh?  Was he in the 'Nam, this guy Elliot?

You remember where I said how I was gonna explain about life, buddy?  Well, the thing about life is...  it gets weird.  See people are always gonna be talking to you about "truth." Everybody always knows what the truth is, like it was toilet paper or something and they got a supply in the closet. But what you learn as you get older is, there ain't no truth. All there is is bullshit .  Layers of it. One layer of bullshit on top of another.  So what you do in life, like when you get older, is you pick the layer of bullshit you prefer and that's <u>your</u> bullshit, so to speak.  You got that?

Is she... serious?  A half a million dollars?  In my behalf?

Uh, no.  But I, uh, wonder if you could up support... support a program to help the needy and...

You just can't bear the idea of good news.

She broke up with her boyfriend.  Listen, babe, we needja back. You gotta follow up on the jumper, find the human interest in the grim, unending tale of woe that pours from the wounded heart of the heartless metropolis.

There's a lot of confusion around what went on last night, it's not clear...

We're piecing together different accounts and...

Ticket!  What's going on?

Not bad.  But if you gotta wear a cast, you oughtta feature it more it's parta the story.  Network's taking everything we give 'em.  They wanta feed off our six o'clock whether we find the mystery guy or not.  We're very big nationally.

I thought they'd all go "It's him! It's him!" and hug the guy or something.

Gale shoulda aired that bit first, she's the one who found this clown LaPlante!  She let Channel Eight get a beat on us.

It's not unthinkable.

I haven't won it yet.  I notice you've got me scheduled on a flight back an hour after the ceremony.

Is he like that in real life?  So gorgeous?

They're great with kids.  They love 'em.  They eat 'em up.  I'm kidding.

So, <u>Neil</u>.  How's it goin'?

Hey, c'mon.

Was that your dad?

How's the new place?

Right.  So, you have a new place, you've started working a bit -- I'm sure you'll be meeting some new people.

That would be monumentally stupid. All I'm saying is --

Things are beginning to come to a head.  I can feel it.  And I want everything to be perfect.

Oh, well, do you fix refrigerators?

You must value your independence.

A man?  Was it a dream?

Mommy!

And?

Why can't you just drive me to my old school every morning?

I could take a cab on the way home.

Where'd he go?

Honey --

Honey, do you want some hot chocolate?

I hear what you're saying, but I know what you're thinking.

You could have a pool to cool off in.

We're going to think about it.

How were we -- were we cool?

<u>Now</u>, Neil.  Stop teasing your sister.

Did you hear that?

How was lunch?

I hear things in this house,

Yeah, I guess it would be good for us to get away for a while.  Maybe Rudolf got the same idea.  Dogs need a change of scene, too, from time to time.

Honey, I can't track of all the meals Charlie and I have been having.  This is a delicate time. If it leaks out that I'm jumping ship before I'm set up someplace else I could be out on my ear before I'm ready with nothing. With <u>nothing</u>.

I thought we'd be happy here.

I don't know -- put 'em in the drawer with all the Chinese take- away menus.

I think it's time I came home now.

What?

Should I come home when I'm finished there?

Let's follow 'em.

We'll get cable when the cable company is good and ready -- you think you can survive till then?

Neil, do you mind?

Do you see a man?

And this -- is the master bedroom.

Even better.

I'd like that.

Tough.

This ties in with Nash.

Anything from the bank?

I'm in the middle of an interrogation, Captain.

When did you get back?

She was a good woman.

I know that weapon.  It belonged to Juan Romeriz.  He's dead?

You?

We too are brothers, Macleod.  In fact, you have more family than you think.

The river.

Do you not hear the wind in the trees?  The songs of the birds.  The horses breath?  There is a whole world around you. Alive.  Living.  Feel it -- become part of it.  Live your life, Highlander.  It's going to be a long one.

England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.

Maybe myself.

For being a friend when I needed one. I hope our paths cross again.

That is a thought that doesn't please me.

France.

Not long.  We should arrive in the morning.  Are you going to be alright?

You've been seeing her for over a month now.  Have you learned nothing from the past?

Well?

I'll go first.

I think my Sarah fancies you, Conner.

Your words are kind and they flatter me -- but I think of her as a sister. Besides, you hardly know me.

I don't think so -- but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?

If it's good advice.

You are a very persistent woman, Miss Hillman.

Why do you stare at me like that?

I don't know.

How come you wanted to meet tonight?

Alright.  In the shop you mentioned something about--

Let me ask you something else.  At the excavation site in Scotland, the tunnel leading into the cavern had collapsed.  The day we found the body someone had moved the rocks, making a hole in the collapsed section.  What bothers me is that we found the rocks from the hole on our side of the tunnel wall.

That would mean they'd been trapped in there--

How could that be?  People don't live for three hundred years.

You wanted the truth -- now you have it.

Must you fight him?

He's fine.  He swears he never left his post for a moment.  He heard a noise and when he went back to look they were already inside.

Incredible.  The cloth -- the buttons -- it looks to be mid sixteen hundreds.  It's a remarkable duplication.

Do you?  Then why don't you go out? Meet someone.  Make a life for yourself instead of hiding away in the past?

It was not by choice.  A small matter of a mountain falling down on us.  We were trapped inside.  When the time of the Gathering came the urge to go was so strong we tried to claw through rock with our bare hands.  What you thought was the end -- was not.  This is the end.  We are the last of our kind, Macleod.

It isn't over, is it, Conner?

Would you care for some water, Conner?

Would you like to deposit this in your account?

The house belongs to Walter and Pamela Smith.  They've got two kids, a girl about fifteen and a boy younger, Jennifer and Thomas.

I guess so.

What'd you find out?

And by doing so, he would've known we have spies in his organization.

I hate that Mickey Mouse bastard.  I hated his father, and I hate Sonny, too. Always with the tan.

Worst case, it's a bloodbath.  The detectives come out with Smith's computer, and we go directly to jail, do not pass Go.

<u>Get on the floor</u>!

I have to tell you something --

I was <u>there</u>, Dennis!  I <u>saw</u>!  It's like he <u>wanted</u> to shoot that cop.

Someone should stay with Mr. Smith.  What if he wakes up?

These bushes follow the wall into the neighbor's yard.  All we need is some kind of diversion and we're home free.

If we don't escape, we gotta get the word out about the cash.  That's how we'll stay alive.

Fuck you.  I'm running this shit.  You talk to me.

Dennis?  I want you to release those people.

Hey, Dennis?  Can I let you in on a personal secret?

You oughta try on the problem I got in here.

It ain't been a good day, Chief.

What about my father?

Cops want to be rich like everyone else. All we have to do is share.  And if he wants someone to swing for the Chinaman, we'll give'm Mars.

Can you identify this man?

How did you get this number?

I gave the other one to the Sheriffs and they're giving it to the <u>real</u> FBI.  This one's a fake.

Kevin left without you.

Please get away from me.

What happened?

One at a time!  Clear the air!  Louise?  Talk to me.  What do we have?

Did you find Jane and Mandy?

What's wrong with the radio?

If you go in, you can't use tear gas or flashbangs.  The whole place would go up.

I'm not stupid!  You can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out --

We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer.

It's right in front of us.

What's my name?

The kids are in here!

How about you and your sister?

Where are you right now?

He has lots of disks.

Are the disks still in your room?

Who are you?

You dumb fuckwad cop, you fucked up <u>bad</u>!

<u>You want a blowtorch on your daughter's</u> <u>pretty face</u>?!

I guess we each have something the other wants.

What happened?

Paul!

Gregoire, there are no cockroaches in this hotel, do you understand?

You heard the Tutsi cockroaches murdered our president.

I used to work at the Diplomat.

They are all Tutsi cockroaches.

Please, I don't use guns.

Give me it.

Don't be foolish. There's more money to be made here.

Do we know who fired the missile that killed the president?

Paul, you know who this is?

They fired a rocket at us.

I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away.

No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.

Paul, this scotch is exceptional.

The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.

He did.

If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them?

I will see what I can do.

General, sir. I am glad to find you. I have found you some supplies.

Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland?

You are a marked man.

The Americans, and the UN they have you as a war criminal. You are on a list.

You lie.

I committed no war crimes.

I will try my best George but these days I have no time for rallies or politics.

Time is money, George. We need extra beer today.

Beer yes, but no whiskey.

Lets go, Jock.

Paul, how the hell are ya'?

Perfect timing.

Give her what she wants, room, food, anything. Charge it all. Don't you put her out, Paul.

Who did you call?

Don't lie to me. What's your name?

Excuse me.

Terrible times, Paul. There are bodies everywhere. I cannot stay here.

I'm afraid you will have to move room.

I'm going to put you on the third floor.

They should go one truck at a time. When the first truck gets through to the airport, then the others will follow.

Good evening, Odette, who is sick this time?

No.

Victor was not a stranger, he was our neighbor.

Please, Paul, 'til first light.

Oh, my God!

What!

How can we help him.

This is not bad news, Tatsi. Perhaps they fled or could not make it home. There is hope.

You could leave, Paul.

I have to stay.

I love you. Keep the children safe.

Very well. But if this thing gets worse, we must close. If there's anything you need, call anytime.

Rutaganda's place?

Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there.

If you don't mind me asking... Who are you?

More of Price's spook-house bullshit.

Oh, for chrissake --

You're not my list.

There must be some other way out.

Where is it??

Yeah, what the hell, I'll go.

'Less the place really is haunted.

You said that was an accident.

So, what? You're saying we're stuck here the rest of our lives?

Shit, Pritchett!!!

Uhhhh...

If you know where it is, get there!

Pritchett!

How you gonna manage that with a new blow-hole in your dome?

-- no. The basement -- the room with all the controls to this thing: big long iron levers just lying there --

I think we should have taken a right back there.

Price!!

The opening's still too small, we'll never get through!

Where did it go?

You okay?

So, what? The thing with the glass? Price did that?

It you really loved me, Steven, you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds.

-- just not always in the sexual sense.

Now, there's the simple country gal I married. Let's go back down and greet your guests -- show them the real you: corny as Kansas on the Fourth of July.

Huh. And here I had a completely different theory.

So how's a girl to know if these things are loaded, baby?

-- and who's next on your list?

-- wit...nesses --

Evelyn... Get up... NOW!

-- it's getting older by the second. Mr. Price, if I could just please have --

Jennifer-Jenzen-Executive-V.P.- Paragon-Pictures.

Sorry.

I was upstairs!

If you've got a gun on you, Price, I'd hand it over now.

-- hey! Next time give me a couple seconds notice before you wing a gag like that!

Rewind that.

No. Somehow -- I don't know how -- she did it.

But the million bucks each, that's for real?

Won't do any good.

No, you don't want to go down there. I am going down there. And I'm going to find <u><b>reverse</b></u> on this thing and floor it.

You should really open this place to the public, Pritchett -- a spa for people without enough stress in their lives.

Ghosts killed your father?

Sara...?

It doesn't say.  But that's not what interests me.  There's no death certificate for the daughter.  Anywhere.

It looks delicious...

Did you find her?!

Are you all right?

Where does this amulet come from?

What do these ingredients mean?

Don't play games with me, little girl.

Honey, isn't your friend's name Colleen?

Can you talk to her?

Aubrey, come on down and have some dinner!

My angel!

Are we leaving mommy?

Where are we going to go, mommy?

What about all my other stuff?

She's here.

I want this one, daddy.

What's he doing daddy?

I could use a little help. We have to return the van soon.

I hope we have more success than we did with the cleaning service.

What will Aubrey think?

Well maybe we don't need to remind her of it.  She has a lot more to adjust to...new friends, new schools...it would be good if she had a stable family environment.

I wish I knew more about her.

Oh come on!

I'm fine.

Do you think I'm a fool?

Maura!

I'm hungry enough to eat a horse.

Well it's nice that you were there for her.

Your daughter's been taken.

She's coming back.  Keep talking!

Well there's no time like the present.  Good night.

We must return it, if you want your daughter back.

Keep talking!

Well, you know where to reach me. The church is a stone's throw away if you want to come to mass.

Looks like we have some animal hairs in here.  Maybe some kind of a rodent.

Do you mind if I borrow it?

There's something in there.

Right.  Like last night's doozie.

It's ... I don't know.  First World War, right?

Something bad.

I like you, Joey.  You ask all the right questions.  There is something we can do but it will require great courage.

Joey, you walked through your window from one reality to another.  You're stronger than you think.

This is his first night on Earth.  He wants to close the door behind him. Like all Lieutenants, he covets command. There's a gateway to Hell through which he can be taken back.  He has to destroy it.

Hold on.  Hold on, please.  I need talk to you.

Look, lady!  I told you!  It's not my problem!  I was just there!

Right ... So ... Well, what do you want?

Yeah.  Sure.  You mean ... tonight?

God, no!  Nothing like that.  No, he died before I was born.  He died in Vietnam.  I never knew him.  Never met him.  We don't even know the details.  I dream of battlefields.  Of searching. Of trying to find out.

What?

Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one?

But I don't know anything!  Really.  I just came out of the club and the kid was already in the street.  He ...

No.  I'd seen him in there a few times before.  He was just a punk.  I'd never like danced with him or anything. Anyway, he was a thief.  He must've taken it from the statue.

The thing!  He was lying there in the street, moaning.  But he pointed at it ... 22

Wow.  Lotta books.  You read all these?

Cool.  I read a book once.  It was like all these people discovering who they used to be.  You know, like reincarnation?  It was really good.  You ever read that?

I don't know his name ...  I saw the whole story.  A wounded bird was on his roof.  I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it.  I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't.  Its pain spoke directly to him.  He picked it up.  Nursed it. Fed it.  And it got better.  Everyday he'd watch the pigeon.  Everyday the pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn. Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away.  Didn't look back.  But he heard the sound of its wings.

Every day.

No.  JP.  My last boyfriend?  He like owns the club.  You know?  You were there?  He bought the statue.

What am I looking for?

It was part of a job-lot.  Some loony- bin they shut down.  Unclaimed stuff.

You gonna buy?

... Let it define you.  Whatever it is. Most of the roses die behind the bar. This is the first I've given out for nearly a month.

Do you mind me talking about your stuff?

You ... I can't fucking believe you, you bastard!  You get me in here ...

I understand.  Their fortune was so tempting, their affection so conditional.  What else could you do?

Yes. 53

A girl?  Anyone I should know?

Really?

That's the first thing I did. Smooch the ground and taste the freedom.  Sorry I was late.  Miss anything?

So Mr. Coffee, what went down outside the prison?

It's Captain Bob's steering wheel! Remember when the Captain.....

This isn't funny.  I'm not into this.  I...

I'm sorr--Goddamn Mario Brothers. Goddamn Gates.  Goddamn Rutherford Auction House.  By the way, how many seconds?

Whoa, you better cut a bigger hole than that.

"And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo."

Now that's a lock.

That was close....

I'm a ghost.  Boo.

Alex, are you....

Get 'em.  They went down the hallway.

Ta ta, Hudson Hawk.

Grapple, Biker's bottle, hairspray, black turtleneck, Pocket Fisherman, acid, collapsible yardstick, softball, and 72 stamps. Gee Stud, this is going to be some date.  No Harvey's Bristol Cream?

With all due respect to that great blouse, why didn't I cut out her heart?

Did he mention the Mayflowers?

Anna, what are you trying to say...

Oh, the shit is going to hit the fa--

Whoa, part 2.  Does it go to Times Square?

You're not an unmysterious thang yourself.

Wha--

The C.I. what?  God, no...

This doesn't taste like cappuccino.

Selfish attitude?  I'm just some guy who wants a little nap and a cappuccino for when he wakes up, not too much foam...

I wanna know...

Way to go, Anna.

How many times do I have to say it?  I didn't put the hit on Little Eddie... Never had anything against that kooky chimp.  I actually found him, "endearing."

What's your favorite sport, Hawk?

Outbid by my own wench, quelle bummere.

So Hawkasaurus, I won't mince words...

Oh... Let's see.  There are organizations that think we wanted the "Sforza" for reasons other than putting it in the Da Vinci museum we're building in Vinci. Hopefully, these organizations think our plan has been ruined with the explosion of our replica. If I seem vague, grand.  We want a low profile on this, that's why I got Kaplan and the Candy bars involved.  I helped George help the Mario Brothers and Gates help get you out....

Remember that guy in the cell next to you who hung himself?

Hudson Hawkins gets the chair of honor.  How about a Gates-arita?  I used real hot dogs.

Guess I know who wears the penis in this family.

Anybody have a cigarette?  But seriously, do me a favor and Concorde me back to prison.  I don't care anymore.  I hope you have the receipts for the threads.

If you pull this off, I can't promise I won't kill you.  I mean, who we trying to kid?  But I will spare the Flying Nun here....

This is the worst night...

But I'm not the type of guy to hold a grudge.

Thanks for sharing.

Snappy.

So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.

...But I guess you don't really know him any better than that board does, do ya, Miss Archuh?

-- and she's dynamite!

I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.

Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.

...What happened?

...You do?

...Certain people are --

For Pete's sake, Norville!

You mean you know about this?

Hey! Where's that martini?!

I can't print this!

Archer, you're a broken record. Fact is Gunderson did design it -- apparently he's some kind of prodigy --

...It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.

Forty-four, the top brass floor say, buddy! What takes fifty years to get up to the top floor and thirty seconds to get down?

Oh, uh... Buzz... Is it important?

-- I can't have every deadbeat on the Hudsucker payroll pestering me with their idiotic brainwaves!

Wuddya mean, buddy?

Aw, please, sir -- this job, it's all I got!

...It is?

Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville Barnes --

...Well, I'm not sure where I --

...Who let you in?

...You know, for kids! Which is perfect for Hudsucker -- not that I claim to be any great genius; like they say, inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case I'd say it's at least twice that, but I gotta tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this sweet baby --

...education, were you?

...'Shnook'? 'Dope'? 'Dipstick'? 'Lamebrain'?

Not even behind your back?

My God! The Bumstead contracts!!

You nitwit! I worked for three years on this deal!

Not that way! Through the door!

Finally.

Ten bucks says she's looking for a handout.

...and awduhs a light lunch.

He don't look wise.

She isn't!

She was very sick and then she went mindless, Miss.

What's this?

If you say, miss.  And the enormous boat brought the long-ago Fathers and the long-ago Mothers of us all - chained down to the deep side floor.

I really intended going out to the Fort and meeting you long before this, Miss Connell.  I'm Mrs. Rand -- Wesley's mother.

Believe me, Mrs. Rand, he doesn't do this often. This is the first time I've seen him --

Haven't I?  I suppose I take it for granted. It's just part of everyday life here.

-- and when my husband died I felt helpless. They disobeyed me -- things went from bad to worse. All my husband's dreams of good health, good sanitation, good morals for these sweet and gentle people seemed to die with him.  Then, almost accidentally, I discovered the secret of how to deal with them. There was a girl with a baby -- again and again I begged her to boil the drinking water. She never would. Then I told her the god, Shango, would be pleased and kill the evil spirits in the water if she boiled it. She boiled the water from then on.

She can never be cured?

I prepared these for you last night, Miss Connell.

Where were you trained?

But it's so far away...

And that chair --  is the particular property of Mrs. Rand -- mother to both of us and much too good for either of us. Too wise, in fact, to live under the same roof. She prefers the village dispensary.

Don't worry.  I wasn't missed.  The only important man here is the owner.

Perhaps you ought to get on to the mill.

Where do you think you're going?

Bring me another, Ti-Joseph.  I have to keep the lady entertained.

Listen, did I tell you that story about the little mule at the plantation -- the little mule and Clement?  Let me tell you.  It's one of the funniest stories --

Have the servants made you comfortable?

I made it clear in my letter to the company.  This is not a position for a frightened girl.

That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.

Surely nurses aren't afraid of the dark?

A mental case?

Good morning, Miss Connell.

I heard about your little misadventure yesterday, Miss Connell.  On your first "day off," too.

I've no sympathy with people who can't resist temptation.

I've been waiting here for hours, trying to imagine Jessica well again -- wondering what I'd feel. I could see Jessica as she used to be, I could hear her say in that sweet mocking voice, "Paul, darling..."  The whole thing beginning all over again...

I can understand that.  Everyone feels that way about someone.

Wesley!

Ah -- that's where reason took hold.

All that you say comes down to the same thing.  You are asking me to pass a sentence of life or death on my own wife.

But I assure you, Father Walters, Miss Connell had no idea of the consequences when she went there.

An accident at the mill?

In other words, I'm on trial.

I tell you he hasn't and he wouldn't dare use it if he had.

Dr. Maxwell -- it's nice to see you.

We're all in it.  There won't be a shred of pride or decency left for any of use.  Say something, Paul!  You've always been good with words.  Put some together, now, and tell us that you're not responsible -- that every damnable bit of it doesn't rest squarely on your shoulders!

That isn't true.  You never understood her.

Well, gonna make a break for the hors d'oeuvres guy.

OK, OK, the defense rests.  Want another?

You crying?

Whatever that means Elena -- And you complain about me not communicating... I thought it was --

What's for dessert?

Don't be dim.

You've...

Damn it, Ben --

I'll drive you --

You'll get some sleep on the couch out there?

Hi dad.

I'm fine dad.

Anyone special? You know...

Holy! Well. If you're worried about anything, just feel free to ask, and, uh, we can look it up.

Um, Paul. On second thought, can you do me a favor and pretend I never said any of that.

Yeah?

Oh jeez, Benjie. Well, here you are.

Listen, Benjamin Hood. I have obligations that precede your... from before you showed up. One or two, you know, good-natured encounters, that doesn't mean I'm... I'm not just some toy for you. When I remembered some chores I wanted to get done before the party, I just did them, that's all, because I wanted to do them before I saw Jimmy.

Good-night dad.

What you been up to?

-- 73

Oh. Elena wanted to know when we could expect you on Thanksgiving. It's just going to be you this year.

Good shit.

And to think -- they met at a key party of all things.

Now don't make me feel as if I'm being too forward, OK? If you don't --

Okay. Shall we clean up around here first? Do you think it's all right--

You want to come in, get a cup of coffee -- warm up? I can either walk you home, or you could crash in the guest room.

Please don't.

Oh.

It's been a tremendously transformative year -- maybe a little controversial of course, but we're breaking down the old Unitarian barriers --

My daughter. I haven't been on a bike for years.  When was the last time you rode a bike?

Forget what?

Shit. You're not planning --

Awesome sleet and rain.

Everything's gonna freeze, the big freeze.

No candy for me?

Hey.  I'll take this stuff.

Would it matter?  And what's that?

It's not packed with explosives, is it?

Stupid!  Is Wendy Hood your girlfriend?

Maybe we can mess around. You know, only if you want to...

Why did you -- with Sandy?

I have not touched your sh--  Stuff. You watching this?

How are the parental units functioning these days?

Right.

That's I.A.'s pit bull.

My partner...

You did your homework, Officer.

Who's playing?

But here's the thing.  I retraced your exact steps according to your statement. You couldn't have seen Detective Eckhart from there.  I mean, not in that fog.

How much closer would you say you were?

Not really.

He would have liked that.

Oh, you know.  Don't feel that much. Bullet went right through.

She left the party early.  Friends said she had a fight with her boyfriend and stormed out.

What are you doing here?

What happened at that signing?

Are you sure about that?

I'm thinking I could get off with probation.  Keep half my pension.  That's all I want.

Your friend's all business.

Fred Duggar?

Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.

I was her best friend.

It was like some big fucking secret!

Down at the station?

No.

Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.

I thought maybe we could talk some more.

You're not following procedure.

Disappointing, isn't it? To come so far and find so little. Jaded ingenues, amusing themselves with make- believe...

So you have the answers...

And perhaps this is the only real evil left...

Are these not the answers you came for?

Where is she? Where's Claudia?

And yet you knew what I would o.

But you're the fairest by far.

You made us what we are, didn't you?

What is it now? You irritate me! Your very presence irritates me!

Oh, Claudia, you've outdone yourself. Where did you find them?

But you never let me see you kill, Louis.

We're immortal. You've always known that.

Lestat. Oh, God forgive us.

You never talked to me like that - in all these years.

How do I look?

They use no paint. And the audience think it is paint.

Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...

Don't make me, Claudia! I cannot do it!

They would have killed you -

What do you want from me?

Don't worry. He was white trash, they come at two a penny. I dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave, licked his wounds clean.

You really want to be with them?

You're body's dying. Pay no attention. It will take twenty minutes at most.

Where are we?

Lestat, she's alive!!!!

Do what it is in your nature to do. And you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms.

Evil is a point of view. God kills, indiscriminately, and so shall we. For no creatures under God are as we are, none so like him as ourselves.

Claudia, Claudia, listen to me. You're ill, my precious and I'm going to give you what you need to get well.

Your mama's left you with us. She wants you to be happy.

You'll come home with me Louis? Fro a little while... until I am myself again.

But I thought vampires didn't like the light.

What can I do to put you at ease? Shall we begin like David Copperfield? I am born, I grow up. Or shall we begin when I was born to darkness, as I call it. That's really where we should start, don't you think?

You loved your wife, surely.

Is this what you want? You ask me for this after all I've told you?

Storm season?

I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.

I'm not crazy...I'm not crazy. He's here...  We've got to get to the radio and call for help.

What do you mean?

I don't know...

Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.

Ray...what are you doing?

I love it here.

You've got all these theories but where is he? Where? Where's your fisherman killer?

The shower again?

It just takes time, Julie. It's gonna get better.

It was one year ago...

This was not my idea.

Julie? What's wrong?

Oh, Will! I'm sorry.

No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry.

What? What are you talking about? Where?

Estes came after me with a gaffing hook.

...Why?

You sure you didn't pick up my hair tie?

I used to be a lifeguard...I'd hate to have to blow my whistle.

Somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting psycho.

I'll come with you.

Come on, it'll be fun.

Ahh, that feels great.

Why? He can't help us.

Jeez, that's a full carat --

What's the matter, boy trouble?

He leave you?

There's ten people on this whole island and they're all gonna end up in this Jacuzzi with us.

I'm just saying what all of you are thinking. It's bad enough gettin' rained out without having to hold her hand the whole time.

They're around...They just don't care about us 'cause we're the contest winners.  Let's go find Stoner Boy...Make his lazy butt hook us up with fishing poles or Ping-Pong paddles or something.

This was the temple of Hades --the God of the Dead. It contained no images -- just empty space and walls of perfect symmetry.

You're just talking nonsense.

I'm afraid so. There were rumors people were aroused. Some feared restlessness among the dead you know, the old superstitions.

Another sad task. We'll bury her tomorrow.  I think we'd better lock the door for tonight. It will make them less uncomfortable.

You were singing, weren't you? A beautiful voice, Miss St. Aubyn.

I adore hearing Thea sing -- but my poor head's beginning to ache.  I'm so sorry.

I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..

Oh, no - it's too delicious! You're making it up!

Tell me about them, Thea. They have great wings end long teeth --

My father -- I'm alone, Oliver, completely alone!

Has she spoken to you of her father and her mother?

Thea, your choice is a very simple one. Either you want to claim him as your father, or you do not.

What if he is?

Why, I'm fond of Thea.

No. No. I won't believe it. He's not dead.

Woman, what are you doing here?

No, I want more than that. I beg you General, make sure --drive a knife through my heart -- anything.

There is something evil about her.

It makes me fear her.

I've seen men die drunk - and I've seen men die of the plague.

That's ridiculous -- Thea's lovely, gentle -

I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.

Times are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot of these people are out of work.

Mr. Potter, what makes you such a hard-skulled character? You have no family  no children. You can't begin to spend all the money you've got.

Hey, this is the company's posters, and the company won't like this.

Hurry up . . . hurry up . . . hurry up.

George . . .

Stand back.

What the Sam Hill you yelling for, George?

Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.

Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.

You have no car.

Oh, I don't know. Either I'm off my nut, or he is . . .  . . . or you are!

Look, I think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around here.

Then if I wasn't born, who am I?

Poor George . . . Sit down.

A boy?

What did you stop it for?

Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist.

I know. I know. He didn't go.

Hey, Violet!  Hey, listen  that's Violet Bick!

I want the Board to know that George gave up his trip to Europe to help straighten things out here these past few months. Good luck to you at school, George.

Oh  Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along.

On V-J Day he wept and prayed again.

Wait now. Where do you think you're going?

Look, Daddy . . . paste it.

I'm not sleepy. I want to look at my flower.

Oh, now, don't rub it in.

Uh-huh.

Hmmm . . .

Hmmm . . .

Well, here's your hat, what's your hurry? All right, Mother, old Building and Loan pal, I think I'll go out and find a girl and do a little passionate necking.

Anything I can do back here?

Oh, it's wonderful.

Mr. Gower! Mr. Gower! This is George Bailey! Don't you know me?

I know it's soon to talk about it.

Yes . . . Yes . . . You're right, son.

What do you mean, and be bored to death?

Mary . . . Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go.

George.

What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?

All right now, what happened? How did it start?

When?

George, was it a nice wedding? Gosh, I wanted to be there.

Yes. Well, most people say you stole all the rest.

Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in  providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.

Yes, sir.

Well, I don't.

Me?

Do I look as funny as you do?

Eighteen.

Too young or too old?

Ouch!

Hello, Mary. I just happened to be passing by.

About what?

It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them.

No, I don't want to be rude.

Oh . . . yeah, yeah. That's all right.

George . . . George . . . George . . .

Is it snowing?

The doctor? Was the doctor here?

Is she running a temperature? What is it?

Where're you going?

Well, then . . it's usually customary to bring the money with you.

My hair's getting wet!

Oh, shit.

It's okay, it's okay....

Who's that?  Quick -- I'm in love.

Putz -- that won't be for hours.

They're okay, if they got little white canes and tin cups.

Over here.  I want you to meet somebody.

What is it?

Goddamn it, Sean, you listen to me or I will kick your ass, do you hear me?

I thought you said she was going with us?

How're we going to do that floating on this garbage...?

Chief Brody -- can we go?  Please?

Tina!

What about that camera?

I'm going out there.

Do I have to?

I'm going.

Michael.

I passed out, but I'm okay.

Let's see -- you got a minute?

Look at that:

The shark that did this.  It was a shark, wasn't it?

Probably.

And sound.

Do I have to talk to those two?

Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?

Mmmm.

Where's my day book?

That's what I said.  Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff?

The goddamn smell is always the same. 

Sean's asleep.

What?

They have no right to treat you like that.  You've given them every- thing.  For four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island....

Are you serious?

No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing.  Be realistic.

And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches!  In New England? We all lost on that one.

Bullshit.

What am I, an ass?  When you called me, I called Elkins, and her bosses. Nothing she saw is proof of anything.

When?

Some people.

Can I go with you today?

Hi Dad.

They made me go with them.

She just likes to tease.  I think she really likes you.

No class.

That's what I want -- a gaff rig.

The wind drift is lateral.

Take a break for a minute, okay?

Come on back up here!

All of them.  Mike, Junior Vaughn, Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy -- all that whole gang.

It comes here from Cable Junction.

You do everything your parents tell you?

I thought you were grounded.

What's wrong?

Faster!  Faster!

What about me?

Heading back?

He's got to help or it won't work.

I don't think she's such hot stuff.

Do I have to play with the little kids?

You're going out.

I want to go with you!

Michael....

I think we got a couple of live ones.

So it can't be done like that.  The man's a menace, plain and simple.

Go on, Doctor.

I don't understand.  Overman's too good a diver to disappear.

Sure am.

You see the three-quarter socket?

Well, don't worry about your fiancee.  We'll watch over her.

Till this opens, not our wedding.

You called, Doctor?

How come?

Yeah, you really don't like him.

Damn it!

Let's head to the gate and work our way back.

You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.

... If nothing's wrong, why are we stopping here?

Yeah, and so will I be if I start swimming in that blackass jungle.

What mind?  If I had a mind, I'd never have let you talk me into this.

How the hell did it get in here?

You're going down there again?

Kathryn...

You want me to stay?

No, we'll go through here.

I did.  He wants it on exhibit.

Honey, what is it?

Yes, you can.

What's the big deal?  A shark got Overman, and we got the shark.

What did you just say before? About water flowing through them?

Come on!

I am.  You're not.

Okay now.  Have Flipper flip or something.

I can have them walk backwards.

I told you, something's upset them.

Three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world's ever known.

Let's hope he knows that.

How's sleeping beauty?

I like it when they wake up.

Some miss all their shots.

That's what life is, Doctor. Full of chances to hurt yourself, or somebody else.

That's because I am the shark.

Sharks have to keep moving.  They can never stop or they'll suffocate. If water isn't always flowing through them, they'll die.

He's a young one.

When did this happen?

No one's ever done it before. It was a good try...

Sean.  Sean, where are you?

Sean, do you have herpes?

Isn't this fun!

Take it up.

What're you doing later?

Back, Kelly.  Lean back!

Yes, there is goes.

Hutton, how the hell did you get my crane?

Yeah, well I didn't!

You set that thing off down there, you don't know what will happen.

Watch it, Brody.  You're ruining the shot.

That's how they do it, you know. Seizes its prey and shakes its body savagely.  Teeth gnaw through a man like a buzz saw.

I will, old boy, tomorrow.  Our work is done here.  Just came to say goodbye, and good luck.

No, South Georgia.

The world's southern most reaches.

How far away is filter number four?

Let us know as soon as you have anything.

Big bust!  He confiscate their water pistols?

He taught us good, though, didn't he, Sean?  We were lucky to grow up the way we did.

Gee, it's good to see you!

Come on, let's go.

You and Kathryn gonna stay here?

Sure.

You'll spoil her.

Thea....

Come on, sweetheart....

I take out the garbage, because...I'm glad we got that straightened out....

What the hell are we arguing about?

Where have you been...?

You knew...?

Usually it's all he talks about...You mustn't worry....

I used to worry...But you know what happens, you find out that scuba diving's safer than climbing into the bathtub....

At least he doesn't have a beard....

All he did was kiss me....

We will...We'll have a lot of time together.  What are you going to do now?

What the hell's it doing in warm water anyway...?

They won't kill it....

I see what you're doing....

We don't want any....

Yes!

No one.  Nothing.  We've got to get this finished before the tide comes in.

I put everything in my room.  My Teddy bear is joining us.

It came for him.  It waited all this time and it came for him....

You're damn right I'm serious....

I didn't mean to start that....

I'm not going to bother you anymore about your work....

That's it?  Good...I thought you'd break out the champagne....

You and Sean used to make....

I want you all to come to Amity this summer.

Promise me you'll be all right....

Flies the plane....

You're impossible....

What's wrong?

The kind with an umbrella in it....

Couple of more passes and I'll buy my own airplane.. Hell, maybe my own airline....

Would you suffer through a dance with me?

I'll nick the boss' plane again....

I borrow it without telling him....

Only if he finds out... It's a short hop to the Caribbean.  We could take a few days....

You sure you don't need glasses?

I don't know why I fish here...Never catch anything...Must be a sign under the water...'Beware, Hoagie's here....'

Can you keep a secret?  Something no one else knows?

Come on, Hoagie....

I wish there was something I could do....

Let me speak to Ellen....

How many...?

I know how to tag a damn conch....

I stuck them on, man....

I wish you wouldn't say that....

What for?  We've got a job to finish ...Why are you making the monitor?

You sure you've done this before?

How long?

I'm coming...How close is it?

Stop that!

Wait for the sucker to charge, then hit the switch.  Just like taking a picture.

I'll do it, Jake.

Where's Lenny?

Cow tipping?

I'll take care of it.

Did you like that, Mama?

No, Sir. I haven't started till Monday. I'm a "tourist."

There's nothing in the files?

Why don't you dump it? Mail it off. Give the fucking F.B.I. a present?

We're going.

What do you want it for?

Six girls over a period of 18 months, and give or take a head or two, the M.O.'s exactly the same. Dark hair. No hands. All shot with a high velocity twen- ty-two in the back of the head.

They possibly did - but they nev- er had a head, so they never had a bullet - and they never got an I.D. - not on any of em - never bust a homicide unless you know who your victim is - we're the first to get a positive identity.

I wanna take that fucking Blind In- stitute to pieces .. Every address book, every phone call, everyone in and outta there in the last 5 years ..

No, I think you'll find I looked like he could have? By accident even? He's up here spraying the scenery all day.

God, it pisses me off, Ross.

Stop it.

I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion.

What if we need a back up?

Probably making him feel a bit antsy seein it back on the wall. He worked a lotta time on this.

Have you got a print from the hand?

Alright, you got it. And I'll be putting an Observer in with you.

I'll sign anything you want. <u>Please</u>. Bring here her .. <u>I want Helena here</u> ..

Week or two.  Musta been on the ker- osene.  Stinks like a diesel engine.

Is this normal?

I may have said some- thing. I don't recall.

Don't you know nothing about this guy? He <u>reads</u> the newspapers. Col- lects the cuttings. When are they gonna find her? Now he's reading Helena Robertson's name, phrased like she's a fucking witness. You couldn't have done anything more stupid if you'd sat down & tried ..

I know what a "witness" is.

I've told you the truth. It isn't me .. I've never call- ed Ross "Freddy" in my life ..

No.

John? .. You never said that on the phone? .. What makes you think his name was John?

D'you have a dog? Seeing Eye Dog?

Did Amber have a dog?

Have you been here long?

What are you reading?

Oh.

I'm sorry .. I don't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. I feel like everyone's looking at me ..

She runs a kind of hair dress- ing and you know, beauty salon ..

I know what you're like ..

Why?

What are you doing, Travis?

Who sought the warrant?

Yeah, I guess I do.

How you doing on those shoes?

No it isn't .. It's Californian ..

He's happy, darlin ..

Except for the hair color, she looks just like Suzanne?

The coroner wants to know if we can release the derelict?

Don't ever stop fucking me!

I know.  Sorry I threw a scare into our lives there --

I just heard.

It's all about you, isn't it? Soothe me, save me, love me --

Don't say it.  We're both ragged out right now.

You've never been alone and you can't be alone --

Reporters, Jerry.  They been callin' all night.

Look, Rod, just get on the camel!

And I guess we didn't talk about money.  So, I'll just dive in --

Honey -- later, okay?  Whoop.  Wait.

... light.

Happy for us... okay.  Here's the number. 404-453-2222.

Hey you.

Oh my God.

Drinks.  Food.  Plus, I called you a cab.

Me too.

Well.

Don't worry about it, boss.

Yeah, I did.

Look, the other night, I want to apologize.

Another time, okay Dorothy?

What --

I don't know --

There's no question you'll be friends. Of course you'll be friends.

You know how much those Well Child exams cost --

Easy, hon, I was just looking for fun details --

Oh yes.  Jerry Maguire!  My agent! This is a fierce, loving individual, I love this man, he is love, he is about love -- my ambassador of kwan.

I'm sorry, I --

It's a very personal, very important thing.  It's a family motto.  So I want to share it with you.  You ready?

I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby?

You're loving me now, aren't ya?

Good.  I was just testing ya.  But just you saying that? Makes me love ya.

John Taylor.  J.J. Stokes.  Andre Rison.  I SMOKE all these fools, and yet they're making the big sweet dollars. They're making the money, and I got an agent that ain't even put the number on the table.

I got there from "coin," dude. Coin, coin... kwaaaan.

Do your job, man, don't tell me to dance.

I'm out here for you!  You don't know what it's like to be me out here for you. It is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that I will never fully tell you about! Okay?! Help me help you help me help you.

Dude, know your art form.  If you put the camera down here, looking up, I look more powerful.  There's no need for a camel... you got ME.

That's an answer.

Beautiful.

You're with the sports people on the plane, right?

They do, my brother.

Let's go the zoo.

You said "fuck".

I won't tell.

-- I give you my favorite animal in the zoo.  Are you ready for the weirdness, the strange perfection and truth of...

ERRR-IIIC!

Oh, my God.

Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad idea!

Stop that. Dr. Grant says this is dangerous territory.

Well what's the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him?

What?

I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...

Eric! Are you here?

I don't remember

Sweetheart, you're okay.  You're okay.  You're okay.

He could have died.

Either that, or the government will firebomb it back to the Stone Age.

Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, thats where he's headed.

PAUL!

We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to.

Let me tell you a few things about you Dad, okay? He's very very very clever, very very brave, and he loves you ever very much.

That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna. The second island.

You rented an automated litter box.

Absolutely not.

I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see skin.

How would you classify it?

He used to know me.

Good luck with the fund raising.

Eric, your parents are both here.

They'll never make it. I mean, they can't manage when the cable goes out.

You're Alan Grant, aren't you?  I read both of your books.

Found this, but the battery's dead.

Did you read Malcolm's book?

Know what this is?

How much of this island have you explored?

We climb down to the barge and follow the river out to the ocean. With any luck, the Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up.

What do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs?

What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby?

You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time.

What the hell is going on? What are they doing?

There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there?

How did you know?

But alone?  We always had great success together, you and I.

How do you mean?

You think I'm all talk, Eddie?

Is there an antidote?

What are you talking about?

No, no, no, no, no, no . . .

I've been putting this together for over a year.  I have personal suggestions for your entire team, phone numbers, contact people.  They won't believe you about what they're going to see, so don't bother trying to convince them.  Just use my checkbook to get them there. I'll fund your expedition through my personal accounts, as such money and equipment as you need, but only if you leave immediately.  If we hesitate, all will be lost.

I'm not going, John.

Do you have chromium tapes?  The others fog in high-

But he's the head of InGen!

Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?

How could you possibly?

"InGen."  What's InGen?

What are you guys gonna do?

Carnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do you want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar?

You rally think this'll draw the parent?

Had to.  To keep him still for the trip.

We took to the rock.

You know how to work a radio, don't you?

No way.

There' no reason for name calling.

Lava?

Head for the roof!

You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?

He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.

The kid scores with cheap sentiment.

Ruining everything, that's what they're doing.  You could choke on the diesel smoke already!

Hold it down, Nick!

We have to send someone to look for him!

What?

Fences are failing, all over the park!  A few minor systems, he said!

Are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours? I mean, what's hanging us up?

But would we get the phones back?

The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island, but we could use it now.  Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. Animals can't manufacture the amino acid lysine.  Unless they're continually supplied with lysine by us, they'll go into a coma and die.

Oh, I'll get 'em all.

Yes.  We know they're toxic, but the animals don't eat them.

Alan, these aren't bones anymore.

Once we have control again we - -

The taphonomy sure looks that way.

You know, if you really wanted to scare the kid you could've just pulled a gun on him.

The what?

Anything else, you old fossil?

And what are those?

Wait a minute!  How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis?!?

Oh, shit.

Oh Ellie.  It's so beautiful.  It's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.

- - a gizzard - -

Are you sure?

What about the lysine contingency?  We could put that into effect!

And scary.

Uh - - thumb!  The same way.

Dino droppings?

What's this I hear at the airport Hammond's not even here?

John, we - - what I'm just saying....

And his book was a lot fatter than yours.

I'm stuck.  The seat's got my feet!

Okay, that's not so bad, ah Tim?

'Course you could just wait in there while we go back and get help.

It's okay to call them brontosaurs, Tim.  It's a great name.  It's a romantic name.  It means "thunder lizard".

Take a bite, take a bite.  I'm not letting go.

Are you crazy?  What if you miss?  I hate it up here.

So you two dig up dinosaurs?

Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?

What's to be scared about?  It's just a little hiccup in the power.

Where does he think he's going?

Well, I'm afraid I do.  There's one, a particular pebble in my shoe.  He represents my investors.  He says they insist on outside opinions.

Well, it's - - right up your alley.  Look, why don't you both  come on down for the weekend.  Love to have the opinion of a paleobotoanist as well.  I've got a jet standing by at Choteau. 

I could compensate you by fully funding your dig

Mr. Hammond, I've decided not to endorse your Park.

It's safe?

All night?

Go away!

Shhhh.  Tim, I'm right here below you.  Easy catch. One, two, three.  You count it yourself.  One, two, three - -

I am gonna have to find the others and get you to a doctor.  Will you look after Tim, Lex?

Don't do that!

Alright Donald, alright, but just let him talk.  I want to hear all viewpoints.  I truly do.  I truly am.

You're right, John.  You're absolutely right. Everything's my problem.

Why didn't I build in Orlando?

No, no, sh, sh, sh - - stop!  Stop! Stop!  Don't let the monsters come over here!

You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!  The power's coming back!

Hello?

You tell them if they come up to seventy-five, I'll cut them in on the Crystal Lake package.

Chain saws.

No, but...

Beautiful trees... sturdy trunks... lots of branches...  We can do some great logging up here.

Okay... well... I think it's this way...

Oh my god... this is his house... _we're in his fucking house_...

I seem to recall arguing the same thing in court while you were trying to file murder-one charges.

Ruby, come on. You witnessed a brutal triple murder and you're having trouble accepting it.  Think about what you're saying. You really expect a jury to believe that Jason has a mystery killer living in his tummy?

What happened?

Ruby... this guy almost took out an entire Tactical Response Team. You can't expect me to just leave you --

That's right... it... it came right out of his chest...

Now... I think the video store's open for another couple of hours. Let's go.

You watch this garbage?

Oh?

That's the problem with this case. Everyone thinks they know Jason's life story. But they don't. What you're remembering is a _movie_. Fiction.	In the movie, Jason's mother runs around, killing people after Jason drowns in Crystal Lake

Don't get me wrong. I don't care. But the professional part of me is interested in how you rationalize what you do.

How long will he need to be asleep?

Uh-huh...

You saw him?

Ten minutes...

-- Merely in the interests of order.

Where do you get your ideas?  Only joking -- I'm just joking.  Let's go to a brothel then, Kafka, come on.

You work in the cemetery.

-- Oh, yes, determination runs in the family.

Will you do me a favor then?

If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.

A true friend would do it.

The keeper of the files is still waiting for your final summation of the Erlanger claim.

He's usually in the storage room sorting things out.  He can't close the file on a case until he has the concluding report.

In an organization as efficient as ours, if a document once in a great while gets lost it might never be found at all.

Are you looking for Gabriela Rossmann?

Good morning --  Or should I say good afternoon?

It's my place to offer advice, not yours -- and by advising the Chief Clerk of your unpunctuality it's certainly not my situation that's compromised, if that's what you're implying.

To do my work well, I have little time for --

Well, I --

Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --

I'm sorry, but I just wondered --

He wasn't robbed.  He was identified by his wallet.

Are you free tonight?

I nominated you as a possible candidate.  You were Eduard's good friend.  He read me some of your work.

They're not obliged to tell.

Of course it could -- Burgel's been trying to get me thrown out as long as I can remember.  <u>He</u> could've killed Eduard.

Or what if there really <u>was</u> an error? -- I don't know what kind -- any kind that needed correcting -- and what if Burgel was responsible for it?  One mistake -- even a small one in a firm like ours -- it could cost him a promotion.

What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.

Gabriela ...?

I know how they reward failure. If they saw this I'd be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon -- with all the others.

I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.

He might have had a drink or two, despite what you think.

He wasn't a lonely man, though.

I'll bear that in mind.

But that's just my point -- she was more than upset, she was livid. She slammed every door on her way downstairs -- except that one.  I was just behind her and I didn't even hear that one <u>shut</u> -- not at all.

I didn't realize you'd been here that long.

-- I was just trying to finish some work!

... Why take me into your confidence?

-- Gabriela, on the other hand, had made an enemy of this man Burgel.

Through a very unfortunate -- and I might add extremely rare -- mishap, a document intended for the one department was sent to the other.  And for the first time -- though your friend wasn't aware of it -- two and two could have been put together to make one.

-- You seem amused.

What's the matter?

I did read that.  They gave him a posthumous medal.

Once a file's been sent to the Caste, is it possible to recall it for review?

Where do our records go to in the Castle?

Women are all you have on your mind!

It's not our fault.  We're naturally nervous.

I understand he was wounded in the lung.

Then that's the place for us!

Hi - Carl Denham. I'm A big admirer of your work, sir. I've loved all your discoveries. I really want to work closely with you on this incredible find. It'll be good for you and good for me.

What have you got there?

Now look at this fine example of early Hindu art ... I don't recall any sketches of this passing across my desk ...

Holy God! The mummy walks!

I can't imagine you crying.

It's the same image - Kong!

Oh Jesus ... you took it.

I tell you it doesn't exist!

You are most kind. We will be proud to assist you!

Bree -- honey - please, we're waiting for someone.

Honey, a couple of years ago, with Jane and Frankie? -- Jane sent me a Dumper --

Mm.

Guess!

Do you always have to repeat?

A few more days. We know who did this.

Arlyn and Jane commited suicide. He said they commited suicide.

Is that what he set me up for? Everything he's told me from the beginning? -- don't worry, don't --

I don't have to look at anything. I don't have --

Oh no.

What is it?

Nothing. Except he wasn't kidding. Usually it's a fakeout, you probably know. They pretend to tie you up, and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you --  Hell it's their money. I'll hang from the shower rod and whistle Maytime. Except this guy was really tripped out on it; he --

Well could I have them back now hon? -- those tape recordings you've got downstairs -- OK? -- and if you want you can have a good time and I'll have a good time and--

Everything that's happened since Tom Grunemann disappeared. The phone calls and the --

What about the other things you've reported? --  -- being followed on the --

-- you perverted hypocrite square bastards.

Can't you get him?

You asked me where I got that date with the dumper -- Frank sent me on it.

What did you expect? Frankie still has a good string, three girls. Figure three hundred a week from each.

Did you like my friend Frankie?

-- Us city folks? The sin, the glitter, the wickedness?

It's kind of late.

The same as Jane McKenna.

The next few weeks I would like to know where you are all the time.

No, you can find some other way.  Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to --

Please.

No.  Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.

I'm still scared.  I mean different but still.  Look, I made it very clear from the start, you're a yokel, you don't excite me, you don't even interest me, and so I only have one question which is what the hell are you doing in my bed?

You and I -- a relationship.

Go down in my room.

I called Trina.

I got a call from Ross this morning. Cable owned a plot of woodland -- he'd go there on weekends. They found Tom Grunemann's body buried there. They've notified his wife.

Look, why should it be yes or no? Can't we keep it going and see? I mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see. People do that, that's realistic.

You don't believe that either, do you? Why can't you see my side?

Can I carry something for you, to the car?  Will you kiss me?

I'm flying back out to Pennsylvania Friday; I'll fill them in on things.

You said he was no possible connection with Tom. The Page girl told you that, not Tom.

It's a beautiful day in Tuscarora - I don't envy you that humidity in the city.

I'm sure the FBI and the Police explored that possibility.

Thank you. Goodbye, John.

I'm looking for a man. Tom Grunemann.  Bree thinks he may have been the dumper -- that call she had two years ago. She says you sent her on it.

They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?

You don't tell them. That one of their own in-laws laid a dumper on them?  Peace in the family.  Beyond that, I don't know. All she wrote.

-- Usual case history -- this isn't a medical confidence, it's all of them -- broken family, lonely, confused, crummy childhood, early promiscuity, formal prostitution beginning in her teens, income twenty-five to thirty thousand a year.  Oh they don't keep the money: they get rid of it, they get pimps. Why?  Why do you want to know all this?

No. She had every good intention of it -- coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting herself to an acting career.

Town Police.

But if Cable killed Grunemann why would he get you hired to look for Grunemann?

Sounds to me you better shake him again. Put him in a spot he has to do something more -- but this time give him a time and a place to do it.

He's right you know. Waiting for the pusher, she'd tell you anything.

Are you closing the case?

Where is the child?

Oh, sure.  Here, this can be mommy.

Show.

What about my orange juice?

Will she pick me up after school?

Well, I see the Yankees finally won a game.

That's not the right soap.  We use the kind in the green and yellow box.

Not on your life.  That's it. I've had it with crap around this house.  From now on, no more pizza!  Get it?  Starting right now you can eat real food like a normal human being!

Sleep tight.

Billy.   This is Dr. Alvarez. She would like to talk to you.

Are you going to remarried Phyllis?

No, son.  Daddy and mommy will never get remarried.

What don't you understand, pal?

Now then, Mrs. Kramer, would you tell the court how long you were married?

Yes...Look, during the last five years we were married, I had...I was getting more and more...unhappy, more and more frustrated.  I needed to talk to somebody.  I needed to find out if it was me, if I was going crazy or what.  But every time I turned to Ted--my ex-husband, he couldn't handle it.  He became very...I don't know, very threatened.  I mean, when- ever I would bring up anything he would act like it was some kind of personal attack.  Anyway, we became more and more separate ...more and more isolated from one another.  Finally, I had no other choice, I had to leave. And because of my ex-husband's attitude--his unwillingness to deal with my feelings, I had come to have almost no self- esteem...  At the time I left, I sincerely believed that there was something wrong with me--that my son would be better off without me.  It was only when I got to California and started into therapy I began to realize I wasn't a terrible person.  And that just because I needed some creative and emotional outlet other than my child, that didn't make me unfit to be a mother.

Objection!

Mrs. Kramer, how can you consider yourself a fit mother when you have been a failure at virtually every relationship you have undertaken as an adult?

So do I.

Now then, Mr. O'Connor, how long did Ted Kramer work for you?

Mis-ter Kramer, it's...  ...almost four now.  It's the Friday before Christmas.  Nobody is going to want to--

Did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way?

A heavy drinker?

I don't recall.

I don't recall.

I consider it less my failure than his.

Ted, I can't...I tried...I really tried but...I just can't hack it anymore...

I am not!  I'm a terrible mother! I'm an awful mother.  I yell at him all the time.  I have no patience.  No...No.  He's better off without me.  Ted, I've got to go...I've got to go.

Hello, Ted.  You look well.

I can't help but feel somehow... it's my fault.  I keep thinking I could've done something-- stopped it...

Watching my son...Ted, I've been living in New York for the past two months.

Ted, listen to me...You and I, we had a really crappy marriage--  Look, don't get so defensive, okay?  It was probably as much my fault as it was yours... Anyway when I left I was really screwed up--

Joanna, go be a mother.  Get married, have kids.  Don't get married, have kids.  Do whatever you want.  I don't give a damn. Just leave me out of it--and leave my baby out of it.

Okay...I think I'll go talk to my son now.  How do I look?

Jesus Christ.  That's a real blockbuster.  I always figured you guys had it made.

Ted, this may sound a little rough, but we've just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency, right? And now it's up to us--that's you and me --to deliver the goods.  Ted, you're my main man, and if I can't depend on you a hundred and ten percent, twenty-four hours a day, because you're worried about a kid with a runny nose--

O'Connor's out to get you.  He's going to take the Fire and Ice account away from you.

You dope.  O'Connor doesn't give a damn about Billy.  All he wants is somebody that'll hang around with him every night so he won't have to go home.

And?

Mr. O'Connor called.  There's a meeting with the Revlon people in the board room and you're fifteen minutes late.

Look, she walked out on her own child, right?  That's desertion, right? Mr. Shaunessy, I'm telling you it's an open and shut case.

Look, Ted, I don't honestly think she would go to the trouble of suing you for custody of the child if she was planning on kidnapping him.

Jesus Christ.  Did you have to be so rough on her?

Mr. Kramer, would you tell the court exactly why you want to retain custody of your child.

Oh, Christ!

Oh, no..

What if I fight it?

I'll take my chances.

Good Christ, Joanna, just get the hell out of my life.

You ever see her talk to the walls?

Your boy is very lucky, Mr. Kramer.  One inch over and it would have caught the eye.

Mr. Kramer, there's--

Yeah, she said it wasn't any use talking anymore.

Hostile?  Me?  Thelma, I'm not hostile.  I am anything but hostile.  But if you want to know what I am.  I'll tell you what I am. What I am is, I am hurt.  I am very hurt.  And I just want to know one thing, okay?  Just one thing ...Why?  That's all I want to know...Why?

Things? What kind of things?

How many onions does it say to use?

Ted.

Please go away, Thel...I...I just have to be by myself for a little while...

Where are you from?

Mama, my story.

And that day, your father got better. He named you Lhamo. "The Protector."

I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness.

How much tea do you drink, Prime Minister?

Do you have plans to return soon, Dalai Lama?

Did you receive the letter?

With much bloodshed.

Yes.

Holiness?

Your Prime Ministers, support the proposal that you return to Lhasa. On the opposite hand, some officials urge you not to return. They believe you should leave now, for India.

I will be back in a few days.

The Four Noble Truths, as taught by the Lord Sakyamuni Buddha are: The Truth of Suffering The Truth of the Cause of Suffering, The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering, the Truth of the Way which leads to the cessation of Suffering.

True suffering arises from contaminated actions and afflictions. Birth, illness, grief, old age, poverty, pain, death -- these are surferings.

You can't do anything real until you are Dalai Lama.

How big is Tibet's army?

Is that big?

Britain chooses not to.

Did you ever doubt it?

The crowd will not disperse until you give your assurance that you will not attend the Chinese festivities. Many who have been invited to dine with the Chinese do not return home.

Please, come in, so cold.

This little brother was terribly sweet. When he died, my mother was so sad. A lama said to her, before the little brother was laid out for burial, take a bit of butter and rub a spot on his skin. He will come back to you, you will see. So, my mother did this, and a few years later, a new boy was born.

I have more men.

Things change, Kundun.

I want to go down there.

Why is this? What is happening? Tell me!

Don't eat all those sweets. You'll get sick.

Mrs. Bickerman, the reason we're up here... a man was fatally attacked yesterday by some animal in this lake.  Do you know how your husband died?

I haven't broken any laws.

Ma'am.  Your husband, Bernie.  You didn't, by any chance, lead him to the lake blindfolded?

I do <u>not</u> like you.

What are <u>you</u> doing?!

I'm laying a spring trap!

I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck.

Asia?  How... how could he get here?

Gee, that would really disappoint me.

No!

This time, <u>I'm</u> gonna kick your ass.

Let's not overlook he didn't eat me, maybe--

No way.

Keep enough tension to hold him up, Hector, we don't know if he can swim.

The more he thrashes, the better.

Where?  Where?

<u>No</u>.  Look.  He's got nothing left.

Such the flirt.

<u>Did</u> you want to be killed by it?

Didn't even <u>sound</u> good?

I'm okay.

Did you make anything of the tooth?

Excuse me.  One other thing, it's a <u>small</u> point, but... I have a thing about being humored, and I'm feeling humored, more by <u>him</u>, but you seemed quick to join in.

It really is beautiful, isn't it?

Baby crocs?

If one could be out there... why does Fish And Game tell me it's impossible?

Whatever's out there <u>did</u> flip over a canoe--

You flew up here because your boss--

They respond pretty quick.  I'll wait till you get down before I turn it on.

No.  U.S. Wildlife is on their way.

Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.

You know they say the brain confuses fear for passion.

I didn't say it like that.

I was trying to pay you a compliment, I was guising it as science 'cause I know you're comfortable in that arena. Science.

I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?

Sorry.

Who taught you be be a nurse?

No thanks.

You're having the best time of your life, aren't you?

That's why you're here.  To get in the middle of something?

Calm down.

We might as well pack.

Watch out!!

We gotta get to Hector!!

No.

You think?

We set?

Are they feeding?

Hank.  The little cannon you brought, get it.  Guard the shoreline.  Otherwise, we're done. We made the I.D., our job is finished.

What?

We don't mean to invade your privacy but... was he ill, was he sick?

They don't believe her.

Was that like a homo-sexual remark?

Hi.  Listen.  Could I steal you a second?

That's not what you came to say.

Kevin, as long as we...  What was that last part?

This was Myra's idea, wasn't it? Get me out of the office for a few days, until--

<u>You</u>?

Myra.

You missed Fourth Amendment law. Unlawful seizure, real juicy stuff. Where were you all afternoon?

Boy, is that smart...

"- every day."

Get your field gear, take stuff for overnight. You're goin' with Crawford.

Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -

Dr. Chilton - if Lecter feels you're his enemy - as you've said - then maybe I'll have more luck by myself. What do you think?

Do you need a police escort, Starling? Or do you think you can find the airport by yourself?

Mr. Yow, if this door should fall down -ha ha! - or anything else - would you be kind enough to call this number? It's our Baltimore field office. They know you're here with me... Do you understand?

Excuse me, but I really do need to talk to you. This was Mrs. Lippman's house. Did you know her?

I'm investigating the death of Fredrica Bimmel. Who are you, please?

Are they close to catching somebody, do you think?

The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him, all afternoon, and Miggs crying. They found him at bed check. He'd swallowed his own tongue... Chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit, and he's trying to blame it on you. I told the little prick your conduct was flawless.  Starling...?

Are you finished?

I don't know. I didn't see those on any of the other girls...

When I told that sheriff we shouldn't talk in front of a woman, that really burned you, didn't it?  That was just smoke, Starling, I had to get rid of him. You did well in there.

When we get back, I want you to run that bug by the Smithsonian, see if they can identify it. Maybe it's got some limited range, or it only breeds at certain times of year... You found it, Starling, you deserve the credit.

The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but -

If we act too anxious, he'll make us wait. He'll let the Senator keep hoping, day after day, until Catherine finally washes up. That'd be the most fun of all.

Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter?

That's why they're all so big - because he needs a lot of skin! He keeps them alive to starve them awhile - to loosen their skin, so that -

Take a bow. Customs had some paper on his alias. They stopped a carton two years ago at LAX - live caterpillars from Surinam. The addressee was "John Grant." Calumet Power & Light's given us two possible residences under that alias. We're hitting one, Chicago SWAT's taking the other.

Is that a pretty good job, FBI agent?

Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved. If -

I'll tell you if you'll look at this form.  It started as a bad joke in Kansas City Homicide. They said... this one likes to skin his humps.

Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?

Who can say...? Best thing for him, really. His therapy was going nowhere.

Ahhh... Why?

Do you have something you use, when you need to get up your courage? Memories, tableaux... scenes from your early life?

A moth... How did you predict that?

The death of my father.

No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old.

Two months.

Dr. Lecter, you find out everything. You couldn't have talked with this "William Rubin", even once, and come out knowing so little about him... You made him up, didn't you?

I heard a strange sound...

They were slaughtering the spring lambs?

But you could. You did.

You still wake up sometimes, don't you? Wake up in the dark, with the lambs screaming?

Thank you, Clarice.

Starling.

Your lambs are still for now, Clarice, but not forever... You'll have to earn it again and again, this blessed silence. Because it's the plight that drives you, and the plight will never end.

Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson. Very humorous. You like the truth? Try this.  He kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off. We don't want him to do that anymore. If you don't help me, just as fast as you can, then the Justice Department is going to ask publicly for a court order, We'll ask twice a day, just in time for the morning and evening news. And each one of our press conferences will focus on Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, and how we're still hoping for his cooperation. And every time there's any news on the case - when Catherine Martin floats, when the next one floats, and the next one - why, we'll just issue another press release about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks.

Better known to his friends as the Death's-head Moth...

The men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake, build fires and provide every comfort you desire, Alice...

Your "father"?

My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend Wheelock's school when I was ten. So we would know both worlds... though we were told only bother learning readin' & arithmetic from yours.

Much further?

Mr Poe?

Webb's reinforcements will arrive or not.  If they do not arrive, the fort will fall. If that happens, stay close to your father.  The French will protect the officer class among the English.

You do not know what you are saying!

One called Magua arrived.

What?!

Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on her before today.

Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?

I ain't your "scout". And I am in no damn militia.

How long?

So the Huron are the servants of the French?  To do what the French are shamed to do?

Magua would use the ways of Les Francais and the Yengeese...

Yes, Mr. Poe? So?

You will take command of the 62nd Regiment of Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward.

Yes, sir.

Not with enough certainty to outweigh British interests in this fort.

I have lived to see two things I never expected.  An Englishman afraid to support a friend. And a Frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage.

Right - about face! March! First rank present!

We are not forgettin' Webb's promise!

Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!

Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.

Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation.

Honor that is freely accorded to courage, may be refused obstinacy... These hills afford to us every opportunity to reconnoiter your works and I am possibly as well acquainted with your weak condition as you are yourselves.  Is Webb really en route and Montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before British reinforcements arrive?

Their arms?

Not exactly a big ocean country.

Some say that's why we're basically hairless, for less water resistance, faster swimming speeds...

DeJesus!  A readout!

Doc eat already?

I've been looking at the duty roster...at the shack hours outstanding...

That's why there's a dead one on the ship.  It ran out of blood.

That's great.  Now let's move 35 degrees southwest.

That was a loud one wasn't it?

Shut up, all of you.

Thank you, Martin.

Well, according to Maritime law, you, as commander of the Shack have the authority to dispose of the body.  However, the company doesn't want you to do that.

Beck, trust me.  If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.

But it's a delay!  How long? A day?  Two days?!

Forty-eight hours!

Personal effects...

If he had his blinkers on--

What the?...

You read Russian?

What's going on?

Hey, Cobb...Man, why don't you take off your shirt and pants, man?  You should do that wearing what you're going to wear at the beach.

You guys are crazy.  What the hell you play that stupid game for?

Bad as he is there's no way we can make our quota with- out his sad self out there. You just can't do it.

Typhoon?!

We've got to get him to the infirmary.

I'm going to try to remove it.

What is it?

No...he's really sick.  I heard him last night.  The company will take that into consideration...

What is it?

What is it?

The shack...

Are you sure you saw something?

It saw us!

My pocket.  Check my pocket, will ya, honey?

Bitch!  Look what you did!

I'll kill him!

So how long do you have to wait 'till you see a return?

A what?

I wanted to talk to you about that.

Scarface, I have watched Scarface. You want to know how to do a drug deal, you watch Scarface!

He'll care all right. That was going to be his money. Whether he cares about us is different. Pass your phone.

What's that?

I thought you said no staff, Bazza!

It's about time you give my young friends a visit, Chris. Tomorrow is the day and mum seems to be the word, and I can't have that now, can I, Chris?

The boys had 'em. I know you like these things; wondered if you wanted them?

They were going to pay, then?

Mind your language in front of my boy.

You all right back there, mate?

How long has he been in there, son?

It's not him, Dad.

Is that you, Dean?

Not likely I am afraid; I don't think I'll be seeing them again.

We gotta get those guns.

And all your friends, there's a good lad.

And look what happened to that.

You what? What are you on about?

There's nothing in it!

Who's this fat man, then?

I dunno, but they look nice. I rather like ' em.

Tom, this is our case.

You must be Eddy. JD's son.

That is quite a raise, one hundred and fifty on my hundred.

That's if I want to see you.

Unless you are going to accept twenty quid.

I thought you were going to leave me out there all day.

My van is half full.

What have you come as?

Oh, you assume, do ya? What do they say about assumption being the brother of all fuck-ups?

Where did you get those from, a museum?

This guy Rory Breaker can afford to do the deal at the price we are selling. It's not worth him giving us trouble; he knows we would be a pain in the arse, and who wants a pain in the arse?

You would take a pain ín the arse full stop.

There's six black cocks sitting on the side of the road. How many beaks have they got between them?

You went out six hours ago to buy a money counter and you come back carrying two bags of fertilizer. Alarm bells are ringing, Willy.

Joanie Orozco's telling the whole school she's like desperately in love with Santo Guerra.

I don't know what the big deal is.

I'm only going to have you for two more years. If you decide not to go on to college--

How do you think you're going to make a living?

That isn't true.

And what did she do?

With your attitude, Private, I'm surprised you want to stay in the service.

So you knew this young man before?

Out of the Army?

Did you know he was going to be there last night?

We're not running a dating service here.

Report to Dr. Innis at the clinic.

You and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals. Put it in gear.

That the word on our boy?

Charley Wade.

You got a cause of death?

What's that for?

Best part of the job.

It wasn't just you, Bunny.

This boy from West Side, plays tackle both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. You imagine having that much weight on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard to breathe. Hard to swallow.

"I only got my little girl now," he says, "she's my lifeline." Then he tells me I can't be in the box anymore if I can't control myself. Sonofabitch don't even watch the damn game, just sits there drinking with his bidness friends, look up at the TV now and then. I do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people.

You've been in this house for a while?

Where'd he get all this?

Uncle Al--

I'm a colonel.

It's a small post and they're phasing it out in two years, but I moved up in rank and--well, a command is a command.

My mother said he never asked about--

He was part of the Seminole Nation, got pushed down into the Everglades in pioneer days. African people who run off from the slaveholders hooked up with them, married up, had children. When the Spanish give up Florida, the U.S.Army come down to move all them Indian peoples off to Oklahoma--

He's a pretty tough old man, huh?

So I'm part-Indian?

Recycling, right? We invented that. The government doesn't have to tell people to do it.

Right.

You finding lots of cactus and shit?

Never thought I'd see the day a buddy of mine was dating a woman with three up and three down on her shoulder.

You going to get married?

Mikey--

But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.

They stopped training infantry there in the late '50s. It was just a playground for the jackrabbits till they gave it to the county last year.

I've got the forensics fella coming down from the Rangers. No way to know how old the body is without some lab work.

Treasure hunter?

There's not that much down here, Colonel. Big O's is the only place in the county that our African American soldiers are uhm--that they feel comfortable in.

Black Seminoles?

Your boys out there cooped up together, need somewhere they can let the steam out. If they're Black, there's not but one place in this town they feel welcome. Been that way since before you were born.

Over the years, this is the one place that's always been there. I loan a little money out, settle some arguments. Got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night. There's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the Mexicans hire each other. There's the Holiness Church and there's Big O's place.

Hola, amgio. Problemas de llanta? [Hey, friend. Tire problems?]

Not much, jefe. Some watermelons.

I haven't seen anybody doing that.

Como se llama? [What's your name?]

Es muy lindo, su coche--

In English, Enrique. We're in the United States--

No! No puede hacer esto--[You can't do that--]

This girl is a friend of yours?

This girl has a child?

Rapidamente! Everybody in the world is going to see!

"Fishbait," says Buddy, in that quiet way of his, "What you know about them tires that went missing from markets?" Fishbait thinks for a minute, then he lifts up a loose board from the porch floor and calls down into it, "C'mon out, Pooter, they caught us!"

Big day coming up--I wish we'd have thought of it while he was still living. But he went so unexpected.

Tell that one, Hollis--

Historic occasion, isn't it?

Which is why we need to talk to you about the new jail--just so we're all on the same page.

That so?

Oh--he come to an accommodation. Money doesn't always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning.

Charley Wade.

I got an idea what happened.

You lived in the man's house what-- seventeen, eighteen years? And you didn't get to know him any better than that?

He agreed it wasn't exactly news--

I don't think you can take it personally--

Could of been. That was white people's business.

What about it?

I'm not open. We were just talking.

She finally got in--

You got in late last night.

Can I get this?

Just 'cause you went to Catholic school and wore a uniform.

Something wrong?

I was on the playground with all the other kids, but I thought he was only looking at me. I was afraid he was going to arrest me--he had those eyes, you know--

It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.

So what are we gonna do about this?

It isn't. Not by a long shot. He holds her and they lie silently for a moment--

Sam? I--the Committee--you know Jorge and H.L. and all--they asked me--

Yeah.

Excellent performance, my friend. The judge was very impressed.

How am I gonna sell things if nobody comes by? This stretch of road runs between Nowheres and Nothin' Much.

Buffalo chips. Fella in Santa Fe told me he sells these as fast as the buffalo can squeeze 'em out.

If he hadn't found that Deputy job, I believe Buddy might've gone down the other path, got into some serious trouble. Settled him right down. That and your mother. 'Course he had that other one later.

I know you?

One of Cleroe Payne's boys?

I sent your Daddy to the farm once.

That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew.

How'd you spell that again?

Who did this?

I don't want him getting in the way.

Don't.

I'll tell you.

I didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  I had to teach myself.  And that took time.

If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not.

Please... I wasn't there... Ask Pimm.

I want you to help me help my husband.  I know he's in some kind of trouble.  And it's something to do with the man you saw murdered.

He's a secretive man.

You don't believe me.

Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?

I didn't marry him for love, Mr. D'Amour.  Tonight?

How did it go today?

Just curious.  Back to business.  Ever heard of a man called Nix?  Dorothea?

Okay.  I'll keep digging.

Flesh is a trap.  That's what he used to say.  Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free.  Why did you come back?

Stuff?

Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours.

It's okay.

Nothing's going to happen to you.

What was that?

Oh God!

No!  No!  No!

...yes?

Don't look.

Sure.

Where the fuck is he?

I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.

Great accent, by the way.  Is it Brooklyn?

What are you, my mother?

It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.

Who is she?

What the fuck are you doing here?

Why'd you come here?

I like to know why things happen.

I want to speak to Dorothea.

Leave her alone --

I want to see Swann face to face.

Him too.

Don't bother.

She has no real grip on reality.

You need an ambulance.

My God.

I'm in from New York.  I came to see Swann.

He knew Swann way back.  He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit.

People are pretty cagey.  Who do you know?

Look, Ma, no wires.

So Nix won't come looking for her?

They got here before us.

Nobody's better off this wav!

Jesus... what the hell's going on in there?

One question.

You don't think I've got it to give?

Swann?  What are you doing?

Because you've got nothing else to live for.

Ok.

Try twenty-five.

I'm thinking about it.

Hi again, how's it going?

Oh, good. Do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here?

Do you remember when we met at the bar? ...You were wearing a tuxedo.

Why do they switch the r's and l's here?

Oh.  Well... they were dancing on the couch with that weird English guy who kept talking about hanging out with the Sex Pistols on Kings Road...

I'm stuck. Does it get easier.

Yeah? But look at you.

Why do you have to be with your opposite, why cant similar people be together?

Four.

You think so?

You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan after 2 o'clock. Did you know that?

Well, I guess she's more around your age...  You guys could talk about things in common, like growing up in the fifties.

I'm sorry.

I'm going to miss you.

Why can't it last?

Charlotte?

Mr. Harris?

Lydia?

Lydia, I went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it.

Yeah, its really different here.

Hello?

I guess she's busy.

Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't forget.

How do you say "hospital" in Japanese?

I gotta go meet Kelly for a drink downstairs. She wants to talk about some photo thing.

You smell weird.

Hair stuff?

Oh, the record company sent these...

Yeah, I know you have to work the whole time, I'll probably have more fun here. I'll call Charlie and those guys.

You never said anything to me...

I can't believe it's already starting to get dark so early.

I'm still shaking.

I'm just temporarily off my game.

Honey, you're exhausted.  Do you want to lie down for a little while?

She's been stalking you, Peter.

Quiet.  Real quiet...

He asked to go home early.  He said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do.

I can take care of myself.

Father Jeremy and Deacon John Townsend of St. Ursula's, and our associate, Maya Larkin.  Secular assistants are permitted if regarded as qualified.  Maya is eminently qualified.

I don't mean to belittle you, but we've been through this before.  Satan is not what you think he is.  Satan is not some creature.

I've had it.  Townsend's dead.  The police are calling and now I see you having a scene in front of the children. I'm sorry, Maya, you've been with us for many years, but effective immediately, I'm rescinding your right to live at the church.

You lied to me my whole life. Everything you said, everything you did.

What do you mean "don't worry?"

So...we won?

We won because Christ...triumphed over Satan?

I took one of those home pregnancy tests, but I don't want to tell him. I'm RH negative.  My blood type is negative...  If he's RH positive, I'll have to terminate.

Well I know he's come here before.

Oh my God!

A narcissist doesn't admit it.  It's the extreme of self-denial.

Well, then it all seems to be working out for you.  Listen, Ms...?

And this is evil?  The guy had an aneurysm and now he's in a coma.

Trick him.

You should think about getting professional help.

Yes, I know.

Hang on, get it up, go on, higher.

Close call.  For the first time in a long time, it's really hitting me. Life's tenuous.

What about after?

That's his, I don't know, his 'grounding' phrase for me, "together, no matter what."

I'd appreciate it if you'd put that back.

Mr. Kelson, here's the stuff you wanted on pathological narcissism.

Good of you to stop by.

As a part of today's story on the trial of mass murderer George Viznick, we welcome Peter Kelson, author of the current best-seller, VICIOUS INTENT. Thank you for joining us, Peter.

Peter, you're now writing a book about the Viznick case.  You seem to be making a career of studying sensational murderers.  I have to ask, how does it make you feel when you sit in courtrooms day after day, face to face with alleged killers?

It's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil, the less evil it becomes.

Meaning, Viznick's a man who answers to no one.  Not even God.

Would you sign it for me?

So, Viznick's got a meet with his lawyer in the ayem.

Seems George isn't making too many friends in lockup.

He could see me.

Thanks for handling this.

Thanks again for everything.

You really should be a caterer or something like you used to say.

I'm angry because I want a mother, not Martha Stewart.

She needs to stop running around like a little boy.

Which one for tomorrow?

What?

Can I take your coat?

Quincy, word has it you might make the jump the NBA.

Hello.

So how long is this trip?

Nah.

I don't know sometimes.

I found you someone.

You do.

I don't know how to walk in heels.

Monica, I think her point is...maybe it's time to start thinking about other things besides basketball.

You only have one game left and you haven't been recruited.  Munchkin, I wanted it as bad as you did, but we have to face reality.

What's up with that?

I know.

I'm gonna love winning this championship in your house.

Yeah, four years ago.  They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people.  I'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock.  Then the whack club I'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed.  So they fire me.

You ever think about going back?

One, up.

I never knew a girl that could play.

I don't know.  A lot.

You do act different.

Well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause I run this street.

I don't like flowers.

So?

What's that?

And?

Didn't know you cared so much.

When'd you get this?

You finish the reading for E-con?

I can't be nice to a fan?

It's okay, little baby.

That was so weak.

I...can't.

You know what, I'm just gonna crash.

Can we talk?

Least you got your priorities straight.

Never had to.

You don't think so?

So...I guess I'll see you around.

What are the doctors saying?

I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.

Funny.  I never did.

Tried calling you a couple times.

Actually, I don't...

I'm tired of playing overseas.  Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.

Who's this guy I always see her around?

Strong enough to get you down the aisle?

Like what?

It doesn't matter, alright.  Just leave it alone.

You asked me what was missing.

We haven't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this?

I'll play you.

One game.  One-on-one.

There's so many I just can't keep track.

Give it yourself.

Zeke.

I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.

The doctor'll be back in a minute.

What?

I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught.  They see you, they see dollar signs.

Quincy, please...

Guess I should have been telling your father.

Besides, the sooner you go pro, the sooner you'll have to deal with the mess I'm dealing with.

Some girl that's been hanging on at every party.  now I'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy.  Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be the one who told you.

Sorry.

So what are you gonna do?

Hello?

Well I'm not sure why you're calling me.

My mother had breast cancer.

Oh, she's fine.

Thank you, Chad, and good luck to you and your mother --

Don't sit down.

Wilson.

I didn't realize it was that loud.

I like iced coffee, generally, but a day like this, rain and what not, I enjoy a warm cup --

I don't know how fresh it's gonna be --

Bye, bye, Claudia.

I'm sorry, Claudia.

Please, yes.

It's my favorite place --

Great, bye.

What I just said...y'know, people afraid to say things....no guts to say the things that they...that are real or something...

Well.

Yeah, of course.

-- no, like what, what do you mean?

Say what you want and you'll see --

Just say no.

-- you the resident here?

What's your name?

Where's the news department at this studio?

I'm wondering about the weather department. I'm wonderin' wether or not the weather people use outside meteorlogical services or if they have in-house instruments?

Richard, shut it and keep it down.

DADDY! DAD! DAD WHAT THE HELL IS GOIN' ON?

DADDY, FUCK, DADDY, DON'T GET MAD AT ME. DON'T GET MAD AT ME --  JUST GIMME YOUR MONEY.

Nope.  So what'd they find out in there?

Ok. Listen. You: c'mere.

Just throw some money around. Money, money, money.

Is it real love?

I have love.

What?  What does that mean?

You talk in rhymes and riddles and ra...rub-adub --- but that doesn't mean anything to me, see....see...see I used to be smart....I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith. I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the tv --

That's right.

It was the lovely Samuel Johnson who also spoke of a fella "Who was not only dull but a cause of dullness in others."

Picky, picky.

This sounds Sad as a Weeping Willow.

You see?

You mind your own bussines.

...please...

He has Phil right now.

I need to sit down.

...no...no goddamn use.  I have a son, y'know?

She's a good girl.  She's a little nuts, but she's a good girl I think. She's a little daffy.

....I dunn...o....maybe ten...five, fuck, fuck....that's another thing that goes --

"yeah."  the fuck do you know?

Jack.

You wanna call him on the phone? We can call him, I can dial the phone if you can remember the number --

...Lily...?

Hello?

Yeah.  You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here.

-- that's right, that's right, and what I'M saying, that none of my competitors can say is this:  That there is no need for insight or understanding.  Things of the past! Gone, Over, Done. Do you realize how fucking miraculous this is? How fucking razor sharp and cutting edge and ahead of it's time this concept is?  I'm talking about eliminating <u>insight</u> and <u>understanding</u> as human values.  GOD DAMN I'M GOOD.  There is no need for INSIGHT.  There is no need for UNDERSTANDING.  I have found a way to take <u>any</u> subjective human experience -- in other words -- all the terrible shit or all the great shit that you've had happen to you in your life -- and quickly and easily transform it in the unconscious mind through the subtle and cunning use of language.  The "listener-patient"  settles into a very light, very delicate, conversationally induced state: NOT A TRANCE, mind you, but a STATE. A state that is brand new.  The System's state. What did I do?  I REALIZED that concept and put it into practical "get my dick hard and fuck it" use. I'm gonna build a state for the seducer and the seducee to live, vote, breath, pay takes and party 'till dawn.  I'm gonna teach methods of language that will help anyone get a piece of ass, tit and tail --

-- just to clarify --

Where are you from originally?

the valley?

And you ended up at UC Berkely --

Hello.  Frank.  Frank TJ Mackey.

Yeah. I was trying to get in touch with you.  We got dissconnected.

She's not here, she went out. I'm sorry.  This is all just so, I don't know what, what to do -- your Dad asked me to try and track you down. To get you and I did, I called the number -- Do you wanna come in?

How long...you think?

He's in here --?

It's interesting.

Can you stand...back...maybe, I mean... just a little bit...in the room is ok, but back from us a little...

There's no disturbance.

You don't tell me, I know my rights, just come right in, you can't --

I don't have to answer your questions.

You're here.

No.  I said that.

I preffer to stand.

You just woke up.  And what'd you have a party last night, the way this place looks?

Ok. Marcie. Starting now I want you to have a new attitude with me.  The more you play games, the more suspicious I'm gonna become that you've been up to something.

Bad and illegal behavior. That's what I mean. Ok?  Mischief.  Now have you been doin' some drugs today?

Marcie - quiet down! Now if anyone is in the closet, come out now --

...you know...

Will you say my name?

What happend to you?

We're on the air in twenty minutes, Jimmy.

I don't mean to cry, I'm sorry.

How you doing?

Did you tell her?

No.  No.

I don't.

She thinks terrible things that somehow got in her head...that I might have done something.  She said that to me last time...when it was...ten years ago she walked out the door, "You touched me wrong..." "I know that." Some crazy thought in her, in her head...

...Jimmy...

No.

Hello?

No, I'm just a friend.  What are you doing here, I mean...you know Claudia?

Do you have an agent, Stanley?

Commercials, a sitcom, an MOW or something.

Are you on drugs right now?

Not exactly, Linda. I'm not sure where you're going with this --

This is not any fucking medication talking, this isn't -- I don't know. I don't know -- Can you give me nothing? You have power of attorney, can you see him, can you, in this final fucking moment, go see him and make sure --- change the fucking will -- I don't want any money, I couldn't live with myself, this thing I've done -- I've fucking done so many bad things -- I fucked around.  I fucked around on him, I fucking cheated on him, Alan. You're his lawyer, our laywer, THERE, I'm his wife, we are married. I broke the conract of marriage, I fucking cheated on him, many times over, I sucked other men's cocks and fuck - fuck - fuck - ....fuck.... Other Things I've Done..

I can't.

Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.

listen...listen to me now, Phil: I'm sorry, sorry I slapped your face. ...because I don't know what I'm doing... ...I don't know how to do this, y'know? You understand?  y'know?  I...I'm...I do things and I fuck up and I fucked up....forgive me, ok? Can you just...

You been on Prozac long?  Dexadrine?

Phone number.

Partridge?

Mmm.Hmmm.

yeah, I said.  Is that it?

I got an audition, I won't make it here 'till two, c'mon, I'll see you later. Love you.

C'mon, man.

You ready to keep winning?

Go to it, handsome.

What's the problem, what's the problem here?

Why didn't you answer those questions?

...oh Jesus, what the fuck...?

Are we gonna keep going with this game?

I think that you have to be nicer to me.

...what...?

M'lady...?

What is it, mother?

What had you to do with this, Mother?

Your birthday celebration, your Majesty?

The Prison of Belle Sur.

Who is he, Aramis?

Then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son.  What gives you the right to judge me, to play God with the lives of others?  Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?!

Physical resemblance is but one small thing!  Louis has an arrogance, a manner --

Phillippe -- he's very bright, he's perceptive, but he is in such turmoil --

Hang himself?!

Poor Phillippe!

Aramis, this will never --

I cannot betray Louis.  I will defend him with my life.

Pull them back!

D'Artagnan... Those are young Musketeers down there.  They have been weaned on our legends.  They revere us -- it is an advantage. Why don't we charge them?

Aramis... is this the way to hell?

D'Artagnan watches everything.  We have to be lucky.

D'Artagnan, unready?

"Phillippe has been removed to the Bastille, to the lower dungeon.  At midnight tonight I will order the guard changed, and will delay the replacements for ten minutes.  That should give you ample time.  Never have I needed more to say:  One for all, and all for one.  D'Artagnan."

That must be Raoul!  Raoul!  Look, d'Artagnan's come to visit...! What's wrong?  You look awful!

Michelle cannot possibly accept!

D'Artagnan!

It's been too long.

I heard your playing.

Where are you going?

What is that?

I've worn this mask so long, I couldn't sleep without it.

I am so sorry!  Forgive me, I --

Are you hungry?

This place... I once lived in a country house.  I had guardians -- an old man and woman.  And tutors. But no friends.  Then when I was twelve, they came and took me to the prison.

The plans for use of the maze were not disclosed to me.

Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that --

That is my desire, and my desire is what should concern you, not the sentiments of some commoner!

You dare criticize my father?!  Or lecture me?!

Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain!

What number did you tear out?

Did they kill him?

I would have said it was impossible, but I believe the excitement of the chase has made you even more beautiful.

... Nothing.

Wait, no!  Do not be ashamed.  The straits of your family need not be permanent.  It is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates, where they may have fine meals, and physicians to look after them.

I don't think you understand. I don't mean shuffling papers in an office, I mean Jim Trudell worked classified assignments, special forces...sabotage...until last year. He was brought up on charges of espionage, but the charges were later dropped, and he sprang the service.

Our agency monitors all threats very carefully, and there's good reason to believe Jim Trudell has the training, the connections, and the experience to present a clear threat to the public if he remains at large.

Alright, we know who we're looking for.  Play it cool until the time is right to make a move.  Let's not pull any gangbusters shit or we'll lose him again.

You mind if I ride with you?

So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.

Let's roll -

If you can trail him to a remote area do it. We all want a piece of him but let's keep our heads and stay within the law - we got people everywhere out here.

Something wrong with you Marvosa?

I tell you one thing Trudell - you'd make a hell of a cop...

I was just having a little fun -

Vice...you think they had something to do with this dead hooker?

Speak of the devil.

So where are you from?

Where up north?

Why did you set me up?

Look what are you anyway? Some kind of spy?

What?

Tubbs, it's me.

Just what did you get yourself into, Jimmy?

Jesus, man...

Operator, I'd like to make a collect call - 213-467-0972...

OK...county tax records...they're saying 1490 Breckinridge is owned by... an Atlantic Trust Corporation...they have a P.O. box in D.C.

OK...Marvosa makes calls to this fax number overseas.  And that's Switzerland's country code.

It was you who did the asking.

I wouldn't presume to try.

I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in...

Crawford has a proposition. I don't think it's a good idea.

The main thing is: how was Lecktor to reply.

They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student.  He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.

How long do I have?

This is Chester here. Who am I talking to?

You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?

How much do you know?

Why not?

He is good. Bur not as good as Price.

Atlanta and Birmingham can run the thumb print against known sex offenders. Five will get you ten they don't come up with an identification. Jimmie may in the Finder program... if he's ever been printed and in his Index.

Don't expect too much from me, Jack, all right?  We'll get him one way or the other.

We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...  If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.

Run it.

Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Peoria, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Toledo and Detroit.

It's not over yet.

What it's going to say on the Jacobi film can is the same as it says on the Leeds' film can: Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.

It does, doesn't it?

I'll cover the back.

Ms. McClain, I'm Francis Dollarhyde. I came about the low light level infrared film stock.

When do you need it?

I'll probably go back to it someday.

Reba...

No. Reba...?

I'll see you later. All right?

Who is it?

What am I doing here?

Look at the screen. That is William Blake's 'The Great Red Dragon and The Woman Clothed with the Sun.'  Do you see?

Do you see?

Are you a man?

Do you imply that I'm a queer?

You did very well.  I apologize for the crude images.  Next time I'll have film stock that doesn't need lights.

The consensus around here is that the only person who has demonstrated any practical understanding of Dr. Hannibal Lecktor is you, Mr. Graham. Can you tell me anything about him?

Linda King's desk.

Linda doesn't come in nights.

Federal Bureau of Investigation, Tenth and Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C.

3680 DeSoto Highway. Marathon, Florida.

He's right-handed.

He's white and six feet tall. You haven't told me anything yet.

Our people swear he wore surgeons' gloves the whole time. They dusted everything.

He may have a history of biting -- barroom fights or child abuse.

He stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here.

You mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma.  You are open and easy now... It took you a lot of work to get to that...

What the hell can I do?

Molly?

Hello, hotshot!

Kevin's fine. He had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in. The dogs dug them up. Tell me what you're doing.

Blue is cold.

What will you do?

Is Crawford going with you?

You should go to Montana. Stay with Kevin's grandparents. They haven't seen him for a while.  I'll come and get you afterwards...

Hello.

Come home with me.

Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.

They don't want me up there. Every time they look at me I remind them... If they thought about it, they'd want you. Bur all they really want's the boy. And they'll take you.  But they don't want to see me...

Let's forget who said what to whom...

Sure he is. Blond.  Probably Scandinavian, too...

Thanks for the lift.

Meet point's up ahead!

And how is Officer Stuart? The one who was the first to see my basement.

A layman..., layman. Interesting term. So many experts on government grants. And you say you're a 'layman?' But it was you who caught me, wasn't it, Will? Do you know how you did it'

No it's not. Do you know how you did it Will?

Why should I tell you?

You came here to look at me, Will. To get the old scent again, didn't you?

...if he's smart he'll approach from the front, pass, and take you from the back. How well do you hear?

Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'

Hey, I really enjoyed your set.

People love... comedians.

Andy!

Look, I'm sorry.  They're assholes! But we work in a creative business. You can't predict what people are gonna like --

Hi, George!  Good to hear from you!

Oh dear!  George, this is gonna kill Tony. He's waited his whole life for this break.

That means it was a success.  I woke up the audience -- like punk rock!  Here, take this.

So how can I help you...?

I don't care about the money.  I just want the show to deliver.

Tony Clifton.

My hair is coming out.

Really?

B-but... we saw... your neck...

Five.

Hey, I hope you didn't take that stuff I said seriously.  It was just part of the show!  It's like the old days, when a carnival barker would try to rile up the crowd.

Popcorn?

Oh!  Uh, I hope I didn't offend you.

And all this will be for real?

Is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble??

You're NOT DYING!

T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --

Hey Andy, good show.

I'm gonna quit.

Give me the book.

I dunno about this...  What will my mother think?

Look at this!  An evil Russian! Ooo, here's an evil Nazi -- he likes to fight dirty!  Hey, here's an evil Japanese guy!

You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...

This is very difficult for me to say... but -- perhaps it would be best if you didn't attend the retreat.

I don't see any injury to your neck, Mr. Kaufman.

No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.

Gene, you misunderstood!!  You're not getting BOTH of them!  It's physically impossible!

"Burlesque"?

We had a deal!!

I'm worried about Andy.  His stress level is affecting his work.

Yeah, he's just laying low, waitin' for his comeback.  God, listen to this!  "It was morally wrong to take advantage of such an unstable individual..."

Hey, that's good!  We can make that play.  And we'll really drag it out.  You get better, you get worse... you die...

Why is he saying these things?!

He'll be contacting us again.

We'll need a search running.

You don't know.

Smith.  I am Agent Smith.

Lieutenant?

Weird.

Who is it?

I know, I know.  This never happened.  You don't exist.

You ever have the feeling that you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming?

Don't be ridiculous.

You don't, do you?

Goddamn you, Cypher!

Five.  Since I've been here.

Dead.  All dead.

Just get me outta here.

Give me your phone.

Hello?

How?!

No!  It's too far away.

Welcome, Neo.  As you no doubt have guessed, I am Morpheus.

Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place?

When?

Do you know why you didn't make it?

Do you understand, Neo?

No you don't.  Did you see the woman in the red dress?

What?  Are you trying to tell me that I can dodge bullets?

Set down in there.

So is this the same oracle that made the, uh, prophecy?

And she knows what?  Everything?

And she's never wrong.

Tank.

Tank, charge the E.M.P.

You're the Oracle?

Yeah.

Morpheus believes in you, Neo and no one, not you or even me can convince him otherwise.  He believes it so blindly that he's going to sacrifice his life to save yours.

Hello, Neo.

Who is?

Did you go to her?

How much like it?  Was it the same cat?

Is Morpheus alive?

That I would have to make a choice...

Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  There's no way you're going back in!

What?

No, you're not.

Morning.  Did you sleep?

Where is it?

Neo, this is loco.  They've got Morpheus in a military-controlled building.  Even if you somehow got inside, those are agents holding him.  Three of them!  I want Morpheus back, too, but what you are talking about is suicide.

Operator.

Operator.

It's obvious that the girl doesn't want to accompany you, isn't it?

Well, we got $40, and we wanna buy...

Hey hold it!  Gimmie the cash.

See what I mean?  A question please...'Is this what you call living?'

Who's the girl?

Get out of here before this really goes up.

So?

You flew before?

Hey...no more good times like before.  Until you come back.

Waddaya think?

It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you.

You got some mouth!

Don't come any closer!!!

I swear to God Charlie...my arm still hurts from the car accident...that's why I didn't go to work.  I swear it.

I'm sorry Charlie...I didn't mean it.

Well kids...have the bans been announced yet?

You threaten me with my uncle? After what I'm doing for you?

Don't you move!!!

Back so soon.

I was in the basement fixing the pipes.  Would you believe that?

Your Uncle's a good man...I won't stick him.  Either he gets the money or the place and right now he's getting the place.  And tell me why should I care?  I got a partner who's a bum, who doesn't help out...who disappears and leaves me with all the problems.  I should go back to Florida...I don't need this.

Oh great...hey - Winstons?

$500.  He borrowed that because he wanted to pay off his other loans... now, counting the interest...it's almost $3,000.

You're really crazy.

In a little while...I'm gonna have the opportunity of opening my own place...not here...much nicer than this...uptown...sort of nite-club and restaurant and everything.

Ok.  Chinese.  We'll meet on the corner of 6th Avenue and Waverly Place after you finish.

Uncle, how are you feeling?

Take a drink!

Hey, where you been?

Who me? ...No, I don't know, not me...all I know is...

His whole family has problems...his cousin, the girl who lives next door to you...

Her mother and father come to me and ask advice...she wants to leave...get her own apartment...worries them sick...what am I gonna tell them?  Lock her up?

Please take it.

Sure...it's not that...I mean...

Maybe, who knows.

You know...like restaurants, night clubs...

C'mon Charlie...one more day.  I'll call in sick for work.

Teresa?...Yeah, Charlie.  Listen, I'm looking for your cousin.  Yeah, well today's Tuesday, payday.  I haven't seen him all day...no...well, have you got any idea where he is?  I know it's early yet but I'm just getting worried that's all...

Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.

Don't count it...it's all there.

Put it on the little tab so that it balances with the big one.

What'sa matter...forget your registration?

I know what you're going to say but don't say it.  These drinks are all on the tab.  I'm gonna see you this Tuesday payday, I promise.  I give you my word.

Can you spare it?

-- But he does seem very nice.

Dinner?  Again?

Did you speak to the Governor?

Daddy!  Come on, a name.

Just plain 'Joe'?

Have you got a minute?

Fireworks.  Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...

I hate parties --

Now, I'm getting interested.  I want to know more ---

Did you know twenty-six members of your rifle company are coming?

I do it because I love you.  Because everybody I loved you.  Mommy -- wher- ever she is -- Susan, Quince, the people who work for you, everybody who's ever known you.

I haven't been the father to you that --

You know, darling, this is going to be a wonderful party.

What about the Mayor?

Please don't be negative, Drew, we have an acceptance list that would do The White House proud -- The Secretary-General of the UN, the Chairman of the FCC, nine Senators, I don't know how many Congressmen, and at least twelve of the Fortune '500'.

Paillarde of veal.

And that?

Red or white?

We've met before, y'know, that White House function, the President had you on his right and you know where I was?

You don't mean that.  You wouldn't disappoint Daddy --

Drew, you're out of line.

Yes.

It doesn't matter.

Who are we talking about?

In my sleep.

...Tomorrow we sign off -- photo opportunity, you and Big John, it'll lead network news.  Okay so far?

I thought it was great, I thought you and Big John would be like a couple of bulls in a china shop --  Instead it was --

Sorry...um - you - you know it's gone right out of my head --

I was a little abrupt with you this afternoon, Drew.  Forgive me.  I want you to know I value your advice.

What are their feelings?

That's it?

You're talking through your hat. You're offering a deal because you've got no proof.

Never mind Bontecou.  I've got some other merger possibilities up my sleeve, and I'm putting them to see old man.

I don't want to get rich this way -- I'm going to expose you.

This is damn big of Bill, I also think it's smart.

What you then?

She knows how she feel.

Don't bother asking, we already tried.

You're an original, Joe.  A little hard to figure, maybe...

Confused, huh?  About what?

Oh yes, I do.

Because there's nothing we don't know about each other and it's okay. I mean the deeper, darkest secrets -- they don't matter.

Do you think I should wait to tell him 'till after the party?

What are your intentions?  To make little dreams in coffee shops, turn a woman's head, and I don't mind admitting it was turned, I liked it, but ten hours later I feel like a fool.  I don't get it.  You, my father, here in this house, the cof- fee shop, it's making me upset, and I don't like being upset.  Who are you anyway?  And what are you eating?

Goodnight, Joe.

I came to see you.

I mean I appreciate that.

I'm very concerned about the woman you attended to today.

'To bed'?

I just thought I'd drop by, scrounge a little lunch, I was in the neigh- borhood --

Did you like making love to me?

For how long?

I like you in a black tie.

But there's so much to tell you --

'Love will find out the way'?

The 'coffee shop' --

I - uh --

I'm still here.

If there is anything else, don't hesitate --

How long have I got?

...I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine.

Bill --

Yes.

-- What's the deal here?  Are you going to be breathing down my neck right 'til the very end?

Truly - uh - splendid.

Uh-huh.

And more.

Why, at this juncture, are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?

Why did you go to the hospital?

You were just curious?

With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.

Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch.

Uh --

You are?

Those were my words, Bill.

Are you threatening me?

Happy Birthday, Bill.

Yes.

Excuse me?  Could I say something?

When I introduce you, if I say who you are, I don't think anyone will stay for dinner.

I think you know --

'The one' to do what?

What the hell are you talking about?

The 'question' --

But I've got to tell you, if mergers are in the wild, I've got some great prospects I've developed.  I want to talk to you about them next week.

No, anything is possible.  It's up to Joe.

But he does give a shit.  Don't you, Bill?

Come in, Joe -- I want to thank you -- okay, Bill?

...It's not over, 'til it's over.

I hope so.

Well, I wasn't going to say that --

Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.

That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.

Thank God.

Uh - will that hold you, Joe?

Funny, I don't get that feeling. Maybe it's because you found out I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.

That was wonderful.

Where is he?

Susan, I don't think Joe is going to be with us long.

Are you relieved?

But what?

Why?

Yes, I could.  I have an office in the hospital.

I've got to go --

38.

66.

69.

You don't know?

You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them. Don't you remember?

Condition?

Like waking. Like you always just woke up.							 *

Last week. Then I rented you another one On top of this.

You don't have to be that honest, Burt.

I know you said you didn't want any calls...

Why?

Yeah.

You know him?

Have I told you what this man did?				*

What?

His name was Jimmy.

I did exactly what you told me. I went to		   * Dodd and I said that I didn't have				* Jimmy's money, or any drugs, that this Teddy must have taken everything.

Give him some bruises of his own and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.

Why would you do that?

You don't know, do you? You're blissfully ignorant, aren't you?

I'm not.

Don't say another fucking word!

They're not looking for him.

Beer, please.

My boyfriend told me about you.

My name's Leonard.							 *

I don't know. I'm sorry.

I'm not appealing the decision.

Mrs. Jankis, what do you want from me?

I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Francisco and I'm -

This is your car.

Unfinished business. What made you think I wasn't coming back?

It's weird, but if you don't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry. You get sort of shaky but you don't realize you haven't eaten. Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?

Why?

You don't know him?

Prove it.

Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you.

What sort of questions?

How'd you know I was in here?

Envelopes?							    *

How do you know him?

He might have fallen down the stairs, I don't know, I don't know what's going on, I'm confused. I have this memory thing - do I know you?

I don't know. See, I have this condition.

I dunno... your wife surviving the assault... her not believing about your condition... the doubt tearing her up inside.., the insulin -

Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" -

Sammy was a con man. A faker.

I was wrong! That's the whole point! Sammy's wife came to me and -

My wife wasn't diabetic.

You know, when we found your guy and			   * killed him.  That's right, the real John G. Over a			  * year ago. I helped you find him. He's			  * already dead.							 *

Why would I do that?						    *

Your name's Teddy.

What cop?

Bullshit.							*

No.  I was in Namibia...

And...?

Get me Air Support...  We'll be airborne and assault the ambush...

We're not certain...

All I want to know is the where and the when.  Spare me mini moves, progress reports and bullshit.

How many?

My end?

Put your guns on the table...  If we wanted you dead, you would no longer be drawing breath in Miami. We wouldn't have brought you all the way here.

When?

What's "nothing"?

There is one thing you can do for me in recognition of the death- defying risks we took to recover your product...

And why should continuing excellence cost more?

Did Christmas come early this year...?

Good samba dancing...?

What...?

You afraid of violence?

Where we meeting 'em...?

Where'd you go?

Where?

I am asking.  You to me.

It's fucked up.  I'm sorry...

Who are you talking to?

Okay.

Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.

Why?

I think José suspects anybody he doesn't intimidate.  And people, who are good at what they do?  They have egos, too...

I run down the numbers.  Nothing is very negotiable.  Small loads?  We pay three thousand a ki. We pay your fuel costs up front plus ten percent.  The next ten percent on U.S. landfall.

It's all bullshit.  Jesus is out of communication in Fals de Iguazu. José knows that...  Whatever he's going to do, he has to do it fast because he's acting on his own. And he will need a story.

Equipment?

And violence is extra.  And expensive.  So how much weight you looking to move?

Importation value?  At twenty-two thousand a ki...

Beg pardon, ma'am. I'm brand spanking new to this town, come from Houston, Texas, and hoping to get a look at the Statue of Liberty...

Beg pardon, ma'am?

I'm sorry. I thought you were -- never mind -- I've never actually been there, but let me see, you take the Seventh Avenue subway, I think, to the end of the line...

You think I'm lying!

Cut it out. That's cheating, teasing me so I can't think. Just one bitsy Y word and I gonna beat you!

That is one hell of a shirt. I bet you paid a pretty price for it, am I right?

I'm a hustler, hell, didn't you know that?

Hey, listen, how about you take me to mee this Mister O'Diddle bird right now?

Joe -- do me one favor -- this is my place, am I wrong? You know, in my own place my name ain't Ratso. I mean it so happens my name is Enrico Salvatore Rizzo.

The two basic items necessary to sustain life are sunshine and coconut milk. That's a known fact. If I can find the goddam hole the milk squirts out.

Miami Beach is the only place for a real hustler. Florida has more rich chicks per square yard than any resort spot in the world. They lie out in their pagodas and pergolas waiting to grab the first jockstrap that passes.

You ain't got a chance in hell. You need threads and glitter, baby. A front, hey?

Kee-rist, you pretty damn clever for a skimpy little gimp.

Shee-it. Cough yourself inside out, then light a fag, a goddam fag. You make me puke. Where'd you steal it? In the movies?

Tell her, Ratso.

They wrong?

These guys're good drivers.

You get your first palm tree in South Carolina.

What you got me up here for?

You want me to leave?

Am I tickled to find you, boy! Come on in and let's get a look at you. Turn around. Good strong back. You'll need it. So you want help -- take a seat, relax, tell me about yourself. Cowboy, huh?

But I'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys. I'll bet you're lonesome.

Lonesomeness is something you take. You bear? Dammit, you take it and go about your business, that's all.

You got it.

Get lost.

Getchmis olsun

The kids? Why are they...

To what?

Yeah. How's Mom?

Right!  That's what we're shooting for.  Mister Davis and have been in contact with the State Department, but right now relations with the Turks aren't too good, Nixon's upset the hell out of them. Our best bet's... right here.

I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid.

How far?

A cabdriver. He picked me up in the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar.

Just what?

...are you with the Consulate?

Just Erich.

Feeling all right?

New people sometimes get on his nerves.

What they give you?

I want you to know we're going to do everything, in our power to get you out as soon as possible. Believe me.

No... It looks like your going to have a new court.

What time is it?

Oh we... we...

What?

...His money - steal that, you steal his blood... Could you see his face when everything he worked so hard to get got snatched?  If we knew where he hid it.  Anyway, steal from him they'd pick up the whole prison and shake it sideways.  We couldn't hide it anywhere.

Why the suit?

What is it with you man, what the hell is it?

But you fuck with me. You fuck with me all the time. You make crummy tea.  You rip us off on the hash.

Hey, you can't...

Lady...

The blintzes!  "Try the blintzes..."

Go left.  Go left again till you hit the fork... Then right again. You got that?

Excuse me, I'm talking to you.

A mistake.

You gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires.  Think you can handle it?

What do you-?

What are you putting that crap on me for?

He didn't do it!

Which way?

A shame.  You looked great tonight.

You were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, don't forget that.

Okay, meet me out front.  I gotta go. Josh's picking me up in five. see you tonight.

Keep going. We'll tell you when to stop...

I get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids.

...you don't even know what you're looking for.

Why take the chance?  Just let me go down there with you...

Rub it on the windows!

We'll cover ourselves with this. They can mimic us-  we Goddam mimic them!

It worked before...

You go first. I'll be right below you.

You sure you didn't see one of these?

Not a big one.  I mean, it was like a turkey baster.

It bit you.

What do you want to know?

You've been here two days. You're gonna be okay.  My name is Annie Wilkes and I'm--

Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck--  Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming.

You want to read it?

But what?

I can take it, go ahead.

I don't mean to pry, but I've read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials. And I said it can't be true. Paul Sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that.

I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. Boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that?

This farm was getting kind of dreary, what with just the few cows and chickens and me--  But when I got Misery here, everything Changed--she just makes me smile so.

For a while I thought I might go crazy.

You...you dirty bird. She can't be dead. Misery Chastain cannot be dead! How could you?

I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER! And you MURDERED her!

What are you doing on the floor?  It's my fault. If I'd had a proper hospital bed, this never would have happened. Here, let me help you back in.  I know this hurts, but it'll only take a few seconds. There you go. Comfy?

You want me to burn my book?

You want me to burn my book?

I do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year. People say it has something to do with the ozone layer. What do you think?

See, isn't this nice?

Misery's Return?

I guess you don't get bothered by neighbors much.

But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.

Well, it does smudge after all--isn't that fascinating?

Poor dear... Let's get you back in bed and I'll get them for you.

Paul, what you've written just isn't fair.

You can--you have the "gotta"--

I've never had meatloaf this good, what do you do to it?

Paul, my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south.

Now don't fuss, Paul.

Paul, this will be our legacy.

Oh, Paul. I'm dying. Does she wind up with Ian or Windthorne? You have to tell me.

Oh, Paul, this is so romantic. Ian and Windthorne dueling for the right to Misery's hand. Does Ian win? Oh, don't me. It's Windthorne, right?

We actually got a phone call. Busy morning.

Virginia, when you're in this car, you're not my wife, you're my deputy.

You really think Sheldon's out there?

It was an old car--those dents could have been there forever.

That thing.  Here it is. Right where it's supposed to be.

I'm a literary agent, and I feel like a fool calling you, but I think one of my clients, Paul Sheldon, might be in some kind of trouble.

I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now.

Has she been buying any odd things lately?

Newspapers?

When I wrote my first book, I used to carry it around in this while I was looking for a publisher. That was a good book, Marcia. I was a writer then.

And my contacts at Time and Newsweek tell me they're both raves. And don't laugh--for the first time, I think you've got a shot at some prizes.

I like it. Remember how you once said I live my whole life as if I'm in danger of being found out? Well, I believe I've managed to get that guy down on paper.  Don't think I'm completely nuts, but in some way, Annie Wilkes, that whole experience, helped me.

Not everything.  Why do you think she's really here?

How grateful?

You won.

What made you pick <i>that</i> nag?  She'd never won a bloody thing.

Feel like pleading for your life?

Ambrose is meeting some bloke in the bar. Big bloke, ginger hair. They're into something.

That's it?  That's it? That's it?

I wouldn't do that.

Under the circumstances I think we would recommend re-setting the senors to respond to a lighter load.  How do you feel about forty kilos, Miss Hall?

I need your help and I thin you can use mine.

They've got a book for this?

The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth.  He'd lie about his favorite color.  But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard.  All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.

So where did I got right?

There's nearly 2 million in London.

Go and insinuate yourself back into Sean's life.

So would I.  But it's not mine to give.

Much.

He's got you on Qantas flight 2735.  It's going to be delayed.

Just like old times?

Have you met them?

I want <i>you out of there.</i>

Nyah, you've done more than enough.  Even the best of snake charmers get bit.

Ethan, you know what frightens me most when I'm with him?..the thought of never seeing you..how are we getting out of here?

What?  You told me to get out of here.  I thought you were here to collect me.  I was so relieved.

What did you think you were doing!

No.

Sorry I didn't let you know where I was.

Like what?

Right now only Ambrose knows that.

I don't think I can get her to do it.

Sorry, Ethan.  I don't quite know where to begin.  Any suggestions?

Why not?  You've done just about everything else on this operation.

No, I don't.  But in this case -

They're ready and waiting.  You'll soon be with old friends.

..it seems we have a problem, Dmitri.

..I'm fine..and you?

It's the transponder.

Sorry, that it a Biocyte facility, their storage structure..

Now how to get in there.

Luther, say again.

You have Bellerophon.

Oh, please!  How was I to know they had to be treated with Bellerophon within twenty hours?

Come on!

Maybe we donít have to know what he looks like.  If heís got that list, heís going to want to check it.  We should be looking for laptops.

Satisfied?

Donít Jim.

Don't give me that!  I was on the bridge.

What?

Did they send you...Did they send you?

What are you going to do?

I didn't say that.

Claire...Hey...

I donít think so.

Yes.

Passport, visas - you know the drill. We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley.  Throw the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects.  Follow me?

What?

I don't quite follow you.

Correct the actual list is safe at Langley.  "Golitsyn" was a lightning rod, one of ours.

Ethan, I can understand you're very upset.

Kittridge.

On what?

It's quite out of the question.

It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and <u>see</u> if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir.

I'm going to have to front you personally.  Don't lose that money without losing your life.

Simple game.  Four players.  Exfil opens the pocket --  -- cyber ops lifts the wallet.

Merci.

Higher.  Higher.

OK.  Taking Golitsyn's exit.  Jack, open the doors.

Would you remove your hat please?

I thought I'd take some now.

Oh?  What's the problem?

How was Chicago?

He won't be back in a hurry?

Sure.  If the main character does.

Where are you?

..the next day I managed to drag myself to the safe house, must've just missed you..anyway, I checked our aliases.

Hey, I showed 'em to you!

Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus.

Before London.  But after you took the Bible out of the Drake Hotel in Chicago.

Arenít you going to thank me Jim.  Ten million is better than six.

Why don't you take a look?

Thirty-two and change.

Yes...  Itís him.

Whatís the problem.

Is something wrong with the phone?  Well is something wrong with the batteries?

Very good, Mr. Johnny.

Who's dead?

I have no money!

I don't wanna talk about it.

You look tired.

In a month.

Yeah.

Here.

So you'll come to the wedding, right?

I got it done.

I won't have to shoot those dogs. They will kill each other.

I have no life.

It's wood. It's fake. Five years ago I was engaged to be married. Johnny came in here, he ordered bread from me. I put it in the slicer and I talked with him and my hand got caught cause I wasn't paying attention. The slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny 'cause - when my fiancé saw that I was maimed, she left me for another man.

That's it.

Loretta. What's that smell?

This is good. Uhh...

When your husband get hit by the bus?

I'm a wolf?

I've got you.

I'm marrying your brother!

But that's cause he don't know!

What are you talking about?

Alright.

You look beautiful. Your hair...

You're making me feel guilty again.

This is your place.

Why not?

He's coming.

What the hell are you talking about? We're engaged.

Hi Loretta.

Have Something.

We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.

Yes, on the floor.

I helped you buy it. It came with two pairs of pants. It's for luck, Johnny. When you propose marriage to a woman, you should kneel down.

I like this ring.

Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back?

He's my younger brother.

I have no secrets from my family.

So we'll sell the house.

And we'll sell the house.

I don't wanna talk about it.

Your hair's different.

We just come from the bank.

Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been two months since my last confession.

Don't fight.

Talk to him.

Moving in?

Who was that?

He doesn't like you. Thank you for answering my question.

Ronny! Our mother has recovered from death!

May I presume to ask you a question?

Thanks, comrade.

I'll remember that. What do you do?

Nerves.

You knew that man?

Temperature's dropping.

He's a plumber.

It's Cosmo's moon.

A witch,  a witch,  burn her!

Get away!

You're using coconuts!

It's not a question of where he grips it,  It's a simple matter of weight - ratios ...  A five-ounce bird could not hold a a one pound coconut.

Look! To maintain Velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings four hundred and ninety three times every second.   right?

There is much danger ... for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril which no man has ever crossed.

Seek you the Bridge of Death ...

Well, who is your lord?

Well, how did you become king, then?

Thanks you, Knights Who Say Ni!  You are fair and just.  We will return with a shrubbery.

None shall pass.

You're a liar.

Victory is mine.  I thank thee O Lord that in thy ...

You are indeed brave Sir knight, but the fight is mine.

I am King Arthur and these are the Knights of the Round Table.  Whose castle is this?

What is your name?

Who ... Who breaks out?

We shall attack at once.

Je...sus Christ!

Well you could say: "Dennis"

... must be approved at a bi-weekly meeting by a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs.

... but a two-thirds majority ...

Ah! NOW ... we see the violence inherent in the system.

Oh, Did you hear that!  What a give-away.

Good idea, O Lord!

The nose?

... Um ... Yes ... no ... a bit ... yes... she has got a wart.

Make a bridge out of her.

Exactly.  So... logically ...

Nothing... There's your ninepence.

No!  Not the curtains, lad ...  All that ...  all that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys ... as far as the eye can see and beyond ... that'll be your kingdom, lad.

Father, lad.

Herbert.

You fell out of the Tall Tower you creep!

Yes ...  make sure ...

Er ... +      You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?

Well Look, I'm afraid I really ought to be ...

We were in the nick of time.  You were in great peril.

You were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril.

No, no, this cannot be.   I am sworn to chastity!

When you have found the shrubbery, place the shrubbery here, beside this shrubbery ... only slightly higher, so you get a two-level effect with a path through the middle.

When you have found the shrubbery, then you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest ... with a herring.

They're all saying the word ...

|      You turd! +      Mangy scots git!

Er, That's ... That's enough music for a while, lads. It Looks as though like there's dirty work afoot.

Sixty.

One box of biscuits, one box of drop tablets, one box of pralines, sixteen chocolate sponges.  It's the same order every week, but does anybody bother to check it?  Now she has to travel all the way to Balmoral without the few luxuries she actually enjoys.

She's got an army of people to get her up and out.

She'll blow hot and cold on you, John, she always does.  You want to be careful.

What are you doing?!

Be careful who sees it.

You should have someone look after you.

It's what the maids are for.

Convey her a message.

Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to speak with her urgently about matters concerning the press.

By whose authority?

I'm sorry?

Then we'll have to see what can be arranged.

Do you?

That can wait till the weekend.

Don't think I can't persuade her.

Nobody has any rights over me.

Was there never ambition?

To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.

They don't see it.

Too busy looking after themselves.

You are well?

Mr Brown.

It is a fine spot for a bench, is it not?

What are those?

I am told so.

What is it, John?  John?

The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.

I was told you were in a fight.

-- When I took you out riding, come rain or shine, because I knew it was right for you, when I kept the bairns off your back so you could have a bit of peace, when I saw you safe from home to home and you didn't even know I was there...!  All I've ever thought about is you!

What can we do?

Your Majesty remains at the very epicenter of governance.  As for your people, look no further than the sales of your Highland Journals to see in what affection the nation holds their Queen.  You sell even more copies than Mr Dickens.

Should we take it seriously?

What did he want?

We're going to lose.

Gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. We need help.  Where is the old girl?

A distinct flushing around the cheeks. She was drunk, I tell you.

Quite.  I think I'd best take it back.

Has he been hurt?

Why not?

What is the matter with him?

What's the riddle?

Could you play ARCADE with that?

Level Ten.  That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found.

But how can it change every time?

The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the game.

He thinks I'm "sublimating".

So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's up to something...

Nick...

Listen to me!  Greg never came home. I think the game has something to do with it.

It turned itself back on, Nick.

It's not this weird.  It'll make sense. Everything gets weird this late anyway, right?

Well?

Change the channel!

It's growing.  Getting stronger. Maybe it's only localized now...

The Police, then...

You realize that in order to do that, we'd actually have to play the game.

It can turn itself on, Alex!  It doesn't need a quarter.

I know how to do this!  I'm good at these games.  You never play, you'd be nailed in an instant.

I don't want anything to happen to you.  I care about you.

Which way do you think Level Two is?

Okay.  It's West.

What the fuck is that?!

We can't reach that!

We can take the dunes down like a ski slope. Pretend you're on a snowboard.

Come on.  We'll hit Dante's after school, try the game out, maybe get some dinner.

It's here!!!

Mom?  You're alive...

But I don't understand...

We're glad you people could make it, and we're anxious to have you try out our new product.  We think it's going to be a big seller.  But you're the people that make it happen.  You're the market share everyone's tearing each other apart to get at.  It's your opinion that's going to make or break us.

This is one of our newest projects. We're trying to get rid of joy-sticks altogether ...

So start at the beginning...

They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.

Ray did ... and then they closed the set.... everybody's gone. You'd better get down here Adam!

Someone's shut off my money!

And?

But I'm not broke.

You'd better fix this, Ray!!!

Howdy!

What did I say?

No. You're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinkin'. Now I want ya to think and quit bein' such a smart aleck. Can ya do that for me?

Yes...what is it?

I...

No, I don't.

Wow!

Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.

Sorry to trouble you, Coco.

That's okay.

Betty Elms?

No, no, I'm fine.

Betty.

You're still here?

Stop... just stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before...

Well ... if you don't remember anything, I mean what goes through your mind then if you don't remember anything?

I don't know.

It's not my voice ... but I know her.

"So... surprise"...

"You're playing a dangerous game here. If you're trying to blackmail me... it's not going to work."

"Stop! Just Stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before..."

Oh, no wonder I'm starving. I'm going to fix a sandwich. You want one?

Why didn't you ask him? Sol knows you!

No... but...

Rita... I want you to stay here and you don't have to give me that money.

No. We shouldn't touch that money. We don't know about that money. That might be dangerous money. You have to start all over again. You look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person... whoever you want to be.

Yeah, what for?

I had a dream about this place.

Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere.

Yeah ... and they both use the same address.

So man, that's unheard of ... an accident like that ... who coulda foreseen that.

Hardly.

That's it folks for the Demon Boat Ride.... Everybody off. Watch your hands and feet.

You have 43 unpaid parking tickets, sir. You have the right to remain silent, anything you say can & will be held.....

Where are we ?

Why should we trust you ?

You said we were criminals, what did you mean ?

Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !

McCay knows ?

If we can get to through the next room, we'll be at a junction for a power grid.

What about you ?

Apparently pretty high, we just got a new CEO last week.

Are you Matthew Parker ?

That's very funny, sir. You are under arrest.

You okay ?

This probably isn't the bet time, but I really have to pee. Can I pee ?

Where ?

He's the liaison for McCay. Listen go. Go now.

I didn't think he'd make it past Scraps.

Don't eat at the console.

It's my control board and I don't want it acting squirrelly because you dropped a few crumbs into the keyboard, no put the shit away.

Never underestimate a man who cheats on his taxes. His file says he is an avid jogger.

But, he's...

Sir, I came from the Chicago offices myself, and if I may say, sir, there are still some very good....

Relax, son. They'll learn in time that you don't fuck with First Bank. This is the real deal and we aim to keep it strong. My Daddy always told me that Only The Strong Survive.

Zach, how old are you, son ?

And how much do we pay you annually ?

Thank you, sir. I was really hoping for shares, or possibly cash... but this, this is really personal.

I don't believe Ol' Bruce is having as much fun with this as he once did. He still insists on the "guests" being of the more nefarious type.

I propose we consider a hostile take over. Perhaps Ol' Bruce is in need of a new job opportunity.

I'll bet that would be the Park run of the century !

Do you think the assistant, what's his name...

Yes sir. It will be the best of your collection, I assure you.

He has a phone pole sticking in his chest, I think we don't need an autopsy.

Only that you were one of the finest hit men in the mob. That if you wanted a good clean kill, that Johnny Tortelli was the man for the job.

I had hoped you would say that. I have a proposal for you.....

What is Bruce doing ?

What was that ?

Aren't you going to switch exits on him again ?

Look he figured it out !

Okay, I have five that says THIS is it for them.

So what's next ? No one's ever made it this far before.

The power went out in half the park.

Good golly miss molly you are looking good today !

It's that asshole Zach isn't it ?

No, idiot. Where do we go now ?

No sir. I was just getting , well you know. Water. We weren't talking about sex or anything else except Star Wars. Just saying hello. I think I'm gonna go now.

We start with the top and work our way down. We start with the high salaries and then just let the little people go. No need to make the blue collars go crazy.

Look, Miss. I know you're still upset about that incident in Chicago, but understand, this is a cut throat business. We don't have time to play nursemaid to every single Tom Dick and Harry.

Her name was Maggie Muldovan.

People said she looked like me.

I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating.

I don't think you're very polite.

She was the uhh...first girl ever suspended for smoking.

Okay, no problem.

Visualize a spare?

Don't do that, you've got the whole garage.

The Collected Works of Alfred Biedermeyer

Hello? Sultenfuss Parlor.

Hi honey.

Good! You should go over and watch some Ted Carson.

Yeah.

Okay...bye daddy, I love you.

Reason? What reason?

I'm sorry I couldn't come pick you up honey.

What're you saying?

I'm glad you're here.

Oh she's great...she's a little crazy though. Anyway, Hillary said that you had a black Ford truck and this policeman I know got in touch with Motor Vehicles and...he gave me your address and here I am.

I told you it was a long story.

Special effects?

Would you like...eh...to have these movies?

It's good to see Maggie again...and you.

I'd say you turned out just fine.

See you? He can smell you from there.

That's ridiculous, so, if you really can't stand someone, then you pretend that you're really crazy about them?

Then what did she do?

So she had you in jail, in Russia?

Oh please, who do you think you're kidding? And where did she spy on the Russians from, here in Pennsylvania??

He's writing. Hello?

Vada what about you, who have you come up with?

There's water in your bathroom.

Don't wake up Vada.

I didn't ask for the money, Phil just gave it to me.

Getting off please.

They obviously have no sense of historical perspective either.

I never did understand that story, did someone find the needle or not?

Don't forget, the girls change their names if they got married.

If he has a heart attack you're carrying the body down yourself.

Hey what do I care...I mean, consider the sorts, a chick from Pennsylvania, who wears a mood ring.

Does it work?

Hey look!

Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?

That thing you said about your nose...it was a stranger's nose...well it's not...it's...I mean...it's yours...you know?

And I'm gonna use the movies when I give my report. Jeffrey says audiences love special effects.

An adventure?

Well Rose was being very thorough.

So does that mean that you sleep here every night?

Lock the door.

I feel like before I can talk to him I have to see his face.

Do you think I should tell my dad about Jeffrey Pommeroy?

I think this place is just fine.

Bye Aunt Rose.

Oh no, I, I...eh...I couldn't.

Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewelry.

Lizt was my parents' favorite, they were Hungarian.

Assuming the baby's a &quot;Supremes&quot; fan.

They're enormous, I know.

Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental.

Why not now?

Did it hurt a lot?

Beidermeyer?

He's a great poet.

Once you put the hotels on board walk and Park Place he puts a shoe in your way.

You're such a baby.

Of what??

Oh.. Oh.. Oh no?? Oh?

Keep your voice down!

Ex...ex, ex...

You are perfectly healthy.

Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today?

It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop.

It's still available I hope?

They're dead?

Stiffs??

You don't like it?

I just wanted to get past this &quot;old school Marm&quot; image.

Can not do without, Harry's wild about me.

Hi.

Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.

I had a good time tonight.

Yeah.

Dance with me?

Rock?

VADA!

Daddy, can I have thirty five dollars?

Dad??

Goodnight Vada.

Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together.

She likes to play bingo.

Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes REAL bad?

Are they ready yet?

When??

We're having the wedding sometime near the end of the summer.

Hi Vada.

Is that the fish you won at the carnival?

Maybe I should go over and yell at him.

What was my mama like?

Well well well, what's going on in here?

That's true. Harry Harry sit down, let me fill you in on today's women, since the last time you dated, something happened, &quot;The Sexual Revolution&quot;, now before that, you used to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull her chair out, pick up the check, no more no more, you wanna know what else is missing? BRAS!

Harry, I'm serious, trust me Harry this woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her like every Tom Dick and Harry.

Harry Harry Harry Harry Harry, I told you to use fewer briquettes and now look what you've done. You've cremated them.

Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of days.

Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr. J! How's the summer treating you?

Who's that?

No....

Really?

My Dad was funny?

Who's winning?

Vada? VADA?? What happened??

No.

Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?

The boys at school don't think I am.

Vada? Would you like us to get you another goldfish?

Daddy??!?!?!

Where's Daddy?

How old are you?

At what?

No, I'm going home.

It doesn't work, it always stays black. 

Naah, I don't wanna.

What's wrong with your eyes?

Do you remember her?

But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?

Bed wetter!

THIS!! 

Jump in the water!!

Hi Vada.

I dunno..

Yes it is, cause then he'll give you all A's and it won't be fair.

Close your eyes.

What?

For what?

Long trip.  Pretty nice of you to come.

Stay, huh?

See the pull of a book like Twenty Chefs, is not who I put in.  It's who I leave out.

Sometimes I do.  Like for two months.

He's the salt of the earth.  Kind and loyal and generous.  The one constant thing in my life, is he'll always be there.

Blood oath.

Same difference.  If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves.

Chill.  We don't want your face coming off with it.

He was in love with me every day for nine years.  I can make him happier than she can.

I don't know the meaning of the word guilt!

You're going to say it, aren't you?

Digger and George are with family in the Hamptons until Monday morning.  Brevity is even more in order than usual.

I'll think about it.  I'm okay.

Excuse me?

The bridesmaids are my only two female relatives under forty. Identical twin debutantes from Nashville, who are basically vengeful sluts.  With amazing bodies!

How about...

He'll see right through it.

Uh, Kimmy...?

Ex-cuse me?

If he gives you grief, I'll have him skillfully beaten, where the wounds won't show.

Julianne, reading my son-in-law's mail, is not something...

It's a fax from Sports Illustrated from Ben Isaacson, Michael's boss.

I think he's been fired.

I thought Michael was picking me up.

I haven't caused... a problem, have I?

Well, you're a little early...

I've been calling for days!

Well, that's great.  You haven't really had anybody since Dingbat Jennylee...

Well, sure.

Is there a coup de grace in here, somewh...

Waiter! Check, please!

Should I whistle down a cab?

Still.  All's fair in love and w...

You never eat when you're despondent.

It's weird being the groom.  All these things Kimmy has to take care of...

Wow and wow.  You have a date, after this?

You miss her, huh?

Don't you throw up on boat?

Well.  There's a lot of memories to choose from...

We could use... his computer, to... just E-mail those suckers right ou...

Michael? What ha...

... your one chance for true happiness?

What's up?

I mean, do you realize what you've... well, of course you realize, that's why you're confessing, I mean... I mean... how could you do that?

Why would she come here...

You can't believe you've lost her!  Sooner or later, you'll find her, and you'll look in each other's eyes, and you'll see all that love...

I'm just thinking of how she's hurting.  Lost.  Alone.  Like her life is over.

Well, the school will be here. Architecture will still be around. Right now...

Because I could come...

He never mentioned that.  Neither did y...

And to m...

All of a sudden, I'm supposed to drop out of school, forget my family, forget my career, forget all the plans I had for my life...

Reverend Dyer, this is Kimberly's somewhat butch maid of honor...

Maybe it's happy there.

Personally, I think Mr.  Michael's marrying the wrong girl.

You lost twenty-five dollars once before that, too, near Christmas time -- I remember that real well now. December 9th, to be exact.

Feed, mostly. Thought we'd get something for the kids.

You're from out of town?

No.

Barnett, please -

Oh, honey, I didn't mean to scare you.

I said, I've been real tired.

What's wrong with her.

What did you say your name was?

You going today?

I'll tell Ester, she'll be thrilled I saw you again.

I'm sorry. I feel as if I know you. I'm John Triplette... a friend of Del Reese... I was at the airport. I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm a great fan of hers. If there's anything you need, just give me a call. I'm at the Sheraton South.

I appreciate your concern, but she has to rest, so you can go on home.

Yes.

She's fine.

Well, that's not entirely true, Barnett. At least not according to Haven.

I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.

His Word.

What?

He's going to run for president.

It's on National television, Barnett.

Hi. I'm John Triplette.

What's he running for?

Okay.

Bastard

President?

It's an appearance. It has nothing to do with support. I don't even like him.

You're kidding.

Howdy.

Where are you going?

Hey!

Listen, we're suppose to sing on TV day after tomorrow. At the park...

Come on. He's a crook.

Need to have you check these out before he goes on that Walker benefit.

Thanks... I'll... go say hello to your mom.

Yes. I was in my Sophomore year at Harvard.

Sure... you're a fine boy, Ken, you really are.

Uh huh.

You know anything about the stations here?

What's this?

She had on high heels?

Wrecks.

What year?

When did you start singing?

Hello.

Yes. Who's this?

I don't know who you are.

What?

When did you think it would happen?

All I need is fifteen minutes a night.

Well, there's a couple of girls in Printers Alley if you got any questions. I know I've seen that G- string stuff for sale someplace around.

Oh, no.

Where's Bill?

You know Bill is really mad at you.

No  Hell, some secretary in New York just hands it to you. Only this one kept dropping it out of the box.

Dent it a little. Boy -- just she couldn1t even find it. She had a hamburger on her desk that looked three weeks old.

You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.

Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.

Wade -- I've been working toward this audition for years.

Oh, why thank you.

Now this is to raise funds for someone who can help people who are less fortunate than yourself. The more you take off, you see, more money we can raise.

What was the color of Tim's belt?

Is that a fact? Well then, Grace, could you tell us what form of martial arts it was that Tim was schooled in?

Point of fact, weren't Tim's hands registered as lethal weapons?

Mallory, what did you think of Mickey's plan? Did you think it would work?

What did you think then?

Did you have anything to do with the riot in the laundry room?

Try to keep it to a minimum.

Hasn't it?

Why are Mickey and Mallory being moved to an asylum? And who made the decision?

Because they wouldn't give them their blessing for marriage.

...one night I was asleep, and a noise wakes me up. I thought, 'Oh shit, somebody's broken in.' I didn't own a gun, so I go into the living room with a fucking umbrella. Okay, it turned out to be nothing. God made the noise. Who knows?

Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow you in half and you know it.

Do you have a back up.

You ready, Donut?

Yes.

My problem Mickey, is that you don't exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone on this. I need your help. I want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode. Now I have interviews with chairman of the prison board Dewight McClusky about this issue. And I'm tellin' ya, Mickey, he looks bad. The two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk to us, which always looks bad. I have an interview with both the judge of your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the psychologist and author, Emil Reinghold, both of which discount the notion that you're insane. You put that all together, and what the state is doing becomes obvious. But the network isn't satisfied. They feel the show needs another element. It needs you. In order to put the show on the air, I need to get an interview with you. You haven't talked to the press since your trial. Now, a few days before you get transferred to an asylum, you grant an interview on television with Wayne Gayle. We're talkin' a media event here. Every son of a bitch out the with a TV set's gonna tune in to see that. We'll make their motives so blatant, we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole thing. At least for a little while, the publicity would keep them from just giving you and Mallory lobotomies. Well, whatta ya say?

Everybody thought I'd gone crazy. The cops, my mom, everybody. But you see, they all missed the point of the story. I wasn't crazy. But when I was holding the shotgun, it all became clear. I realized for the first time my one true calling in life. I'm a natural born killer.

I could go for a Coke.

This is crazy. You can't escape like this.

C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.

Just wait one fucking minute.

Let's make a little music, Colorada.

I can't go. I'm too fucked up.

Yeah baby.

And they made the first move?

I admire them.

Through the power of the simple word---

Yes.

Apparently, they've seen all our films.

Roger, enough with the fucking donuts! What did I tell you. Stop bothering Mickey, and get behind your nagra.

And where do you keep Mickey?

Are you all set?

Yeah, we met. They're good men.

Good work, my brothers. Fan-fuckin'- tastic! I think that interview stuff's too long, we can lose some of that. Keep the girls, keep the long hairs, keep the Hun brothers, keep the black guy, keep the movie shit, and keep the cop at the donut shop. Lose the rest. And cut the interview with the prison board fellow before that. Cut it after I ask, 'I take it by your answer it was a whole new team.' Don't even let him answer. Fuck him. Then cut to me talking about the two chicken shit psychiatrists and straight in Dr. Reinghold laughing.

How's it working, Scotty?

Camera jam! I'm sorry Wayne. God.

But you see, that's okay, Wayne.

You met the kids I have working for me? Great bunch, aren't they?

It sure is.

Well, just what the hell do you expect me to do?

Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?

We got one...two...three...four ...five...six...seven...eight. I mean Jesus Christ, Phil, that's too much. Let's lose some of these guys.

Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and you, I can live with that. We're about ready to go here, so let's get rid of these other assholes.

How 'bout that furniture plant?

Yeah.

Want me to come?

That'll be thirty-eight cents.

I bet she's a sly little nigger, that girl. Wouldn't mind a piece of her myself!

I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!

Uh-huh. Well, this ain't the railroad. Now what's all this talk about stickin' together?

Want to keep your job, boy?

She got herself a husband now. They don' want him 'round. And I tell you, man, I got no use for him neither.

Hey, boy - I'm talkin' to you.

Looks like you're doin' a good job.

You know, man, that guy was trying to be friendly.

It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. Kinda took us by surprise.

Thank you, Ma'am. That's fine.

My father's the preacher.

So what you doin' with a cat like me in a joint like this?

How about another beer?

Not here, Duff.

I wouldn't have let you.

Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months after the Army. You been there?

Ain't your fault.

Goin' to see my kid.

Surprised?

I'm just going in to do my shopping.

That's right.

Your boy.

Don't push me, Duff.

That's Bessie Hall. Barney works at the mill.

Baby, you're the best thing that ever happened to me.

I'm telling you, baby, maybe we better get out of here.

About ten dollars.

You know - we do have enough money. Especially now.

You heard me!

Like hell they can't.  They can reach right in with their damn white hands and turn you off and on.

Where're you going to go?

Okay.

A whole lot, Frankie.

Like a home, for one thing.

How about a drink?

What happened?

I said, I come to town with a girl.

I asked you somethin', boy!

Pretty good for a one-armed nigger, huh?

Couldn't get the words out before.

Want me to hold the light for you?

Don't do her no good to get banged like that.

How often does he get like that?

Come back some other time, will you?

Well, what're you going to do?

Going back, huh?

Well, it looks like we'll be getting our new school.

Well, you've got to go easy. We haven't had any trouble in town for eight years, and we're not going to have any now.

I think if you tried livin' in a town like this, instead of running free and easy, you'd soon change your tune.

Well, you have to be reasonable. Now they say you're a troublemaker. That's no good. Use a little psychology. Make 'em think you're going along - and get what you want.

So I been told.

Well, if it ain't Duff!

I'll be a monkey's kid sister! What d'you want to do a thing like that for?

I'll talk to the Mayor.

Beck's just put us on standby for crisis entry.

They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?

Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?

You didn't come here to destroy Wintermute. You can to save a man you love. A man who isn't even capable of returning that love. Such a waste...

I'm getting used to it. Where are we?

A little incestuous, but at least it's original. Who's the guy in the halloween costume?

Those are all your records. I can have you cleared on all counts. Possession. ...Contributing to the delinquency of minors... Statutory rape.

Your gun, your prints. The Tessiers might overlook a little child molesting, but murder's bad P.R., Mr. Riviera. I suggest to reconsider my offer.

Then you'll have to persuade her to tell it to you.

It's the people close to me that tend to die... and I get the feeling you and I are going to be real buddies.  Terms?

I'll think you'll find everything in working order. Molly's just having a little fun.

I've heard about rogue A.I.'s, but there's only one guy who actually went up against one.

Working with a dead man. Shit, I've done about everything else.

Did you trace it?

Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier.

You're busy monkeys, Mr. Case. Busy, busy monkeys. Always building models... First stone circles. Then cathedrals... adding machines. I have no idea why I exist, do you know that? You... Your species eventually _had_ to create me. A thousand monkeys sitting at typewriters. One finally wrote "Wintermute".

Tell me the words.

I saw your girl yesterday.

Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?

Case... Yeah, Miami Joeboy, quick study. How you doing, kid?

Last I heard you cracked Sukura International. I couldn't believe it.

Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.

Nothin'. Not a goddamn thing. What the fuck...

Trajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio...  If we re-enter over Mexico, we just might make it.

Could be suicidal. It's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs.

Where the hell have you been?

It'll flatline your ass.

How much time you got left?

One minute eighteen and counting. What about the access code?

You haven't got it?

Wait... You hear that?

I hear that shit once a week. Don't worry. Jo Jo Bao loves me.

Case... are you okay?

I hope you can show more than you did when you let the Yakuza butcher Linda Lee.

What about before that?

You've been calling her name.

How soon is soon enough?

That's not going to help.

When I was fifteen Sense/Net iced my old man's credit record over some computer error. Once that goes down, that's it. He lost his business... everything. It destroyed him. I had to hustle arcade games for chump change. Dixie McCoy found me, figured I was a natural. He taught me the wires for a piece of the action.

The point is, if you unplug me when I'm flatlines, I'm history. I got no way back.

It sounds like you.

Case... it's four a.m.

He projects with neural implants.

The code's some riddle of 3Jane's. Once I'm in the matrix, you'll just have to take a shot at it.

Shit...

Laser fail-safe. You can't get the code wrong... it slags you. I can't let you try it.

When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.

How long will they watch us for?

What's that?

Have you ever wanted to go to The Court?

It's romantic, what you're doing, and they want to be a part of it.

No Roger from op/ed?

I had a lunch break so I thought I'd come by and see you. Your teacher is a fox!  Why don't we discuss that after class. But the burning is totally normal.  Oh look. Class is over already.

Well excuse me.

Guess who I did it with last night...

Who told!

Intra office. And they're not dating. They're having sex.

Okay. Remember when they took your office chair in for repairs and forgot to return it?

Forget it.

Anita!

Okay. If you've never kissed a guy, we got bigger problems than the underwear.

How about this?

Hey Josie. It's Josie, right?

Oh-my-God. You totally ripped off my Malibu Barbie idea.

You guys--what is the one thing that could ruin my senior prom?

Computer's down. Septuplets story. I need it back by five. Hopefully the copy's not a mess.

You've done five of my ideas.

They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?

You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?

Responding officers found minors, marijuana, and cheap wine coolers when they responded to a call to break up a party at what Southglen High Schoolers have come to call "The Court." Seventeen-year-old Kristen Rey says, "Yeah, everyone who's anyone is at The Court on Saturday night."

That's your story!

Your story was Rigfort's baby. We were scooped! We've got nothing. Zippo. You totally and completely screwed both of us.

Yes you are. A guy. Guy. Quite a guy. Oh my. Look at that--I rhymed.  Yikes.  Bikes!

Oh my god.

You having fun?

God, I can't do this.

You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time.

This--this is a luau that sells packing material!

Are mom and dad here?

No, I mean, no big whoop.

You're twenty-three years old!

Wow, Josie- you look really-

Rob--thanks. For everything. This is really happening. I never thought--

No- not really, Josie. NOT REALLY. How could you do that to me?  I helped you. I got you everything you wanted. And how do you repay me- you blow everything TWO DAYS before pro scouts come to see me play. Once they had seen me really play- they wouldn't have given a shit about my age.

Whoa. Deja Vu.

I don't know. And you know what's scary--when you get older it just gets more confusing. I've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me.  You know what, I shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you.

Thanks, Josie. This wasn't as bad as I thought.

You're really doing a great job here, Josie. I like your "can do" attitude.

Our penguin, right?

told him  --if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate!

What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?

Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?!  I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.

The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.

Billy Prince is asking you to prom.

That is so sad --

You ruined the whole thing!

Aloha! Welcome!

Rob, what do you want to be when you grow up?

Good. Gibby gave me champagne.

By name.

<i>                      I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb.</i>

<i>                      I've got something, listen now, This one is real good, you'll see. We'll send a present to his door Upon there'll be a note to read.</i>

He sure is big, Jack...

I do the best I can to make it comfortable for us here.

Coming...

When he left, he took a lot of equipment with him.

That's Lisa - I gotta get to school.

Help me with this thing!

You set this all up, didn't you?  One of your sick jokes?

Don't tell me it's not the gas!  Your mother thought she smelled gas.

He needs professional help.  I think we should take him to a psychiatrist.

So, you live around here.

Who told you to choke up that way?

Schneider shouldn't have called you out on that double.

What are you doing here?

The only thing trying to get into your body is female and waiting for you on a cabana floor.  And you want to sleep with me.  Go figure.

your timing was perfect - I was getting the third degree in there.

Hi!  You didn't have to wait.

"March 7th - Glen asked me to sleep with him again.  I can't yet - I like him, I want to make him happy but I'm not sure that I love him. I can't sleep with someone I don't love."

"Rod's been killed - he got Rod. Just Glen and me now.  Can't fall asleep!"

This is amazing!  Your dream told you where this was?

Look, you got electricity in your body, right?

Well, what am I supposed to do?

Nancy went bonkers from this thing. You wouldn't be afraid of being out on the beach with a potential lunatic?

I think I better go.  I'm just not into it tonight.  I'm sorry.

Who, Jesse?

Oh...uh, no, just some milk, Mom.

We're going up to bed now.

I've been good.  When do I get cigarette priveleges back?

Oh, right.  You're gonna be a TV star.

If Simms catches you in here after lights out, she'll chew my ass ragged.

Jennifer --

I know who's trying to kill you.

You didn't think we'd let you go alone?

It was great seeing you again.  I'm glad you dropped by.

When I was still a kid.  My folks got divorced.  After a while, I thought I'd imagined the whole thing.  I guess I didn't.

That man in my dreams.  He's real isn't he?

Freddy?

What's that?

What are these, beauty marks?

Oh yeah?  Well, if you're ever in the mood for a history lesson, I'm your teacher, understand?

Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?

You got five minutes.

Don't hold back on us, Max.  We need all the help we can get.

It's over.  It's over.

Anything?

Call it a passion.  I've got to get going.

Must have opened while I was away at school.

Do you?  You told me they're survivors...and they are.  But how much longer they survive is up to us.

The truth.

Only if you're willing to put aside everything you've learned and trust me. Can you do that?

We can try again.

What are we going to do?

Neil, it's no use.  You saw how he is.

Okay, straight talk only in here.

You do volunteer work at the hospital?

Freddy.

Nothing.  They're my patients.  It's my decision.  I want the dreams stopped until we get some answers.

Hi.

What do you think of the guinea fowl?

Lovely to meet you.

So tell me Anna -- what do you do?

I see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life.  What sort of acting do you do?

Okay.  So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards.

Coffee?

Something else cold -- coke, water, some disgusting sugary drink pretending to have something to do with fruits of the forest?

Thank you.

Here we go.

No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message.

Sorry about not ringing back.  The whole two-names concept was totally too much for my flatman's pea-sized intellect.

You'll have to prove it.  This is a great brownie and I'm going to fight for it.  State your claim.

Why is she in a wheelchair?

Whoopsidaisies.

No, I didn't.

I shouldn't have done that.  I shouldn't have done that.

I don't know where to go.  The hotel is surrounded.

I'm really sorry about last time.  He just flew in -- I had no idea -- in fact, I had no idea if he'd ever fly in again.

I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.

Cartwright.

Yup.

I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too.

You've got big feet.

You know what they say about men with big feet?

Wow.

Well...

Can I stay a bit longer?

As far as they're concerned I do.  And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu.

You're right: of course, you're right. It's just that I've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you've had it for ten minutes.  Our perspectives are different.

Excuse me?

You were saying...

Sorry about that.

Excuse me.

Nice one.  Would you like my phone number?

Can I just say, I thought 'Ghost' was a wonderful film.

He's bringing a girl?

Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...

Of course it is.  Any favourite among the 22?

Hi guys.  Oh holy fuck.

The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her.  You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!

Ahm... room service.

Are you a fan of Henry James?

Classic.  Absolutely classic. Profit from major sales push -- minus ?347.

I have to disturb you when you're cooking the books, but there's a delivery.

Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.

Max.  This is Anna.

'No comment' means 'yes.'

So I get the brownie?

Well?

Wait a minute -- I'm your brother and I don't know anything about this.

Any more announcements?

No, sir.

Cool, huh?

Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.

Imagine -- somewhere in the world there's a man who's allowed to kiss her.

There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.

Right.  No one else?

Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks.  Have you seen my glasses?

I don't mention that Anna's a vegetarian, did I?

Maybe.

Yes.

Spike!

Was it you?

No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.

Which floor?

So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.

Right -- well, then we have something of an impasse.  I tell you what -- I'll call the police -- and,	what can I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, I really apologize.

At the close of Friday's meeting, we were discussing Mister Harding's problem, concerning his wife...  Mister Harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street. Is that correct, Mister Harding?

But you have no proof.

Why?

What was it about her that disturbed you so, Billy?

You mean you don't want their votes to count, Billy!

P-p-p-please du-du-du-don't t-t tell her, p-p-please...

My name is Miss Ratched. I'm the head nurse here. You've already met Miss Pilbow and Aides Washington and Warren.

Please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know, don't hesitate to ask us.

Mister McMurphy, this ward is a democratic community run by the patients and their votes, so you should feel at ease in your new surroundings to the extent you can freely discuss emotional problems in front of the patients and staff. However, the cardinal rule, and I must emphasize this: Everyone keeps their seat during the meeting!

Pardon me, ma'am, can I ask you somethin'?

Certainly, Mister McMurphy.

Yes. Now was there anything else you wanted to discuss, Mister McMurphy?

Yeah, it'll satisfy me.

Mister McMurphy, you are deliberately violating the rules!...

You men remain seated!

Yeah, ya should've come along with us, Miss Ratched, an' gotten a little sun on your cheeks and maybe caught a fish or two.

Yeah, that's kind of crazy, ain't it!

Mister McMurphy.

I hope everything is settled.

Miss Ratched, would you please save a space for my aunt? She's comin' down from Portland.

Yes, Miss Ratched?

What I wanna know is who's the top loony around here?

Y-y-yes! Yes! Y-y-y-you s-s-saw wh wh-what she c-c-can do to us!

That's okay, kid...

A bus?

H-H-Help!

I-I-I-I-I'll g-g-g-go, M-M-Mack...

Candy? Hell no, Billy, she's just a good friend, that's all...

Goddammit, you sly son-of-a-bitch! Does anybody else know?

Ya like that, Chief, huh?

In there.

Go with him, Rose. Go with him.

He's a big flounder. Could weigh two, three hundred. You got to lift him in with a winch.

I'll bet a dollar.

Martini!

Miss Ratched is a competent psychiatric nurse, not some, some kind of monster pecking out our eyes!

With this thing! I'm gonna put this thing right through the window, that's how!

Ya owe me twenty-five bucks.

I'm busting outta this place.

Gimme a cigarette!

Why not?

Hear what?

'Kay, place your bets.

Bet a nickel!

You need four houses on every lot of the same color, Martini. Now let's go, for Christsakes.

Psst! Hey, Martini, wake up!

Gimme the ball!

I saw thum! I saw thum!

I wanna go home!

Gary Blinker's fulla shit!

Oh, what's that?

No, this is my first trip, Doc.

You bet, Doc!

Good, good, and how are you getting along on the ward?

Come on, Doc, you must be kiddin'.

Guidance and assistance! That's insane! Doc, ya gotta help me.

When?

Shhh... Remember this is a privilege, so I don't want none of you goons fuckin' up. Kay?

Up an' at 'em, Taber.

Bullshit. You ain't got no way out!

Ten bucks.

Yeah, take us back to the dumbwaiter, Mac.

Got a cigarette?

Well, you boys finish it up an' climb back into your beds. 'Kay?

Hey, how ya doin', cutie?

Sure, she understands what you mean. She's not dumb. Why do you think Rose came to visit us? Rose is very interested in hospitals and hospital facilities. Aren't you, Rose?

Yeah!

Yeah, how much you wanna bet?

There they are!

Hey, Sam, bet ya two bucks ya lose.

Bet!

Is everything all right?

What are these men doing up wandering around?

Whew! Hiya, boys!

Smells like piss. Is this real, Candy? Is this really real? I mean we are in an insane asylum, an' I wanna know how we got ourselves into this scene.

Not exactly, Miss. Not exactly.

Is he in an asylum?

Your grandmother?

You ask what room he's in, okay?

He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here.

He said he thinks a woman he works with knows him.  Her name's Anna. But she won't be in 'til tomorrow.

She's trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker.

Were they pen pals?

Oh, right.  Dwayne.  You're engaged to Dwayne?

You're sure...

Good.

Don't be afraid.  You can tell me.

You don't think this is just infatuation, do you?

And, he's a friend of yours.  It's Dwayne.

A very large pig.

No.

...has a prior commitment.

Yeah, but, what if this guy lived a billion, trillion years ago? Like, what if he was a cave man, and now he's dead?

Yeah, but, what if he doesn't live here?  Like, what if he's a cannibal in New Guinea or something?

Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is.  I know where to find him.

Lots of history.  For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens?

Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.

Venice?  I love Venice.  With the boats, right?...

Are you okay?  You want some help?

It's in the south.  I've still got my rental car.  I can get you there by morning...

The guy at the hotel told me he always wears a gold medallion, and usually has a book or magazine with him.

You okay?

Hi.

I'd call that a yes.  Do I get a hint?

And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.

Yes.  I'm crazy.  You have driven me crazy.  No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you.  Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up?  How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated?

I was hoping for the real thing.

Any night.

Sure.

You know, I noticed you out at the pool even before we spoke.  I could sense the chemistry between us.

So, what are we waiting for?

I don't believe in statistics.

I don't have an Amana freezer.

You don't have any idea?

"Thrills"?  That's what you're waiting for?  You know how long that lasts?  Besides, how do you know?  Have you ever been out with him?

But what?

It's a miracle.

It was my New Year's resolution to overcome it.

That's where you're wrong.  I got one nine years ago.  I just never had an opportunity to use it.

Just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for.

That was a long time ago.

Anna, I'm Faith.  You don't know how happy I am to meet you.  You see, I'm trying to find someone, and--

I sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe he'd notice me first?

So what's in a name?  I wanna join him.  I don't see why we can't join him.

Right, right...  Okay..  You don't think he's gonna think I'm too aggressive?

Faith--

I'm sure.  And Kate, thank you for coming.  Thank you for being such a good friend.

Amazing...

Joan Collins stayed here.

Kate.  Thank God you're there. I need help.

I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel.

You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate?

My friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is.  Can you tell us what she's saying?

It's siesta.

Kate, you're still there?  I thought you'd be on your way home by now.

Not only is it tacky, it's exploitation.

It was just a joke.  I was pushing the arrow.  I wanted to get to the next question.  I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.

I have to talk to her.

Right now?

I'm gonna take her home first.

When he got up and chased them they thought it was a dead man coming after them.

Come on, kid. I'll buy you a drink.

Working hard?

Gee, Charley, I'm sure glad you stopped by for me. I needed to talk to you. What's it they say about blood, it's 

I always figured I'd live longer without it.

Absolutely nothing. You do nothing and you say nothing. You understand, don't you, kid?

You don't mean you're thinking of testifying against 

Well, then, you know Cousin Johnny isn't going to jeopardize a setup like that for one rubber-lipped

Take the boss loading, kid. For God's sake. I don't want to hurt you.

...eight-seven, eighty-eight. What's it to you?

It wasn't him!  It was you, Charley. You and Johnny. Like the night the two of youse come in the dressing room and says, "Kid, this ain't your night we're going for the price on Wilson." It ain't my night. I'd of taken Wilson apart that night! I was ready remember the early rounds throwing them combinations. So what happens This bum Wilson he gets the title shot outdoors in the ballpark!  and what do I get a couple of bucks and a one-way ticket to Palookaville.  It was you, Charley. You was my brother. You should of looked out for me. Instead of making me take them dives for the short-end money.

Don't turn away! Look at it! You're in this too don't you see, don't you see? You're in this too, Father.

Father Barry.

They're waiting for him to walk in.

I'm with Terry.

I know. I thought I'd never get those braces off.

I can get home all right from here

The moment I saw you.

Maybe they just didn't know how to handle you.

When Mother died Pop sent me out to school in the country. He was afraid with no one home I'd get into bad company.

I changed my mind. I feel real mean tonight.

How do you like that one?

Listen, you like beer?

No thanks... .

I never met such a person. Not a spark of romance or sentiment or or human kindness in your whole body.

Why, Terry, who said it was?

You don't believe in anything, do you?

You haven't finished your beer.

What are you crying for?

What are you going to do?

I don't rate it.

Edie I I never said this to a girl before, I never knew a girl worth trying to say it for, but you you're... .

Terry what's happening to you?

Jimmy...

I don't get it!

It started as a favor for my brother you know they'd ask me things and it's hard to say no a favor Who am I kiddin'? They call it a favor but it's do it or else. And this time the favor turned out to be helping them knock off Joey. I just thought they'd lean on him a little but Last night with Edie I wanted to tell her only it stuck in my throat. I guess I was scared of drivin' her away and I love her, Father. She's the first thing I ever loved.

About Edie?

This is my business.

Now listen, if you know who the pistols are, if you see them on the dock every day, are you going to keep still until they cut you down one by one?  Are you? Are you? How about you, Nolan?

What do you think?

You're Terry Malloy, aren't you?

Be at the State House, Courtroom Nine, at ten o'clock tomorrow.

I was gonna feed 'em, Terry.

She's a he. His name is Swifty.

A cheese-eater!  You're kidding!

No advice. Just whiskey.

Yeah? Must be Danny-boy. I lost him in the last race.

I I was just on my way up, Johnny.

A dime. One thin dime for a cup of coffee.

Yeah, yeah Here's half a buck, go have yourself a ball.

A banana boat. It would be bananas.  One of these days me ship's comin' in from Ireland,  God love 'er, loaded to the gunnels with sweet Irish whiskey!

You see, Kayo, the good Lord watches over us after all.

I was afraid one bottle might get lonely by itself.  Now you see the advantage of a little man in a big coat.

The brother of Charley the Gent. They'll help us get to the bottom of the river.

Leave her alone, I tell you!

We sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery.  Let's turn back.

But does it have to be in a cemetery?

Well we certainly can't stay here. C'mon.

Silly, there's nothing in there to be afraid of.

That's what I want to find out. We have to get help.

Could it be some kind of college initiation?

Can't we get out of here?

Look!

The ropes are coming loose.

I am--It's our only chance.

My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.

You're talking nonsense.

That sudden?

I don't know, yet.  We'll just have to watch our chance. When it comes I'll know what to do--I hope I'll know what to do.

You love me then?

But they are not yet one of us.

What kind of symbol?

Oh, yes, a religion of sorts.

I suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon.

Well?

At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...

There are others.

The moon sinks lower into the hills!  We must hurry to the finish.

Your pleasures of course!

Then it is some service you desire of us.

There are one or two which should complement the night's entertainment, Master

Ahh, the curiousity of youth... on the road to ruin!  May it ever be so adventurous!

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.

Hurt her?  Hell, it killed her!

He wants us.

What do you suppose for?

You know that Super Bowl party?  They changed the date.  It's on <u>tonight</u>, eight-thirty.

Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that party is today instead of Sunday. About eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now.  So you'll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might be doing...

Oh, is this Adele?

You were <i>both</i> in the trunk?  Together?

But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?

But you spoke to him on the phone.

He called the day he escaped.

Did you know that when you married him?

I'll say one thing for Jack, he was never ugly or mean, or drank too much. He was very considerate, lights on or off, if you know what I mean.

Adele, sooner or later, he's gonna get caught.  I'd like to get him before he does something else, makes it worse on himself.

Adele?  You in there?

Go away, or I'll call the police.

Where in the hell are we?

Jesus Christ, what were you doing in there?

Do we need him?

Wait a minute.  Let me have your raincoat.  Somebody forgot to bring me clean clothes.

Why you brought Glenn into this, I'll never know.

I'm just saying she wasn't scared.

Longer we hang around down here, Jack, better chance there is either Glenn's gonna fuck up the whole score, or we gonna get busted, or both.

So call her up.  Tell her don't talk to any Cubans.

You at least bring the gun?

Now that's a really big house.

Getting me out of Glades for starters.

They look like plain old rocks.

I'm going back inside.

No, you dump the van, meet me at the airport. I'll take one of Ripley's cars.

There's a couple of points I keep wondering about have to do with the two guys that grabbed you.  Buddy is it?  And this fella Jack Foley.  I swear the man must've robbed two hundred banks in his time.

Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman, the one you were seeing, it turns out the same time he was doing banks.  You recall that?

I have to qualify, is that it?

Now you see Foley and this guy Bragg come in behind us, whatta you do?

Other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together.  You gonna tell me why you're comin' to me instead of the FBI?

You know, I'm not in homicide any more.

That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.

Hello?

Karen, I told you not to--

How much for your company at chow?

Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower.

Look, Snoop, I don't know what Glenn promised you or what you think you're gonna get, but the deal is me and Buddy get half of whatever we take from Ripley, understand?  How you and Glenn cut up the rest is up to you.

Soon as we leave here.  Stop home and pick up what we need and go do it.

That what they're wearing these days to break and enter?

Why you're just a girl.  What do you do for a living you pack a shotgun?

There isn't any.  All this shit you got in here.  What is all this stuff anyway?  Handcuffs, chains... what's this can?

Boy, it stunk in there.

Guys like me, huh.  Well, listen, even though I've been celibate lately, I'm not gonna force myself on you.  I've never done that in my life.

So, what's <u>your</u> name?  It'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway.

You don't act like it.

Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV...

And the guy saying he wasn't gonna take any more shit from anybody...

Yeah, right.  Anyway, that scene where Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get shot?  I remember thinking at the time it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you have to.

Get your hands up and turn around. <u>Now</u>.

There's a guy here on the task force right now.  Maybe I should put him on the phone, let you two work it out.

You like bourbon?

A girl.

Oh, God...

Remember how talkative you were?  In the trunk?  Adele said you do that when you're nervous.

I might've smelled like a sewer, but you could tell I was a gentleman. They say John Dillinger was a pretty nice guy.

I wasn't sure you caught that.

I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that?  Take her with you and put her in back.

She <i>knew</i> me from some bullshit dope bust.  She drove me to court.  Twice. You know what she said, we're in the car on the turnpike?  "I never forget anybody I've cuffed and shackled."

I expect you to look out for me, Pup, let me run off work details.

You don't wanna be standing there, the hacks start asking questions you don't wanna answer.

You're smart, Ripley, you'll tell this guy to fuck off.

I know what you're talking about.

Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.

You goin' right back to work?

Gentlemen.  I think we've calmed down now.  Haven't we, Jack?

Foley?  That you?

Dumbfuck Glenn was right, there's about five million worth in there, wouldn't you say, Richard?

You were at Leavenworth, huh?

And how long was it before they caught up with you?

She did, huh.

I'll send it to you at Glades.

I got a big score lined up up north. They wouldn't even know about it, it wasn't for me.  I could do it right now myself, except it's so fucking cold up there in January--

Do we have a gun in the car?

Glenn, take the exit.

Why's that?

You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up.

You there?

Thing I'm worried about is you.

Yeah.  If you can step up and actually do it.  Understand?  'Stead of just talking the talk.

I'm looking for Maurice.

That's not Maurice?

You like to sit down?

Well, <i>he</i> ain't even here that much.  I like to know where he goes, but at the same time I don't <i>want</i> to know, you understand?

Thanks, Dad.

Can we change the subject?

How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?

You were talking in your sleep.

"Hey, yourself."

Buddy's sister Regina Mary Bragg got two calls from Buddy up in Detroit this morning, called Burdon.  She's also the one gave Burdon Buddy's address.

Yeah, someone spotted two of 'em in this hobo camp out by the airport, called the number--

That Bausch & Lomb Saline shit you asked for is gonna be eighty bucks.

Foley's got it.

We have a problem here?

You good-lookin' sumbitch...don't you EVER die!

Now listen, it's hands off Billy.  I mean, you can put your hands on him if you want to, but then my hands will break yours.

I wish she could forget him.

Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?

Rafe's girl, Evelyn?

Didn't you say test the limits?

Don't make this a joke, Rafe.  You're talking about war, and I know what war does to people.

Then why are you looking for her?

Sorry.

I didn't mean it.

She said I was so much like you.  I said, No, I'm not.  I'm like I am because of you, but I'm not you, not as good as you. Everybody else saw me as a loser with a big chip on his shoulder.  But you saw the better part of me, the part of me that could be like you, and changed me. You made me who I am.

You hear my okay?

I'm out of ammo!

What do you mean?  I'm just doing what we've always done.

It's shorter than our practice runway.

Danny...

What about easier to hit in an air raid?

And where's the secret base, Sir?  The one we t-takeoff from.

C-Colonel, we been p-practicing takeoff's, but I ain't sure we can land on these carriers d-decks.

Don't get smart with me, son.

That's bullshit, son.  But it's really good bullshit.

I heard what you did.

In flight school you qualified in single and in multi-engine planes.  You'll be flying multi-engines here.

Thank you, 'Mam.

You take care, Dorie.

Hello, Lieutenant.  Good to see you.

Danny's not coming?

Whatever you're trying to tell me isn't good, is it.  Or it wouldn't be so hard to say.

It's been...so different, being so sure you were dead.

Don't worry about that.  Guys away from home, lonely, good-hearted women try to cheer them up.

What else can we do?

Rafe --

What?...

We have achieved surprise, but their carriers are not in port.  I don't like this.

The Chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the Jap patrols do, if any of the planes make it.

Do you believe in all of that?

What does Grandma think you do at your meetings?

Do you have to wear that hat?

There's something pathetic parked in front of my house.

Not that I'm glad you were sick, but I had a chance to do some thinking last night.

Looking good out there.

Where did you get that sweater?

Charlie, what do you think of Richard Norvik?

You know. Your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing!

This is a mistake. We better forget it.

But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand.

Charlie. I just had the strangest dream.

What are you doing here?

I want to know what's going on. Dolores told me that you and that scuzzball Michael Fitzsimmons...

Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man.

What're you doing here?

Not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit. Honest.

Look. I wanna tell you. I forgive you for everything. I know what you've been going through. You're just scared. I was scared, too, but I'm not anymore.

Oh, Charlie.

Peggy! Where're you going? Come back!

Charlie, I had a strange experience.  I went back to high school. And I spent a lot of time with you.  And you and Walter and Leon were singing "I Wonder Why".

God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.

Hey Terry, what is that?  Did Peggy make it up?  I've never seen that on Bandstand.

It was my idea, Grandma. I always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings.

Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.

This is great reefer.

Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us.

Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.

You're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits.

If all the kids jumped off a bridge, would you do that too?

I closed my Christmas club.

He'll win.

You mean to tell me that you invited this Mr. Fitzsimmons over to talk about investing his money in your cockamamie idea?

Does everybody have to hear?

Mom!

I have a note.

Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home.

That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset.  Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.

Maddy's party.

Isn't that awfully forward?

You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends. Besides, it's over with me and Charlie.

What are you doing?

Teenagers are weird. And you're the weirdest.

It's unbelievable. The man never ages.

And the butter.

He's not here. We're getting divorced.

The only time people like Dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me. That guy, Doug Snell, who shook my hand when we walked in, he used to call me a foureyed worm.

Congratulations on the math contest, Richard.

It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?

Sort of.

And then, there's Richard's Burrito.

That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.

Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.

You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes

Okay. I promise.

I'd be very careful if I were you. You don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain.

What're you doing?

All right, I'll work on it, I'll, do some research. But in the meantime, don't get crazy.

No offense, but for a person who says she's lived an extra lifetime, you certainly are thick. Money is power.. Money makes people respect you...

Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.

The wave of the future! I've decided on our first fortune! I'll see you later. You just think high tech.

It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time.

Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?

You are completely relaxed. When I count to three, you will open your eyes. One... two... three.  We'll start with something easy. What is your name?

Why are you bothering me about this? Can't you leave it be?

Believe what you saw, Matthews. The dog was dead.

That's Renee alright.

Thee facial lacerations should heal up pretty quickly. I'll give you som antibiotic cream--

Out?

What happened to you?

Geoff, dinner's ready!  Geoff?!

Geoff, this is crazy. Zowie didn't die.

All set?

Not that much appreciation. I thought we were gonna tone down that flabby ass.

Come on, that's just a bullshit story. You said so yourself...

You think my Dad'll figure out why he's not getting better?

Do you think everyone that came back would be like Gus?

I gotta go back and do my chores...

Jesus.

Allright. Calm down.

What was the file name?

Why, Beckett?

Perhaps... you're right. I've certainly been busy. With the Kronos complaint, a preliminary injunction hearing and the Saunders trial all falling at the same time...

Thanks, you guys.

Aren't you giving an exam?

It could be parasites, an infection...

Hold still. Shit.  The goddamn vein's clotted. We have to go the goddamn hospital, so they can change the goddamn catheter.

I'm not going to close the--

Your Honor, since Rockwell Corp. began construction, the surrounding residential neighborhood has been enshrouded in a cloud of foul-smelling, germ-carrying, pestilent dust. My client is being forced to breathe known carcinogens daily! Other residents are coming forth on a daily basis to add their voices of outrage!

Correct. I'm seeking representation.

Miguel Alvarez. We've lived together for nine years.

I buy that.

I knew you were going to say that. I don't buy it, and I don't see a case.

How did they find out?

So Kenton connected the... lesion, <u>and</u> whatever suspicions he had about your personal life... to this woman, Maria... and blew the whistle on you. Suddenly you're losing files, and it's time to let you go. But, up to this point, you've been their Golden Boy, their rising star... Their behavior is... inconsistent.

Beckett. You seem... better. Energized, more alive...

I'm a law suit.

Get it?

Beckett?

Opera?

He was... the kind of person I thought I wanted to be.

I better get home. Lisa and I are having some friends over.

What can I do?

You said earlier you aspired to be the kind of person who had "an adventurous spirit." Is that correct?

In general. Do you take risks in other areas of your life?

What kind of movies do they show there?

Were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there, called AIDS, and that you could contract it through sexual activity?

By the time I was fired, there were four lesions on my face, much bigger...

No. I can't really see it.

Mom?

Were you recently promoted?

I said my earrings <u>are</u> American. They're African-American.

Objection!

Objection!

The HIV virus can only be transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids, namely blood and semen.

It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?

A homosexual encounter.

Unprotected sex with a prostitute.

But, Andrew Beckett was in charge of litigation for the suit.

Were you pleased with his work?

Let's put it this way, Andy: your place in the future of this firm is no longer secure.

You load the film... ? No, on this side... or this side? Don't move the baby!

Don't know, Joe.

Did I ever tell you, I hate costume parties?

Now that you mention it...

Not when I was in the Navy.

Yeah. But we took care of him.

Attorney for the plaintiff?

I've seen your television commercials. "If you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others... It should say, "through the <u>negligence</u> of others."

Based on what my client would have earned over the next three years, including benefits and projected raises, and the extraordinary cost of medical care for someone with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome... We would settle today for the very fair amount of one million five hundred thousand dollars.

Wait a minute. The man was fired for incompetence, not because he has AIDS. You didn't know he was sick, did you, Bob?

You'll be sorry, Beckett.

... interview every employee, support staff, associates, partners. Did <u>any</u> of them know Andy was sick? <u>How</u> did they know? Did he tell them? Did they notice something was wrong with his appearance? None of this information got to the managing partners. We know that. Make sure everyone else does too... And Beckett: I want to know everything about his personal life. Did he frequent those pathetic bars on Camac Street?

Very interesting, Bob. Let's make a note of that. Andy didn't lose the complaint in his computer. He never put it in. He lied about that, too.

Don't wanna miss this.

What? What is it?

I didn't want you to leave me there... back at the ship...that's why I didn't say anything....

Bring the light!

You did this? To yourself?

Power cells.

Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet.  Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape.

As fast as you can.

'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that.

You'd die for them?

What, switch what?

S'matter?

Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you even more.

Better keep moving....

Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn.

Sorry. Thought I heard something.

15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five. Five total to launch.

Wait for what? Until it's so dark we can't even find our way back to --

Oh, this is a dangerous game you're playing, Johns.

You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.

You know, he hasn't harmed any of us. Far as I can tell, he hasn't even lied to us. Just stick to the deal, Johns. Let him go if that's what it --

You're not a real cop, are you? Just some mercenary who goes around talkin' about the law like --

You have a little caffeine in the morning, I have a little morphine. So what?

You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.

We aren't completely stupid.

Why did I fall on you?

Owens!

Hasan?

They're afraid of our light. That means we don't have to be so afraid of them.

Oh, no. No, no, no....

What're you doin'?

Suleiman!

Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this.

She's the captain, we should listen to --

So just like that. Wave your little wand and he's one of us now.

Very big beads.

Want you to remember this moment, Riddick. The way it coulda gone and didn't.

Think about that reward, Johns.

About how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!

Six of us left. If we could get through that canyon and lose just one, that'd be quite a fucking feat, huh? A good thing, right?

<u>Trawl</u> with it. There's a cable on the sled. We can drag the body behind us.

Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just keep 'em off our scent.

Dr. Zaius --

Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.

How did you know we'd come here?

As you wish.

The blood transfusion.

'Then how do you account for me?,

But what about your theory? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it.

Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -

-- that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate, possibly man. In his trip to the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time -

We'd better get started. If the mounted police pick up our trail, they'll come this far at least.

Nothing will grow here .... there's just a trace of hydrocarbons, and most of the nitrogen is locked into nitrates.

Where there's one there's another. And another. And another.

He can reason? With the Tribunal's permission, let me expose this hoax by direct examination.

That's true, Dr. Zaius. My witnesses -- correction -- my exhibits are on display in the amphitheater.

Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith?

Good morning, Dr. Zira.

Gone.

Well? Where are we? Have any notion, skipper?

Landon! Join the expedition.

Air leak. Died in her sleep.

Apart from that, you look pretty chipper for a man who's two thousand and thirty one years old.  I read the clocks. They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis. We've been away from Earth for two thousand years, give or take a decade.  Still can't accept it, huh?

Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.

If only we could get a fix.

All right --

Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you?

Dodge ... he's not like me at all. But he makes sense. Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew. I understand why  he's here. But you...You're no seeker. You're negative.

She comes along too.

Gorilla hunters ...

What is that?

Yes, Sir. But this -- creature is a special case.

Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down.

Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential, and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal.  You may proceed, Dr. Honorius.

Sustained. In all fairness, Dr. Zira, you must admit the accused is a nonape, and therefore has no rights under ape law.

This is a joke in very poor taste.

How so?

No.

You lied. Where is your tribe?

A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?

You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.  The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.  Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?

There is no contradiction between faith and science. True science.

Sure.	In a cage.

We're back at the beginning. I still don't know the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. A world turned wrong side up. A puzzle with one piece missing.

Where have you been? Why didn't you come to see me?

Are you going to take her with you?

What's the diagnosis, doctor? A touch of the sun?

Wouldn't it more properly be done in your office?

But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.

How sad. Stuffed and mounted, eh? Dead men, like sunken ships, can tell no stories. And his other companion?

But suppose you find nothing but a wasteland. How will you survive?

Bunker...

Blood trail just keeps going and going but no body.

WHAT THE FUCK YOU DOING!

We got boo-coo movement. 3rd Battalion just got hit 15 kliks north of here. 

Uh... Bob. Like to speak to you. Take a minute.

Hey Bob, come on! Talk to me hunh, it's your friend Red, I'm only asking you for three days chief...

Bob, I gotta bad feeling about this, I... I'm telling you I got a bad feeling, man, I don't think I'm gonna make it... y'know what I mean?

C'mon man, didn't I do you right that time I give you the turkey loaf for the ham and lima beans shit.

Listen to that shit, that's good shit!

Fuck this shit!

Taylor! Francis!

Where's Lerner?

What you got there - beers?

You okay man? Neck botherin' you?

Three years, Jesus, he's crazy as Barnes...

Hey that's great King, that's great... you take it on home for me, you tell 'em King... got your address right? You know where you can reach men, man. Anytime!

Shit! Morehouse and Sal are short. Fu Sheng's going on R&R, you don't want to send their asses out on an ambush. You got the fresh meat Elias.

Tell Six we need engineers here, this pos. is crawling with traps.

Whatcha doing in the underworld Taylor?

Merle?

I know Barnes six months and I'll tell ya something - that man is MEAN, red in his soul like a dick on a dog.

I was home on leave y'know and everybody's just worried 'bout making money, everybody's out for themselves, they don't even want to talk about it man, it's like the fucking Twilight Zone back there - you wouldn't even KNOW there's a war on here. My sister says to me why you have to go there like I started this...

You wanted to see me sir?

You don't want to hear about it?

Vancouver, B.C.

How about taking to Uncle Larry into the old firm? He's a useful guy to have on your side.

Dine and dance tonight? I've got fifty bucks to throw away.

Okay. You win.

I'm afraid there's nothing more tonight, Miss. Unless you charter a plane.

They might think I was running away from something.

I'm Mr. Campbell, Miss Mayfield.  Purely as a matter of routine, I want to ask the name of your bank.

It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.

No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But..  If you really want a good dry Martini..

And do you amuse the guests?

You're drinking it.

How did you meet him?

There's one thing I may as well tell you. You'll find it out anyhow. I tried to run away--when I found him out there on the balcony. There wasn't any plane.

Then he's got to be a detective.

Us?

That's the second round I've lost tonight.  That fellow hurt me.

I hated to go to that place.  I almost went to the police station instead.

This is the ace, Betty.  But not of spades.  They'll find out about the other.  They might know already. And when they get this--  What would they look for?  Where? Out there somewhere? 

I run over to Victoria.  Play some golf with some people I know.  Do it all the time.  That's why I have a cabin cruiser.  Custom- built.Forty knots.  Mr Clark Brandon an almost gentleman of almost complete leisure.  Member of six golf clubs.  Broke 70 once on the Shaughnessy Heights Course.  You have to be good to do that, And if you look out of a front window of the Empress Hotel in Victoria, in a few hours you can look right down on Mr. Brandon's boat, the Valkyrie.  Came alone?  Sure.  He always comes alone.  Mr Brandon's a rather lonely man.

Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere.  Of course she might have run away--if she knew how.  And where to go.  She might have dyed her hair.  Bleached it before probably.  And changed her name again.  But look at this note.  And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there.  Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that.  Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance.

Well?

It buys things, just like any other kind.

No.  I paid him off.

Not this one.  And not Mitchell.

Don't go soft on me, baby.  I've got your note in my pocket.  You wrote it, all by your own self. And I have to use it.  It has to be found in exactly the right place.

Would I want to?

Mrs. West is a very emotional woman.

I'll have to know a little more than that.

I'm sorry.

Where's you get it?

Care for a stroll outside? Beautiful morning. The air is like wine, the sky is a deep blue.

Down below's Stanley Park. On the other side of the trees, there's a beach. You can see it.  Steveston's over there. Coast Guard station.  There's the Yacht Club, and beyond it, the docks. The over on the other side of the inlet, there's Grouse Mountain. It's about 4000 feet high. There's a restaurant on top of it. Very nice restaurant.  I'm sorry we couldn't have met in pleasanter circumstances, Miss Mayfield.

You wouldn't even try  There must be some copper in you, or you wouldn't be an inspector.

They call me Jeff.

Not quiet yet.  We know who the gun belonged to. Margo West.  She told us this morning.  It doesn't mean much.  Mitchell took it away from her.  He had a habit of going through her bag.

So Mitchell had handled it. Afterwards, Brandon picked it up.  There's no indication you handled it.

What proper grounds?  You can't be in love with me.  You hardly know me.  I'm not in love with you.

But even if you were in love with me.

He could have killed me a dozen times.  You'd never have known.

But I tell you---if you'd only understand.

What are your rates?

That's a nice hard knee you've got, Goble. How'd you like to trade it for a broken neck?

I go home and paint the kitchen.

Got it on you?

Hi Margo. Hello Killaine. You two come together?

You make friends quickly, don't you, Clark?

And without much discrimination.

Who told you my name?

What's this in favor of?

What?

Somebody Mitchell picked up on the train. I don't even know her name.

Where?

Thanks.  Lovely view you have, haven't you?

You'd be breaking the law.

Mitchell was too drunk.

Hello, Mitchell. Having fun?

What's the matter, baby. Don't you like me anymore?

I wouldn't know. Just do it somewhere else. There is such a thing as good manners.

One of these days, you're going to wake up in the middle of the night and find that you've cut your throat.

And don't get too logical, Driscoll. In police business it doesn't work. I wish it did.  But it doesn't

I got through to Greer, his partner in the detective business.  Greer won't give out.

Send that?

Catch me at the Vancouver Royal if it's important.

What do I get for it?

Right.

And she did give him the chance, the way it worked out.

What about me?

You knew Mitchell pretty well, didn't you, Mrs. West?

Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?

It does.  May I go now? 

No doubt about that one.

Mayfield?  She fit into this?

Killaine, this is Mr. Mitchell, Senior.  Young Mitchell's father. He just flew in from Toronto.

I've explained the situation to Mr. Mitchell up to a point.  Now about this Mayfield girl?

Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.

This girl is a murderess, Killaine.

Elizabeth Kinsolving, arrested Greenwater, North Carolina, January 8, 1948, on a charge of murder.  Signed, FBI., Washington, D.C. H. Cleary, Inspector in charge."  Have ye any comment, Killaine?

You're a young man.  You're romantic.  You think a pretty face and a clean conscience go together. You think a soft voice means a soft heart.  You'll grow out of that.

Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?

I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.

I hoped to get enough to cover them before they cleared. I wasn't lucky.

It's the only pose I have left. I'm sunk. Broke. I don't even have my hotel bill.

I didn't mean it that way  I'm sorry.

He's a little unhappy.  I hope he wasn't a nuisance?

It wasn't much more than a pot boiler.Suez was very important for our generation.  I didn't want it to be forgotten.  And that's why I'd like to be able to help you. But really Mr. Penfield, I looked through my notes before you came, they're all very much out of date, there's been so much published since.  I don't think I'm your man.

I see.  Are you a socialist, Mr. Penfield?

To Ann.

Shall we go?

How's Mary?

No.  That's terrible, Charles. What happened?

Attributed?

Personally James, I'm very excited by this new arrangement we have. It gives us direct access to literally hundreds of American collages.  Twentieth century history is a growth area over there, don't ask me why.  Your readership will be first and second year American collage students...

It's everything we wanted.  A very good read.  A terrific piece of work.  So, here's to you and Suez.

I thought it was tremendous.

Me too.

You don't trust me.

In your car

C'mon.  I don't want any Jones about this.

...an innocent interest, and found out that last year Vogue ran a series called 'Mothers and Daughters' Number seven, Anne and Susan Barrington.  Being a decent loving friend I went to the files and made a copy for you.

That's enough of that.

Delivering gossip and goodwill. It seems we'll both be doing Brighton.  Perhaps you should come too.

It might have worked.  Really.  I would have been delighted for you if it had.  But she wasn't interested.  Not my fault.

Hello.

Do you want to hear my list of English Kings and Queens?

It's that lady from Norfolk again.

What would you call it?

You weren't really interested in Suez at all.  Incredibly enough, you were interested in my wife.

And that's why you never went pro?

Gonna be some people at my house tonight.  Maybe you can make it.

Football's a man-made game.  You keep score with numbers.  But in this, there's no field, no rules, no opponent.  Just you and the wave.

Pure adrenalin, right?!  The ultimate rush.  Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump.

Talk.

You call him... right now... and tell him to let her go.

Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him?

Cole and Munoz?  I been on this case for two years.

Added to which indignity, I got three months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue-flamer fresh out of Quantico for a partner. Some quarterback punk, Johnny Unitas or something.

Good move.

Sorry.

They're like some kind of tribe. Got their own language.  You can't just walk up to these guys.  You've got to get out there.  Learn some moves.  Get into their head.  Pick up the speech.

I think you gotta hit them straight on!

The beaches are always being closed because of waste spills, right?  And surfers are territorial.  They stick mostly to certain breaks.  If we can get some hair samples, and get a match to a certain beach, we'd know which break the Ex-Presidents surf. You buyin' this?

... so I started tailing him.

I say we call it in.  Get some backup.  But you gotta do it.  Harp won't listen to me.

Nothing?

I know where they're going.

Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. I hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies.

What's goin' on?

Those are cold.

Bye.

I don't believe he did, Sir. I couldn't find a single track. Just doesn't make sense.

Billy... What the hell's wrong with you?

You've been pushing too many Pencils, Dillon. Had enough?

You don't know how much I missed this, Dutch!!! Once you get this in your blood, you never get it out!!!

Mean anything to you?

Blain...  ... Just like the others... no powder burns, no shrapnel.

I'll see you there.

Any sign of the hostages?

We've got most of the flares, frags. and two claymores just outside. Nothin's comin' close to here without trippin' on somethin'.

I'm sorry, Bull. It's never easy. He was a good soldier.

Major, you'd better take a look at this.

I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?

There's no way you could know that.

Hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet?  I am.  This is Vivian.  You two been together long?  You and Edward?

It's... it's not like that.

Who are you going after next, sir?

No.  What I have is a lot of money.

Yes.  I'm here to tell you that I've reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer.

Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?

Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?

Stolen?

Regent Beverly Wilshire.  I bet you know it.

You like being a hooker, Vivian?

So do day jobs.

What do you charge for company, Vivian?

Three hundred.

Want to know something?  I don't quite know.  I hadn't planned this.

And why do you say that?

Sounds like you've known a lot of lawyers.

Where are they?  Shopping together?

It's a very good year.

Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.

You really are a very beautiful girl.

Good morning.

Do you ever... enjoy it?

No?  Why's that?

Not... quite.

Did you buy some clothes?

I think you'll approve.

You're upset, huh?

Why not?

I thought maybe you'd like dinner.

You always been rich?

Real genuine guy.

You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.  She anything like your ex?

You asshole!  I can't believe what a --!

To meet some friends.  Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker...

One more night and you're finally rid of me.

Vivian, I've thought about this a lot.  This is the best solution.

I got tired of hating my father.

Mr. Harris, a guest of yours, is a guest of ours and shall be treated accordingly.  The young lady asked me to tell you that she is waiting for you in the lounge.

Listen, there're some major local talent inside just dying to meet you...

I'll see him alone.  Everyone knows you're my muscle.  We'll make it social.  Tell Kross I'll meet him for dinner.  Tonight if you can arrange it.

I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.

Bill, I'd like you to meet Vivian.

You're being ridiculous.

Promise me you'll read those contracts by then.

I had to call.  I jus got off the phone with James Kross.  Get this.  He wants to see you. Today.

All this because of that whore!

You spent it on drugs, didn't you?

No, let's go to work.  Okay?

Hey Kit, where do I go for the clothes?  Good stuff on <u>him</u>.

Yeah.

Yes, I'm glad you're clean but I've been calling and calling.

Yeah... I know what you mean.

It was great.

All I'm doing is feeling lousy about it.  I don't know what to do.  What do I do, Kit?

So whatta' you going to do in San Francisco?

Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money.

I want to.  For food, got it? Eat something before the wind blows you away.

<u>Housekeeping</u>.  I come to turn down the bed.

I'm -- I'm with a friend.

I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too.  Wanna see?

In fifteen minutes I can teach you everything you need to know to dine with the Queen.  First, as you pick up the knife you shift your fork to the left hand.

What is with you?

He is a sailor on the pirate ship "Revenge." Promise to return him to his ship.

Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear.

Brides often are, I'm told.

And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness.

I never said he was my dearest love. And yes, he will save me. That I know.

He knows I do not love him.

Rest, Highness.

... as ... you ... wish...

Farm Boy. Fill these with water --  --please.

I fear I'll never see you again.

But how can you be sure?

Singed a bit, were you?

We did it.

Oh, Westley, darling.  Westley, why won't you hold me?

Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?

I did that on purpose. I don't have to miss.

We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.

Why is that, do you think?

Once the horse reaches the castle, the fabric will make the Prince suspect the Guilderians have abducted his love. When he finds her body dead on the Guilder frontier, his suspicions will be totally confirmed.

No more rhymes now, I mean it.

Give her to me.  Catch up with us quickly.

I don't think more than ten.

To find the Man in Black, obviously.

Have you any money?

Inigo -- there's more than thirty --

You've been mostly dead all day.

Don't pester him, he's had a hard day.

It doesn't sound too bad. I'll try and stay awake.

Westley didn't reach his destination. His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left captives alive. When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered --

Oh no. No, please.

You read that wrong. She doesn't marry Humperdinck, she marries Westley. I'm just sure of it. After all that Westley did for her, if she does not marry him, it wouldn't be fair.

Westley's only faking, right?

Who gets Humperdinck?

Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At the end, somebody's got to do it. Is it Inigo? Who?

No! I'm okay. I'm okay.  -- sit down. All right?

-- and then my tongue, I suppose. I killed you too quickly the last time, a mistake I don't mean to duplicate tonight.

I could never cause you grief; consider our wedding off.  You returned this Westley to his ship?

Now, where is that secret knot? It's impossible to find.  Are you coming down into the Pit? Westley's got his strength back. I am starting him on The Machine tonight.

Who are you? -- Are we enemies? Why am I on this wall? -- Where's Buttercup? --

Why? You can't even lift one.

You know, it's very strange -- I have been in the revenge business so long, now that it's over, I don't know what to do with the rest of my life.

What? What?

Look, I'm retired. And besides, why would you want someone the King's stinking son fired? I might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle.

Sixty-five.

He's dead. He can't talk.

Now, mostly dead is slightly alive. Now, all dead...well, with all dead, there's usually only one thing that you can do.

Humiliations galore!

I could do that. In fact, I've got some rope up here. But I do not think that you will accept my help, since I am only waiting around to kill you.

I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.

You don't know any way you'll trust me?

Do you always begin conversations this way?

Well, I certainly hope you find him, someday.

You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you.

You are wonderful!

You're amazing!

Who are you?!

Go in, get after her!

Yes.

Wait till I get going! Where was I?

What's so funny?

You guessed wrong.

-- get back, witch --

A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help --

Yeah, an hour.

Think it'll work?

You are sick, that's why he's here.

Yes.  Dopey show-girls in gooey gowns.  Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn- turn-kick-turn!  It's enough to make you throw up!  At last a chance to do straight drama!  To deal with conflict, with inner truth.  Roger De Bris presents history.  Of course, I think we should add a little music.  That whole third act has got to go. They're losing the war.  It's too depressing.  We'll have to put something in there.  Aaahghhh!  I see it!  A line of beautiful girls, dressed as Storm Troopers, black patent leather boots, all marching together... Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn-turn- kick-turn!

"Of the silvery mooooon,

They come here.  They all come here. How do they find me?

It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud.  If they found out, you could go to prison.

Help!

I'm not going to jump on you!

What kind now, Leo?

Maybe you're happy.

I'll tell you what's happening. We've struck gold.  Not fool's gold, but real gold.  The mother lode.  The mother lode.  The mother of them all.

Max, I don't want to take any Siegfried Oath.  I don't know what it is, but I don't want to take it. We might end up in the German Army.

There it is... in red and white! "Springtime For Hitler," signed, sealed and delivered.  What's the matter with you?

Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's not true.

I never should have listened to you.

Here.  Buy bullets.  Kill.  Kill them all!

They are?  Have you ever eaten with one?  Liebkind, go!  Kill!

I vas vit him a great deal, you know.

Wait.  No.  How do I know I can trust you?  How do I know you vill present this play in the manner and spirit in vhich it vas conceived?

Vhere?  Vhere?... oh...

Good.  Good.  We go Motel.

Don't forget the checkee.  Can't produce playees without checkees.

Until Thursday, then, you bawdy wench.

Of course, the check, I had it with me all the time.

The Blue Max...

"Deutchland, Deutchland, uber alles, Uber alles in der velt."

People can hear you.

Yes.  The actors.  I must destroy the actors.

Okay.

Hey, man, I can't do that here, that's what they put me away for.

Hey, baby, that's good!  How'd we come out?

Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days...  What was it you wanted to ask?

We have reason to believe she came this way... might have stopped in this area...  Did she stop here?

Now there's a couple even remarking about your sign, and see how easily you forgot them?

Don't know where she got "Marie," but "Samuels" figures. Her boy friend's name is Sam.  Was she in disguise? Or do you want to check the picture again?

Very early. Dawn.

No.

Now, look...!

I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable of being fooled! Not even by women!

That's all right. maybe she could have fooled me.  But...  She didn't fool my mother.

I don't know.

Someone has seen her. Someone always sees a girl with forty thousand dollars.  She is your girl friend, isn't she?

With a little checking, I could get to believe you.

You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over?  You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin' you?

Yes, Mr. Lowery.

Yes.

He didn't mention the money.  What he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!

Did he say anything about my sister?

I'm Mary's sister.

Yes... I just... did. The moment they told me...

I came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all I know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. I'd better go home.

That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.

I don't know...  One of us has to be here in case Arbogast's on the way.

He didn't come back here?

No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the old lady at home...  A sick old lady unable to answer the door... or unwilling.

Nothing.  Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.

I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.

You going to wait here for me?

What?

Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.

It's regular. Okay?

And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy! 

And besides, when you say I make tax- deductible excuses you make me out a criminal.

Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public?

A couple of years and the debts will be paid off. And if she ever re- marries, the alimony stops... and then...

How can you even think a thing like that!

Am I that close to Fairvale?

I'll be in the office if you want anything... just tap on the wall.

You're not going to go out again and drive up to that diner, are you?

Then will you do me a favor?  Will you have supper here?  I was just about to, myself... nothing more than some sandwiches and a lot of milk, but I'd like it if you'd come up to the house and... I don't set a fancy table but... the kitchen's awful homey.

You go out... with friends?

Except you.

No, not like me.

What do you mean about caring?  Have you ever seen one of those places? Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you... and my mother there?  Why? has she harmed you? She's as harmless as... one of these stuffed birds.

Thank you, Norman.

Why don't you stay a little while, just for talking.

You slept here all night?

Is anything wrong?

In the course of my duty, I never "take up" anyone's time, whether it's to give a warning, or a ticket, or help! Believe that, M'am.  Now if you woke up on the wrong side of... the car seat, that's one thing. But when you act as if I've just placed you under arrest...

Recluse. Kinder word.

Just coming up to ring for you.

I'll get your bags.

Looking for me?

Satisfied with your cabin?

I've been doing all the talking so far, haven't I?

You look frightened. Have I been saying something frightening?

Was that all?

Now wait a minute, Sam. You sure you saw an old woman?

Imagine--she was alive. What a horror. Could have been buried alive. She must have run away from the morgue.

You mean he doesn't work for you?

Thousands?

I'm detective Jones. Just dropped in to tell you a bit of news.

You here again?

Dr. Meirschultz, please.

What is it now?

You're losing your blood?

I don't have any affairs. What do you mean?

All right, you raise the kids -- I'll raise the roof. I'd rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers, than expire in a pan of dirty dish water.

He can look like a chimpanzee and act like an igorot but he must have dough -- plenty of dough.

But what about lunch?

There's no hurry. It's early.

Why, certainly, sir. My fiancée. Charlotte, may I present Mr. Igor.

Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?

If you will forgive this poor, crippled stump, my dear, I am very happy to know you.

But it was really my fault.

Please, oh, please, I haven't done anything to hurt you.

Meaning what?

All right, what about it? We get out a paper just the same. Did you ever stop to think of that?

Well, ain't that a shame. Nice little chappie that wouldn't harm a fly ... everybody picking on the little fellow.

I'm glad to hear it. When did you go in for crusading in the cause of justice? This lousy mug, with all the money in the world, has had two or three nasty affairs. He's kept out o' print because his great- grandfather was smarter than the Indians.

Except that he disappeared when things got too hot.

Hey, come here, Sob-sister!

Well, why so mysterious! Come on, spill it.

All right, Master Mind.  But there's something cockeyed about that joint and I'm going to find out what it is. 

What do you mean?

Oh, yeah? Maybe she didn't commit suicide. She may have been murdered!

Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.

Nothing. Only she may have tried to blackmail him. You know such things have happened. Anyway, he was at her apartment a few hours before she was found dead.

Don't give this to anybody else, will you?

Where'd you get the stag hound?

Listen, Flo, cut it out. Hard-Tack is pretty sore.

Fine, thanks.

He might get some publicity out of it.

Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?

Well, let's get back to the case in hand. They ordered an autopsy and discovered her body had been stolen from the morgue.

Why?

Oh, is that what caused it?

I came back for some of the books. I am trying to straighten out the accounts. I don't hope to impress you, but I may as well tell you: We haven't a farthing!

And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy.

Everything, my friend. And you hope to be a great sculptor --  A great sculptor. Look -- this forearm is at least two inches too long.

But I have some friends waiting.

Have you got it? Is it completed?

Yep. Everything settled.

To isolation.  To an armed camp.  To a biblical spoof of a crazed father firing a gun at his only son.

Two: what if I didn't miss?

Could be.

Yes?

I know, Mother.

Rose, who were those scoundrels in Birmingham?

Was that what they tried to do? Was that why Daddy gave you the job, to save you from those scoundrels?

Actually, I am, though.

You better quit that.

He's got doubts about hisself and that's the saddest thing of all. Would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him?

Oh, Buddy, they're gonna cut me all up! They're gonna cut my stummick all open, I'll die!

Hi, Buddy.  How's my sweetheart who never told on me when I was bad?

Makin' homes for purple martins, huh? We had 'em on the farm. They're the prettiest things. That's what I wish I was, a bird. Just fly around catch bugs and have a lot of fun.

Did you know when I was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits?

Son, was Rose in your room last night?

Well. Well, what I mean is, you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him. But look this, Brother, it is even more interesting. Look at this mark here, and that mark over there. Now wouldn't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder?

Your impression is very reassuring, Brother. Of course she's had troubles, poor thing, but I sensed that was that the girl was like and I'm glad to have it reconfirmed.

Uhhh, gahdam stuff!

Daddy says Rose is calm as lettuce. Do you believe that, Doll?

It's pitiful. Neither one of them know.

There goes Mother.

Let's go peep from the living room.

He had his hand on her titty.

No, Mother, he's lying...

It isn't that she hasn't got any sense, Doll. Her basic intelligence is probably above average, maybe quite a bit above average.

A baby... and she isn't even married.

Well, you rascal, where'd you come from?

About as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave. Good to see you, son.  Did you bring any of that Yankee whisky with you?

I can use a drink after the plane ride I had.

You're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. He also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over Washington. D.C.

All right, Daddy. We have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. Rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it?

Dead, Rose is dead? You mean... she died?

But... but how? She was young! Rose wasn't old!

The point is you don't grow up like that on a diet of sorghum and hominy grits. She got protein somewhere, she's a very strong girl and I think she'll live... despite the delay in medical treatment.

Well, it's a disaster. I don't know what to say, Doctor, I am floored. How dangerous is the operation?

Go ahead, Doctor, I think I am following you.

Who doesn't have such thoughts?  We'd better get going.

Well, I admit that outfit isn't very modest. But she doesn't mean any harm, she just wants to attract, attention.

I don't think you understand her. It isn't sex she wants, it's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it.

Well, she's back.

That sulky boy was here again this afternoon. I was almost scared, he wouldn't go away.

-- I am not responsible for her epizootics and I did not bring about her epizootics. Now listen to me. When I have to get up in the middle of the night and defend my home with a shotgun against a couple of damned scoundrels fistfighting in the bushes --

Boys? You say to me boys?

I don't intend to fire her, darlin'.

It's because of the children she's got to go. I don't want to be holier-than-thou, but the girl doesn't have the same outlook we do. Morals don't mean a thing to her, not a thing, and we can't have a girl like that in this house.

That is exactly what I'm afraid of.  The girl has got to go, darlin'.

She hasn't actually done anything...

It has been three weeks since I "fired" her. Is there no way to get rid of this girl? Are we stuck with her for life?

She does look a little peaky.

You're not going to get anywhere with that line of questioning. The problem is, what are we going to do?

How is she?

Why, that looks like Dave Wilkie,

Well, thank God we are rid of her at last. And the best thing of all is that she's happy. The little nut is happy, she found Mr. Right in the nick of time!

Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens.

What have you got in your hair, girl?

Strange voices, Rose?

Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see...

Galley what?

I don't want to start no fight with you, Buddy. Why do you say I'm full of shit?

Well, Mrs. Hillyer, the girl is strong as an ox and that is what is keeping her alive. But not many people walk away from double pneumonia, Madam, not many.

It's simply that I find it incredible, Mr. Hillyer. Aside from the girl's illness at the moment, she is very strong, a very healthy specimen of a young human female -- and a comely one, too. She must have gotten protein somewhere as a young child, if only sporadically.

I'm sorry the truth nauseates you, Mrs. Hillyer, because before you leave there's a bit more of it I'd like to put to you. This operation provides a therapeutic opportunity that I feel is quite important in regard to this particular girl, who suffers not only from an ovarian cyst but from a certain psychoneurotic condition as well.

I will not cry like a woman. If I'm upset it's because of what my husband said, not because of you. You can't make me cry like a woman, a woman has got just as much intelligence and self-control as a man. And you get this in your head. If you hurt that girl, I'll hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got, I'll do my level best to ruin you. Do you understand me?

Are you going to get your degree soon?

Yes, Ma'am.

I don't want to go to the dentist.

Well, there's no reason you shouldn't go out, Rose... in moderation.

Rose, you don't look well and you haven't eaten a bit of breakfast.

Oh-h, Mrs. Hillyer, I... I can't think. I... I'm not really sure.

You'll never guess what happened!  I have met Mr. Right! I been with him all day and he loves me, I know he does, he loves me and he's going to marry met Be's practi'cly ast me already!

I... I can explain...

What... what makes you think you can order me around?!

You think it's that good?

A Lincoln?  What Lincoln?  Lincoln Continental?  Lincoln Mark Five... Six... ?

Take her down to the car, and for Christ's sake be careful this time.  Last suspect he took in, butter-fingers dropped her down the stairs.  What a mess.  Why is it we don't appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?

You're Zimmermann's calculator, Archie.  All the blood money you had to move around to make this deal, you got to know something.  Maybe they told you, maybe you overheard things you weren't supposed to hear...

How's your precious little school-marm today?

She's right.  If you two are doing the horizontal polka, the last thing you want is a thirty-five pound bundle-of-joy stumbling around, knocking over furniture and calling you "daddy."

Make a hole, Billy-Boy.

Jiminy Christmas.

No offices are gonna be open today.

The ones you got in that fist-fight with a couple a weeks ago... ?

Wh... what... ?!

Dean Martin.

You been wearing rubbers, Billy-Boy?

Smooth move, hot-shot.

Where we going?

No, we're stealing.

Bad news is, word's spreading like wildfire that we don't have badges, and nobody wants to end up getting splattered like Butch Cassidy either.

You could start over again with cash like that.

Our resignations.

He went to pick up lunch.

What can we do for you, officers? What new, mindless harassments have you planned this morning?

Couldn't have said it better myself.

Thanks, but we don't recognize "brunch" as an actual meal.

Look out!  Jupiter and Saturn'll get you every fucking time.

I just think you should show some respect.  I mean, call me old fashioned, but 200 years ago when Ben Franklin and those guys signed the Constitution and Declaration of Independence, they did that so we could all share in the freedom...

"Go, go, go!"  "Slow down."  Make up your mind.

I'm gonna get beside.  Nena, you're gonna shoot out his tires.

You put your bumper just behind his left tire and then accelerate... make him spin out...

What... ?  Not you too?

You need a doctor.

If it is, that's pretty high up on the totem pole.  What do you think?

Alright... how about you two hit the strip and start knocking some heads together?  Find out who "A.D." is.  I got a quick errand to run.

You're... you're not doing what I think you're doing... ?

All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.

We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.

We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.

But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.

Jabba's palace.

The Death Star will be completed on schedule.

Wouldn't miss it.

Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?

You got her warmed?

I thought she was with you.

Shall we try and go around?

I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.

It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.

That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.

I'm going in.

Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!

He's my father.

Then you know why I have to face him.

No, you don't. You've always been strong.

The Emperor has been expecting you.

You cannot hide forever, Luke.

Master Yoda, you can't die.

Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet.  Janet.

Like this.  Like how?  It's your fault - you're to blame.  I thought it was the real thing.

I see.  So this wasn't simply a chance meeting.  You came here with a purpose.

He might be.  I don't know.

It's as if we were glued to the spot.

So please don't tell me to can it.

Janet.

Uh huh.

Oh Brad, I'm mad.

Oh, Brad.  Let's go back.  I'm cold and I'm frightened.

Oh Brad, I'm frightened.  What kind of place is this?

Oh....Say something.

Then ask the butler - or someone.

Hello.

Good God.

Yes, well perhaps it was for the best.

You beast, you monster, what have you done with Brad?

Promise you won't tell Brad.

"Sweet Transvestite"

"Transylvania"

Want to come again and stay

Oh, no no, no no.

Are you - giving a party?

...How's the turtle food this week?

...Aren't you skating?

I would say you're very shy by nature.

...I'm at least half a bum. Yeah, fightin' is a crazy racket. The roughest part is the mornin' after.

You sure?

What's the problem? You don't like me -- Don't like the turtles -- What is it?

Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine?

Is everything all right?

...I dunno.

Shutup! I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!

You busted?!

I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong.

...That boy damn near broke my arm.

Man, I rearranged his face with that right -- The people love what's happenin' tonight.

No doctor!

Me an' my wife are goin' home 'cause we miss our children an' can't go no more time without seein' them.

Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards like the zoo.

Kiss my ass.

Hey, whatta ya doin' here -- we're closed... Yo, we're closed!

Seven minutes!

Cost ya a buck.

Here -- Three minutes.

That's ten bucks.

Apollo almost sprints out of his corner -- feints and throws a pair of left-right combinations. Balboa drops beneath a left upper cut and lands a very solid shot on Creed's temple -- not much movement from Balboa, duck a left, a right, another left and explodes with a right hook to the temple -- I mean explodes. The Champ backs off.

Don't hit the face! Not the face!!

A hundred an' thirty.

Ya still light seventy.

Buddy's in a bad mood -- prostate problems.

Buddy's got a thing against ya, Rock. Some people just hate for no reason, y'know.

Sure, you do what ya want. Stay away from the stock market.

Hello, Mr. Balboa -- I'm Miles Jergens -- Please, have a seat.

What?

Did you hear what I said?

Did these guys teach you to talk dirty? Huh?

That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it.

Listen, I hope ya don't --

Then stand there an' wait till I'm done -- Creed's good, yeah, he's real fine but I gotta boy, y'know Big Dipper, who's got the stuff it takes to be a champ -- He's mean, quick, an' big -- What more d'ya need? Okay, go to work...  Hey -- Yeah -- Whatta ya want?

Dipper's a climber -- You're a tomato.

Hey, ever think about retirin'?

Think about it.

'Bout an hour ago.

Look at all them other fighters. Real good boys. Good records. Colorful. Fight their hearts out for peanuts -- But who cared? Nobody. They got it shoved in their back door. Nobody ever give them a shot at the title...

...What?

If ya was wantin' my help, why didn't ya ask? Just ask.

What cha say, Benny -- Meet 'The Rock.' This is our cutman, Benny Stein.

God bless ya, Rock.

Gimme the water! Ya gettin' tagged with his right. I think you should feint left and high hook 'im -- Benny, check the eyes! Can ya see?

Yo, Mike -- What's happenin' here?

Yeah, like I was a plate of leftovers -- Somethin' wrong with my face -- Whatta I need, a Caddy to connect with ya sister?

I usta be deadly at half-ball.

What kinda business?

I don't need a doctor, I need a different job.

Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a friend an' would do a good job... Tell him I ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... Bustin' bones don't bother me -- Tell him I'm a good worker.

How 'bout you talk to 'em about me?  Please do me that favor.

To see ya train.

And another thing, the paper said no will was found.  But every Toon knows Acme had a will and, in it he promised to leave Toontown to the Toons.

Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it, Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'.

So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie? Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a <u>dame</u> who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump.  And it was a <u>dame</u> who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would.  And it's a <u>dame</u> who's tired of waitin' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job!

This is fifty bucks.  I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.

Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.

Do you think the rabbit did it?

Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages.

So you're not even gonna bother to find out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?

Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.

I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's called here about four times.  He says he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He says he can help you.

Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.

They must've taken it off me.

Take it easy, Bongo.  We'll handle Mr. Valiant our own way... downtown.

I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me Santino.

I don't think it's gonna matter. Sorry, pal, I tried.

A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another.

Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?

Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?

Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.

It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?

What's with the dip?

Maroon?  Whaddaya want?

My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get yourself a quickie divorce.

Aah!

How do you know that?

Hey, don't I get an encore?

Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'. Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the noodle, the grey matter...

So what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi?

You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked you for the patsy.  Always gotta play the fool.  You make me sick!

You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.

I'll get it.

Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over.

Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?

Your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure.

A challenge, on my life.

Keep away the cats! Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says, &quot;God send me no need of thee.&quot; and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.

Out--

Good heart, at what?

Farewell, my cuz.

What dares the slave Come hither, To fleer and scorn at our solemnity? Now, by the stock and honour of my kin, To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.

'Tis he.

My poverty, but not my will consents.

Drink it off and, if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight.

That's my good son: but where hast thou been

There is no world without Verona walls, hence banished is banished from the world and worlds exile is death. Then banished is death mis-termed. Calling death banished, thou cu'st my head off with a golden axe and smiles upon the stroke that murders me.

Where is my Lady's lord?

I bade her come. God forbid! Juliet! Juliet! Juliet!

Juliet!

O honey nurse, what news? Nurse?

But all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that?

I have.

I take thee at thy word.

Do not swear: although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to-night: It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night! This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night.

By my count, I was your mother much upon these years, You are now a maid. Thus then in brief: The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.

Too great oppression for a tender thing.

Why, may one ask?

O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you. She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate-stone On the fore-finger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies Over men's noses as they lie asleep; Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat, And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees, Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again. This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage: This is she--This is she!

A most courteous exposition.

Mercutio! Thou art consortest with Romeo?

Good king of cat's, nothing but one of your nine lives.

If ye should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say: for the lady is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing, and very weak dealing.

Nurse.

We kept it...

I don't know.

You go shoot me if you want, Vincent, but you'll be dead before I hit the ground.

Only the stupid ones.  Cigarettes kill more patriots than bullets.  Besides, I'm not IRA no more.

So what's the deal?

Then Swede and I split with the package and meet you back at the rendezvous.

Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for me, thanks.

When we're done with this, I want to do for that one myself.

From Interpol?

You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head...

Part of me says I should just look at this as a perk.  You know, a bonus.  But then I remember you're you -- Deirdre who used to belong to the IRA -- and it occurs to me that deceit and subterfuge come very naturally to you.

Now, what did we steal?

Who are you?  IRA?

Go ahead, shoot... Shoot and kill the bitch, I don't care.  And yet you don't shoot.  Interesting. Put down your weapon and walk away.

And more importantly --

What am I doing here?  Why, I'm here to see my partners, Gregor, the boys in the Russian Mafia.  See, your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross.  But they only just found out that what's in the briefcase is completely useless without me.  I can't fight them, and they can't kill me -- that means we're gonna have to do business together.

So what do we do?

Then I guess we're set.

So this is what, a test?

So what is it you want to know?

All in the stomach, though.  Your man might live.

Yeah, well...  My way works too.

It's a cocktail.  Mostly demerol, cut with a little crank because we might need you awake in the real near future.

What're you talking about, man?  I don't understand.

You should watch what you eat.

I'm just worried about your health, Larry.  You could stand to shed a few pounds.

Is that right?

I'm Vincent.  And I coordinate.

He says this is their block.

I didn't know that you spoke French.

That was a nice move you did on our young friend.  Judo?

Help yourself.  Since when do you smoke?

Watch that one, he's an ex-spook for sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB.  He's smart, Gregor is.

What's going on?

You don't.  You just learn to live with it.

He's going back.

Fix it yourself?  Why are we even doing this?  There's no need to run, Christ...  You're a cop.

I'm going with you.

Alright, it's done.

You know him?

Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.

You were behind the door?

You would have done that?

What the fuck happened?

Not here.  They might see it.

Not just like that... Just before I turn around and it's six months from now and the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is light a cigarette.

Tell me something first.  The package: what was it?

You slept with her!

You put everything on the line because you...

Do you have the tape?

Can you get it?

I should kill you right here! I never thought you'd do this to me but I guess there's a lot I didn't know about you!

What the hell...

It's no accident we stumbled on this money.  It's an answer to a prayer!  Every night and every day I've prayed that God would just -- help me out a little, give me a little push.  Tonight my prayer came true.

That's right!

We're going to be patient. If we start flashing money around, buying fancy cars and fancy clothes, people are going to ask questions.

Shhh!

Okay then.  I'll do it.

I don't know you want me to put on my cape and fly there?!  We're going to play it cool... besides there might be nothing on that tape anyway...

No we didn't.  He died on his own.

Shit!  We're gonna have to get rid of him.  I'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life.  We can't risk it.

That's not what I mean.

I could kill that no good son of a bitch!

Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls.

And how do you figure we do that?

He's going to be trouble.

You said that last time!

You're out of your mind.

Look, Earl.  We gotta go straight. This is all messed up...

You're crazy.

How long is it going to take?!

Jesus Christ Earl...what are we doing?...

Maybe we should say somethin'.

I don't know.  They got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.

Oh Jesus...

You're the one who's nuts! There's no one left to touch us, Booth.  We're home free!  We just plant a little of the money on Dwayne, and it's all ours.

And you're solid on that?

I'm all ears.

There's going to have to be a change in our arrangement.

I don't like getting grilled by that DEA bitch, I don't like taking that kind of heat!

Come on, Booth.  Don't let him do this!!!

Let's not get into this again. I know him.  If you said something, he'd take it out on me.

And I'd end up a widow in two ways.  Let's forget it.  I'll just be a little more careful next time.

He started digging through my closet, something he never does.

Every night I think about you sleeping with him, him slobbering all over you.

We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...

So do I.

Yeah, I've seen him.

Test the product?

All right, deputies, take care, don't let your meat loaf.

Why?

What makes you say that?

Maybe.  Maybe not.

Oh that was Agent Wallace.  We're going to check into something.

Dwayne...  It is imperative that we keep this confidential.	Now we know someone's out there.  Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.

Some of it.  Denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.

Shopping here?

Very clumsy, very clumsy.  Id have found it in a minute.

About what?

Something wrong, Jesse?

You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.

It was going to be a surprise!

No, Dwayne, you go ahead and relax, have a six pack and fall asleep in front of the TV, and come upstairs and pass out.  And do it all over again tomorrow!

I'll settle for a third of that.

We're out of here.

I'm not asking.

I don't suppose you'll tell us where the tape is.

Don't hurt me.

People have been asking me about that story in the paper.  I told them you were the first person on the scene.  They were asking me for all the details.

Well what do you know!  An air conditioner.

You want to hear the good news first, or the bad news?

But nowhere near three million dollars worth.  I would say maybe twenty thousand.

That fire was set.  Deliberately. And probably not by anyone found at the scene.

Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?

Wait.

Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong Kong, James.

Jail!?  James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.

Look, I need some info and I don't have time to play around.

How'd you know?

What?

You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for obstruction.

Let's go.  I've got girls and chicken and hot oil waiting for me.

You get massage from Chinese girl before?

Wait a second.  You're Steven Reign? You're big time.  You own all them big hotels.  What are you doing in Hong Kong?

All I did was invite them for a drink.

Of course not.  My Superindendent invited us to a club tonight.  Big party.

I'm sorry.

No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.

And that's how you use the LAPD choke hold.  Now start practicing and don't make me come back here!

What are you doing?

What's wrong?

I have plenty of dates.

You would never understand my life. You're not Chinese.

Carter?

What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?

Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.

I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.

I should go back.  Ricky Tan mentioned a boat in Hong Kong Harbor...

How do you know he's our man?

Just tell me where I can find this Steven Reign.

She's getting undressed.

Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.

Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs?

Wait!  There's people down there!

Get it out of here!

I wouldn't do that!!!

Let me see it again?

She saved our lives.

What's a Chinese heaven?

How was the sex?

Steamed dumplings?

That's rough, man.  If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.

Are you serious?

Very nice.

Hello, Benjamin.

You could never kick my ass.  You mama's boy.

Vegas...

What is Mac out?

Couple?  No, you got it wrong, there's no couple here.  Just two single police officers working a very dangerous case.

Isabella?  Are you crazy, man?  She almost got us killed.  She's setting you up again!

Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in your mouth?

Lee, wait a second.  It's not worth it, man.  He's making you do this.

I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.

No, Carter.  I can't take this.

Quite a night, Inspector.  Ricky Tan was our only bait, and now he's gone.  You finally got your revenge - at the expense of a U.S. Government investigation.

I know who you are, Inspector Lee.

Behind me is the soft count room.  We're pretty sure the plates are back there.

Are you okay?

I didn't know which side you were on.

Master Ching taught me.

Lee, there was a bombing at the American Embassy.  Two American translators were killed.

We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand.

Escort Detective Carter to the airport --

... if your father were alive, I would be turning to him now.  I didn't blow up the American Embassy, but I believe some of my people did.  My enemies are trying to frame me.  There is a war going on within the Triads -- and I am going to lose.  My name has been written into the book of death.

You don't move, you understand?!  You don't move!

Good job.

Feds asked for me?

And that, of course, would be me.

Help me Rhonda.

Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit.

I am afraid I don't understand the importance of this information.

The license!  You get it?!

It was my ass that almost got trashed!

When a man steps in dung, it is obvious.  There is no need to rub it in his face.  The smell is the same.

I worked with Ambassador Han and his family for ten years.  He wanted me to come with them to America.  If I had, this might not have happened.

You like it?

You want more?

You know War?

Which one?

This is my territory now.  You are my responsibility.

Like that.

No, wait.  I don't have it.  You have it.

Oh no, I dropped it.

Oh no.

No, it is China, my country, my history.  If any of it gets damaged...

Oh my god. Griffin.

You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI!

This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find em.

Yeah, if you're Superfly.

Hmmmm?

Okay, look, we're gonna make a trade. You cross the street, leave her on the sidewalk.  I will leave him on this side.  Then we trade places.  You get him, I get her.  Get the picture, Lois?

Yes.

Yes.

I am so sorry about your men.

What is he up to now?

At the wedding?  You invite him?  Bob, don't you realize he's writing another article about me?

You don't understand this guy.

Right.

How could I be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as God intended?

"Nothing but net."

Fully.  I like her.  She has wit.

Lesson number two.  Never work for your former spouse.

No, that's what makes you unemployed.

Lawyers.  I don't know, Ellie -- Firing me is going to be very tough on you.  It's going to be hard to get over.  There will be therapy bills for you.

See?  You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?

Fisher, let him talk.

If she runs, then it's a cover story. All true.  All accurate.

Then you've got it.  If you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands, you'll have plenty of time before her next wedding trot.

Justice, yes.  Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.

Yeah.

Of course we are.  Of course.

Get this man a Kamikaze.

I don't know.  I'm working on it.  I was on the wrong track.

I'm not sure.  Mr. Schullian runs the newsstand, he's our local bookie, you know, he's giving eight to one odds she won't.  He says she's so famous now, maybe Vegas will give odds on her.  I'm going to wait to hear what the pros say.

Well, I'm off.  A reporter's work is never done.  Mrs. Pressman, thank you.

Have you listened to his morning show, "Wake up with ballplayer"?

It's nice that they're still friends.

Like her mother.

Dad's fishing trip, Grandma's knee operation, Grandma's birthday...

I'm not here to make you feel bad.  I'm here for vindication.  In my heart...

Give me that!

You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her?

Too much.

It's a little "Silence of the Lambs" for me.  I can't believe you waited for the wedding to run.

It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life.  Cal Ripken even applauded.

No.

Watch your leg, Dad.  I'm so tired of this.

Are you all right with this?  You think this is funny?

I'm the only goddamn person in there pulling for you.

No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing.  It's the theme of this party.

Brian told you that?

Livid is good.  So what is it, Maggie? You here on business?  I saw your lamps. They're terrific.

You actually could make breaking and entering into a new career.  So, what are you doing here?

You were not.

So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh?

Because you think I'm all like... "Hey man, check me out".

But I'm weird.

I'm not worried about you and Cory or Cory and me or even that you're irreversibly screwed up.  But, Maggie, you've been like this since we were kids.  And I think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people's feelings, maybe it's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own, like Bob, if he's the one.

What happened at the luau?

You and your lucky geese.  You always see geese.

Let's go.

Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?

What are you talking about?

Thank you.  You still think that he was....

So I've come to see it as a bonus, really, that we've been able to plan, and pay for, so many weddings.

"What is unusual about Miss Carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them.  She has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar."... I can't ready anymore.

Boats.  All anyone talks about is the wind.  Is it up, is it down.  I can't live with a man who only talks about the wind.

But it's on the water.

I hope I don't have to pay for that piece of information.

Harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back --

And your brother Tom is a psychology professor and is married to...Betsy --

Am I what they had in mind?

If he eats one tiny piece of a nut --

Is that all right with you?

They loved you.  I told you they would love you and they did.

I love you, Walter.  Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter?

When you get back, I'll be gone --

Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just...

I told you.  Nothing --

I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here.

You okay?

It's not true, but it feels true.

You want to hear about destiny? If my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him, I would never have been on that flight to Miami, and met Rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says "vacant-occupied, vacant- occupied, vacant-occupied" -- 

He lost all the weight... there.

Plus he fell in love with a temp.

Okay.  Good.  Goodbye.

You were standing in the middle of the street?

This is a photo of hair.

"Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter.  It was great.  We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle."

No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice --

Please --

Howard.

Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much better just having blown this off.

I notice these things are back in fashion.  Oh, honey.  He's a lovely man, Annie.

It's silly, really.  I mean, I'd seen him at the office, obviously I'd seen him, he's the associate publisher, and then one day we both ordered sandwiches from the same place, and he got my lettuce and tomato sandwich on whole wheat, which of course he was allergic to, and I got his lettuce and tomato on white.

Why not?

Why not?

I'm sorry to hear that, Jonah.

No.

Hey, my plate is full.

Well.  Things are different. First, you have to be friends. You have to like each other. Then you neck.  This can go on for years.  Then you have tests.  Then you get to do it with a condom.  The good news is, split the check.

Great.  They'll have a parade in your honor.  You'll be Man of the Year in Seattle Magazine.  Tira misu.

You'll find out.

Somewhere in the middle.

Will she scratch up your back?

Our house.  There was water coming in all the windows.

I'm starting to forget her.

This is a good letter, Dad.

Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.

It's a sign.

Here is Seattle.  And here is Baltimore.  Case closed. 

There's a bathroom upstairs.

Long enough to call Victoria a ho.

The reason I know this and you don't is that I'm younger and purer so I'm more in touch with cosmic forces.

I have to have a life.  I have to do things that I want with people my own age.  It's none of your business who I am going out with.  I don't give a good goddam if you're angry --

I mean, so far, have I screwed it up for you?

What about camping?

Do you like it?

You saw her in the airport and then here?

Oh.

You haven't tried locking them up!

Now why don't you let these gentlemen pass? Don't you know who's in that car?

Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.

Now wait a minute. Super's the one made the rule. He ain't gonna give you no helper.

Are you sick, Mama?

Come on, Esperanza -- how about it? We got to.

Forget it.

Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself?

Stop it! The children are watching. Stop it!

You are no good to me -- in jail.

NO, she wants to be there.  And there's Mrs. Kalinsky.

Anglo husbands can also be backward.

Tell me.

When?

It's a lot to them. They'd do anything to open that mine.

Yes. I talk of dignity. The Anglo bosses look down on you, and you hate them for it. "Stay in your place, you dirty Mexican" -- that's what they tell you. But why must you say to me, "Stay in your place." Do you feel better having someone lower than you?

We can't think of them just as housewives -- but as allies. And we've got to treat them as such.

Aw, cut it out, Ruth.

Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions.

Go on. Spill it.

That's all right -- it's no secret. My name's Hartwell. I'm from the company's Eastern office.

What are you doing here?  Something wrong with Mama?

The Junior Shop Stewards. There's lots of ways we can help.

Ramón ... listen to me ... I'm in a	jam ... I had to get a job ...

Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. Rhymes with Simmy.

What can I do for you?

Ride 'em cowboy)

Who wouldn't?

Could be worse.  Oh sorry, forgot who I was talking to.

What?

Go ahead.

It's not that easy.

I can't.

Then make sure he gets put away for longer.

How far out of town?

Miles Davis. "All Blues."

I'm kind of busy.

We been through that.

Really, I don't want to.

You're good, princess. I'll give you that.

Is that what you want me to do?  Put it all on Jesus?  Let him sort it out in the afterlife?

Maybe I am dealing with it.

How the hell did we get this detail?

Where to?

That's a good one.

Yeah, that's what I mean.  Where the hell does this guy live anyway?

Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?

You want a hit?

What does J.F.K. stand for?

But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight.

Jimmy, look, there's something I have to tell you.

But... why? Why would you pretend?

You don't trust me?

Wait  If you don't trust me, why did you tell me that stuff about not using drugs?

Yeah, I uh, have a buyer who's looking for about a quarter's worth.

Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.

But I just met you.

Come on, guys ...

Don't address me.  I didn't make the accusation.

CAN I PULL MY FUCKING DICK OUT?!

What the hell is this?

I've got a hot one.

Feeling the paranoia tonight, are we?

Don't you wonder why I do it?

You better not be blowing smoke up My ass, Flynne.

Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is.

Took a pig-slicker to the heart.

Danny, it's really pains me to have to tell you this, but do you remember DOMINGO, that wetback you helped us put away for trafficking a few months back?

What's on the other end of this thing?

Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne.

Excuse me?

Speaking of which ... you run that license plate for me?

Really?

You mean like the Donner Party?

But that's okay, Liz, you're the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills. I'm just an unemployed musician.  You have every right.

Resistance?

So, where are you from?

As a matter of fact, I am.

If we find Ryan and he's still alive, that son-of-a-bitch is gonna carry this goddamned B.A.R. back to the beach for me.

He ain't half-bad, I guess.

Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.

Captain, my feet are most uncomfortable.  If I'd 'a known we was gonna have to walk all the way to Ramelle, I never would 'a volunteered for this here mission.

Reiben, I want you to listen closely to Jackson.  This is the way to gripe. Jackson, continue.

I'm in my backyard, lying in my hammock, with my arm around my wife, listening for the sound of breaking glass.

You can tell all that, just by the sound, sire?

But you could have gotten killed and I...

Upham?

It looks like a Renoir.

Over three-hundred.

If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.

Five nights ago, he found this paratrooper caught in a tree with a broken leg.  The leg got infected. Last night he went to Ville Cholet to get a doctor.  The doctor refused to come and when he got back, this is what he found.  The Krauts must have shown up while he was gone.

I'd like to stay, too, Captain.

I can tell what the gunners had for dinner.

What about our grenades?

Upham, you've got to learn the difference between whining and griping.  You can't just rely on natural ability, you've got to study and practice.

Captain, what about our deal?

Caen?

Don't let yourself get killed, if you do, they might make me give back the medal and then I won't be able to lip off to colonels anymore.

Sarge, see what you can do to make those buildings inhospitable.

What do you think?

What are we going to do?

Uh, oh.

There's a war on, good chance they're not still making lingerie in Caen.

Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're the best.

Captain, I gotta tell you, the irony of this mission is fucking killing me.

I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off?  And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead.

Well, maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us have mothers.

Reiben, what's the matter with you? I don't gripe to you.  I'm a captain. There's a chain of command.  Griping goes one way, up, only up, never down.  You gripe to me, I gripe to my superior officers.  Up, get it? I don't gripe to you, I don't gripe in front of you.  How long you been in the army?

No, sir.

Looks like they've been having a hell of a party, here, Captain.

You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules.

Leave him to me, Captain, I'll have him pissing and moaning with the best of us.

Cocks his Thompson.  Settles down behind some sandbags.

Thank you, sir.

Yes, sir.

Don't do that again.

Doesn't move.  He just stares at Sarge's body.

Jackson was from West Fork, Tennessee, he was going to be a preacher, his father and uncles have a traveling ministry out of the back of a stretch Hudson.

So what?  I've got three satchel charges, six gammon grenades, a dozen- and-a-half pineapples, and all my regular gear.  You don't hear me complaining.

Who cares?

But everybody's heard of him, he won the Congressional Medal of Honor, he saved a dozen men.

Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.

No, I'm not married.  It's for my daughter.

Why do you eat that stuff?  There's no food in your food.  Not too loud, the red line's there for a reason.

Gee, it's easy.

I'll be in my office.

That's not even a scam.

Then what's love?

C'mon, just do it.

Please?

So, what's your point?

No, you're not a guy.

The world is full of guys.  Be a man.  Don't be a guy.

Did you see what Mr Carroll wrote in my yearbook?  Well, he ridiculed me all year long, and then he writes, "You're a real live-wire, Love Mr Carroll."  Y'know, it's all so phoney.

Lloyd is doomed.

And I want to turn the home over to the state.

I'll put this past my boss

Lloyd, she's being difficult.

Alright, no more, I'm going to save it.

Dad, you have to teach me to suture this weekend.

God, that's... this is ridiculous.

Goodnight.

Well, let me start it.  I'm flying down to Los Angeles on business, and I decide to take her on her first aeroplane.

You bet you should have called.  You still live at home.  Don't make me call the police at three-thirty in the morning, don't make me call hospitals.

Do you love him?

Dad, in a million years, I would never give him a pen.  What's wrong with having some fun?  I like him.

That's right, work it out.

Take it easy how mad you make me, I'm the only dad you've got.

Mom, please?

I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad.

No noise, no sound, no movement, nothing!  Hello, Diane?

So you're monumentally busy?

I'll go.

Alright.  This is really great.  Alright, we're going out. It's a date.  It's a scam.  Whatever, whatever, alright, I'll pick you up at what, eight O' clock?

So we can finally talk?

Have a good sleep.

Yeah, but I feel like I fit in for the first time, you know? Like I just held them far away from me, and they did the same to me.

Thanks.  But either way it still feels...

You're a great date.  I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you.

I only have something like sixteen weeks.

Boy, this is a mother dictionary.

Nice one.

Oh.

After work?

Me?  Sure I do.

Okay, bye.

Yeah.  With potential.

Yeah.  Now, when you feel like you're confident,...

Yeah, a little bit.  Listen, this is important.  When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.

You shared it with a dick.

Is this because of your dad?

Did you talk to Corey?

She figured it out.  I'm sorry if that upsets you.

Okay.

Man, all you gotta do is find a girl who looks just like her, nail her, and then dump her man, get her off your mind.

It's your castle, man.

Hey man, I was in love once.  I got hurt really bad.  I never wanna go through that again.

You're freaking out here man.

YEAH!

PAIN!

Jim Court?

Sorry, Diane isn't here at the moment.

Okay, I'll give here the message.

Hello.  Heard about that graduation present.  Really quite a car. Look, I know you're busy, you don't' have to retain me, but you can trust me.  I'll tell you a couple of things about myself, I'm nineteen, been overseas for a couple of semesters, but now I'm back.  I'm an athlete, so I rarely drink.  Kickboxing.  You heard of kickboxing, sport of the future?  Don 'The Dragon' Wilson, Lenny [?] merciless, one of the champions of the sport?  I can see by your face, no.  My point is, you can relax because your daughter will be safe with me for the next seven to eight hours.

Thanks Lloyd.

Seriously, Lloyd.

Hi, Lloyd.  This is my eighth and final call...

I know.

"You can't know the horrible disappointment I feel..."

Stop freaking with her head man.  Just stop playing with her mind, you know?  She's a human being.  She's a person.  She's very talented, you know.

My car.

Don't make this like a counsel, Lloyd. I got statistics I can show you, I got graphs I can show you.  That's all the stuff I can show you, it all says the same thing.  You have to decide on a career.

It's gotta stay purple.  All night.  Hey Lloyd, how ya doin'?

I love you man.

Nothing's changed.  Then again, something has changed, hasn't it?

He's essential.  Without him, everything comes to a grinding halt.  If that happens -

Well, let's find him.

You know what, you'd like her.

Luck.

All right, okay, let's talk.

Do you have any idea what's involved? The paperwork alone?  Forget you got to build it all, getting the fucking permits, that's enough to drive you crazy.  Then the engineers show up.  They stand around and they argue about drainage - I'm telling you, you'll want to shoot somebody, I've been through it, I know.

If you admit to making three, then it's four, actually.  But how?

What's that?

The SS beat me up.  They would have killed me, but I'm essential to the war effort, thanks to you.

I work hard for you.  I'll continue to work hard for you.

Like this?

You have any idea what a shirt like this costs?

How many?

What's wrong with it?

Good.  How's it going?

Thank you.

One of these days the Russians are going to show up unannounced at my gate.  I'd like the chance to defend myself.  I'd like my wife to have that chance.  My civilian engineers. My secretary.

He doesn't deserve your loyalty.  More important, he's not worth you making threats against us.

Pots and pans.

What?

I got to go, I'll see you.

You have to understand, Goeth's under enormous pressure.  You have to think of it in his situation.  He's got this whole place to run, he's responsible for everything that goes on here, all these people - he's got a lot of things to worry about.  And he's got the war. Which brings out the worst in people.  Never the good, always the bad.  Always the bad. But in normal circumstances, he wouldn't be like this.  He'd be all right.  There'd be just the good aspects of him.  Which is a wonderful crook.  A guy who loves good food, good wine, the ladies, making money...

I'll admit it's a weakness.  I don't think he enjoys it.  All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect me to do about it?

There's a rumor you've been going around miscalibrating the machines.  I don't think that's a good idea.

I know what you're saying, but I don't see the difference.

It's got nothing to do with reality, Oskar, I know it and you know it, it's a matter of national priority to these guys.  It's got a ritual significance to them, Jews shoveling snow.

He's stealing from you, Oskar.

We're going to bring her in. Hide her out for a coupla days. And we're issuing a campus lock-in this evening. No one is allowed out after dark.

Jesus Christ. Captain Tyler flies out of his seat and into action.

He's broken his pattern.

I would say we are now officially baffled.

No, some creep asshole trying to scare me.

We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.

I'm designated driver. I have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride.

WHAAAATT?

Tina, it's Dawnie. I'm  on my way. Cici follows her back into the living room.

I did that.

How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life--how do I apologize for that?

I get my revenge and make some fast cash.

But youll never get away with it.

I think he's doing Dolly.

Where's Sid?

It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper.

I don't really know what happened in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you don't trust me.

Why?

Yeah, were trying to send a message to Hollywood. Im really getting tired of all the happy endings. Its just not reality. In the real world the good guys die, the innocent are punished, and the murderers inherit the earth.

She's got guards with her.

Yeah, you look quizzical yet pensive.

So we found a compromise.

Hello, Dwight.

So what made you change your mind about Sidney?

And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.

A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?

Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am...

Let's go.

Hey, I got stuff to do. But I'll find you later, okay.

Oh--a God complex

You're getting obvious.

I'm sorry.

It's good to see you involved.

Sid, I'll come with you.

Shut up. Mickey, you and I can take her late evening.

I got a surprise for you.

Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?

We're missing the Sig Ep party.

Oh, Sid, youre sounding desparate. I guess fearing death makes one anxious.

A patio chair comes flying through a glass door. The young girl in the movie tears off running, SCREAMING, flying through the room.

How many guys they have on you?

And white.

Have they questioned you yet, Sid?

I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.

..it's really about family and tradition...

Do you want to die?

Sid? Jesus, where's Hallie? I've been here all night.

I'll be right back.

All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.

Jesus.  Hello?

Who is this?

You almost sound like that guy from THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT CARRIE. Ben. Ben Damon.

Where are you?

Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want from me?

Listen, I'm busy. Nobody has access to those files except studio execs. Can you please go away now?

Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of me.

Well I interviewed Damon once for the show. He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI.

So is that why you're here? Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?

Alright Kincaid, no where to?

Please, call me Gale.

You seem to like movies, Detective.

What do you mean?

Oh yeah, how?

Mr. Rielly? My name is Mark Kincaid. I'm with the L.A.P.D. Are you aware	of last night's Events?

Before you jump to conclusions, the man in the picture, COTTON WEARY, is out of the country on business. His alibi checks out. Seems he's got a TV show in Australia, 100% COTTON. It's supposedly the biggest thing down under since Yahoo Serious, but that's besides the point.

Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number?

Jesus Christ Sidney, what happened? I got a call on my cell from home. They told me that someone was attacked.

What?

Listen Dewey I have to go to the bathroom.

Do you really mean it this time Gale?

Why would the police come to you?

I've got my suspicions but still, nothing  you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.

Jennifer needs me.

OH. OH GOD. GALE --

Listen you sick bastard, what the fuck do you want?

Geez.

Ha. Maybe I should join SNL.

Oh, Come on!  You have made millions off the story of her murder.  You're obsessed with HER and you're obsessed with her DAUGHTER!

I think Milton's the killer. I think he just went out to kill another cast member.

Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?

Excuse me Detective, I think we have some business to attend to.

Just because you knew her?

I don't think so!  Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood?

Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.

It's not just a new script, it's a new movie.

Goddamnit I am getting so fed up with these re-writes. It's like every five minutes there's a new script. God, and you just know this all because of STAB 2's script winding up on the internet two months after it wrapped shooting.

What are you talking about? The murders were a completely isolated incident.

Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.

I didn't kill anybody.

Duh... that's quick.

Because I'm trying to build your self-esteem. You're far too sensitive.

She can't get both of us.

Did you ride past Casey Becker's house?

My dad's in the other room.

Close call.

Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good stuff was cut out and I started thinking about us and how two years ago, we started off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid "R" rating on our way to an NC17. And how things have changed and, lately, we're just sot of... edited for television.

Oh Billy... Please... God...

Jesus, SHIT!

I wanna let go. I do...

I'm gonna rip you up bitch. Just like your slut whore mother.

So why did you dial it again?

You're forgiven. Bye now.

Uh-huh.

Uh... HALLOWEEN. You know, the one with the guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around and stalks the baby sitters. What's yours?

The first one was, but the rest sucked.

So you better leave.

Don't do this. I can't...

No...

You tricked me...

Productive. So they're closing down the school?

I'm twenty-five years old, ma'am.

If you'll excuse me, ma'am.

Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.

Sheriff just radioed me. I'm gonna check out a possible lead. Thought you might like to join me.

At the airport.

Billy was released. His cellular bill was clean. He didn't make those calls.

You girls ready.

Have they found my father?

Should I be worried?

It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.

She staying with you?

Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.

Casey! Casey!

If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof.

What's the plan?

I want to talk to you.

You owe my mother.

I think you falsely identified him. Yes.

Many times.

I have no idea.

Are you alone in the house?

Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.

Can you see me right now?

Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry. Bye now.

Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.

Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?

THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT -- How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these movies?

You coming tonight?

Why would he want to kill his own girlfriend?

She's saving herself for you.

Which is you...

I thought everything was checked out.

And to celebrate this impromptu fall break, I propose we have a party. Tonight, my house.

Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.

Take a message.

Come on, Sid.

If I was wrong Cotton, then he's still out there.

Billy's right. Whenever he touches me, I just can't relax.

What do you think about when you're having sex?

How does that get you in the mood with Stu?

You know if I were accused of carving up two people, I'd take the opportunity to skip school.

With that set of lungs -- she should be.

I don't have anyone else to give this to, Somerset, you know that.  And nobody's going to swap with you.

He cuts off the skin if his fingertips. That's why we can't find a single usable print in the apartment.  He's been doing it for quite a while.  Keeps cutting before the papillary line can grow back.

You don't.  It goes to court now.

"Dear Detectives, Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light." It's the murderer's way of announcing himself.

There are seven deadly sins.  Gluttony, wrath, greed...

... envy, sloth, pride and lust.  Seven.

What time is it?

It's surprising how easily a member of the press can purchase information from the men in your precinct.

Innocent?  Is that supposed to be funny? Look at the people I killed.  An obese man, a disgusting man who could barely stand up... who if you saw him on the street, you'd point so your friends could mock him along with you.  Who if you saw him while you were eating, you wouldn't be able to finish  your meal.  After him I picked the lawyer.  And, you both must have been secretly thanking me for that one.  This was a man who dedicated his life to making money by lying with every breath he could muster... to keeping rapists and murderers on the streets.

You've made a good life for yourself...

Let me tell you how I want this to go.  I want you to look, and I want you to listen.

Not here.

The badge in my pocket says "detective," same as yours.

This doesn't make any sense.

It could be nothing.

Well?

I'd like you to meet Somerset.

Our guy got into office, probably before the building closed and security tightened up.  Gould must have been working late.

Did you read them?

Seven Terraces of Purgation.

What the fuck is that?

He just may be nuts enough.

All we do is pick up the pieces.  We take all the evidence, and all the pictures and samples.  We write everything down and note what time things happened...

Why would we?

Never in my twenty-four years, knock on wood.  I've only ever taken my gun out five times with the actual intention of using it.  Never fired it though.  Not once.  You?

How did the fire fight end?

It is Victor.

I'm sick of sitting around, waiting for him to kill again.

Sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.

We don't know for sure...

This quote... his first words to us.  I looked it up.  It's from Milton's Paradise Lost.  "Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light... "

Yeah.  Some college student who's taking English 101 and just happens to be writing a paper on Twentieth Century Crime.

The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqu... Aquin...

Are you alright?

What are you talking about?

You know... there's not going to be a happy ending to this.  It's not possible anymore.

No.  Face it now.  Stop thinking it's good guys against bad guys.

Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind.  There's no winning and losing here.

What the fuck is wrong with you?  What burnt you out?

Oh, you're so much better than everyone, right?  No one's worthy of you.

Tell me it's not true.

It's nice to meet you.  My husband has told me a lot about you... except your first name.

I hear you and Mills were high school sweethearts.

Well, I got up one morning and went to work... just like any other day, except it was my first since hearing about the baby. And, I... I felt this fear and anxiety washing over me.  I looked around, and I thought, how can we raise a child surrounded by all this?  How can a child grow up here?  So, that night, I told her I didn't want us to have it, and over the next few weeks, I convinced her it was wrong.  I mean... I wore her down, slowly.

Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.

How's California?

Killed every one -- an' not for food either...Why'd they do a thing like that?

What you saw wasn't Lucy.

As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage...

Another one, eh?

You all right, sergeant?

Ethan, you an' Martin are hereby appointed civilian scouts -- without pay...Charlie, hightail it to head- quarters an' spread the word...

He cometh forth like a...

If you were tryin' to surround 'em, you sure succeeded.

Now son, it's a bitter thing to say, but there's more than your sister at stake here.

I didn't <U>want</U> to tell you...but maybe it's your right to know.

I say NO!

Go on! Whyn't you have your bugler sound the charge while you're at it??

If there's anything I can do, sir...

But he knows THAT, sir...Can't I stay, sir?

Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.

My pa wants to know...<U>Colonel</U> <U>Greenhill</U> wants to know how soon you could put a company of your Rangers in the field, fully armed and equipped, for joint punitive action against the Comanches.

You tell your pa a company of Rangers -- all fourteen of 'em -- fully armed an' equipped will be in the field by daylight...headin' for the south end of the Malapai. If he can catch up with us, well an' good...

How'd you come by this?

Scar? Never heard of any Chief Scar.

And maybe you lie...

Somethin' mighty fishy about this trail, Uncle Ethan...

Good night...Laurie...

He's agreed to take you on and share the increase from my herd while I'm gone...I'll be pushin' on tomorrow...

Hey! What's the idea...?

Futterman?

<U>YOU</U> don't understand, ya chunkhead! <U>You</U> didn't buy any blanket! Ya bought <U>her</U>!

Beats me how she could get that pony out o' camp without neither of us hearin' a thing...

Least, <U>THEY</U> won't feed any Comanches this winter...Killin' buffalo's as good as killin' Injuns in this country.

Lemme alone...

They'll be back...

I know you are...Only it ain't goin' to be that way...she's alive...

Was your niece about their age?

Comancheros...

Why it's just a snip of calico...

Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?

Oh, all right! Well...Martin says...

Don't go takin' that stuff...

Futterman!...He's got a little tradin' post on the South Fork o' the Brazos...Laurie, I just got to get me a good horse! Think yer pa would...

Don't cry, Laurie...I understand how it is...I'll just go 'way...

Where?

But couldn't you...?

Why else?

So, how does it feel to be kissed by two women?

Cherry-red Tears, your first book. I read it at least nine times.  And then I found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair.

I miss Tommi so much.

Who was that?

Martin, it's not funny!

Where have you been all day?

"Events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals..."

Martin, what-

Of course you'll give me the blame again.  Like back then.  Just a tiny cut and he could still be alive today - isn't that right, Ellen?

How did you get me out of there?

Ellen.

Stop scaring people.  Let's go. We need to be on our way.

You didn't tell her!

Hammer?

Hey, my man!  How's the masterpiece coming along?

We are in desperate want of a Mercutio, Ned, a young nobleman of Verona

What is money to me like us? Besides, if I need a play, I have another waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.

And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you?

How much?

Most interesting.

I have not said all. By malign fate, the message goes astray which would tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He hears only that Juliet is dead. And thus he goes to the Apothecary.

But I have to pay the actors and the authors.

Is it going well?

No Juliet?!

God be praised!  Locked?

Well, I to my work, you to yours. When can I see pages?

Cut round him for now.

I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. The BARMAN does the business.

The daughter of his enemy.

Good luck with yours, Kit.

This is a different one.

Two hours at prayer!

God bless you!

Well-monied is the same as well-born and well-married is more so. Lord Wessex was looking at you tonight.

Your mother, and your father

I have seen you. You are the one who comes to all the plays--at Whitehall, at Richmond.

As stories must when love's denied--with tears and a journey. Those whom God has joined in marriage, not even I can put asunder.

When will you write me a sonnet, Will?

You left it in my bed. Come to look for it again.

Master Shakespeare

Better fortune, boy.

Wait, you'll see the cat bites his head off.

My lady!

Alas indeed, for I thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart.

You can bring them with a word.

Can you love a fool?

And that was only my first try.

You cannot! Not for the Queen herself!

He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.

Nono.

Will you read it for me?

An excellent beginning  Let him bea duke. And your heroine?

My lady Viola.

She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.

Good morning, my lord!

I am very sorry, sir, I have not seen Act Two.

She tells me to keep away. She is to marry Lord Wessex. What should I do?

And break her heart and mine?

And her lips?

She sings too?

What of her bosom?

In the same fashion as chess.

I'm only asking what you think.

Only on expenses.

No.

You mean immoral.

Now what else? DAVID I don't know.

You know what. Who's going to do it.

Listen, it's important. We need to talk about what we're going to do --

Good luck. I love that guy, but why does he have to follow us around?

How much?

Doesn't it worry you?

Nothing.

I want to secure it.

You looking for me?

Who?

They know.

You old devil. Well, anyway, as you can see, we're leaving.

I've never seen any of these men before.

Sorry to waste your time.

Just one thing.

When you get up in the morning, how do you decide what shade of black to wear?

I thought you stopped going.

You see, they don't really know me.

Maybe he didn't like us.

What sort of car?

Hugo. Hugo. Sorry about this, but can you open the door? It's us, Hugo, your flatmates and companions. Your new-found friends. He's not in. He's left and we'll probably never see him again.

Now?

No.

Sshh.

What's he doing here?

Well, you certainly had a good look around.

No.

Once it's spent you won't have to worry about it.

Boy, am I glad to see you.

He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him, you'd use your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe.

We could put it somewhere.

I refuse.

And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything?

Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.

I don't know. I thought maybe I was --

It's about me and David.

Don't you ever stop?

So, uh...

Downstairs.

Of course.

How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading information. Only three people here. You're sure?

No, I've never seen them.

It's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction, afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is, quite simply, just that.

Just get on with it, Alex.

Two hundred.

Expecting anyone?

Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?

Who have you talked to?

I'm sorry.

So let's go.

Yes.

What?

What do we do here, David?

You get the job done.

It's nice.

I see.

I write about it?

It's up to you. Air Patagonia. New outfit: via Caracas and Bogot . No catering. Four hundred and eleven pounds. Four one one. Good value, but refueling at Bogot  is variable.

Both, sir.

Your watch.

I thought you were in a good mood.

Then what's the problem?

Maybe he's just a kooky guy who likes doing something kooky like that.

I'm thinking of investing with him. He worries me.

You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?

Lester.

We cannot go into this later.

-- is that right?

I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.

Thanks a lot.

Why not?

I'll be back in a while.

Nummers.

What're you doing later?

She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?

Comb my hair out later, honey.

Sweetheart, it's a bore out there... let's lock the door.

That headboard.

Like what?

Shit.

She's out, but you're supposed to wait.

Are you gay?... baked apple?... they're cold but they're good.

Well, are you?

What?

Yeah.

Right now?

I went to school with her husband.

And you need money?

You do know what money's like these days.

I've got the customers... that's my point. I'm the one they want. If I had my own shop, they'd leave and come to me. I have a lot of customers.

You do it.

Jesus...

-- Well no. It never came up.

Where do you want to do this?

Well, what do you think?

Jill's coming with us.

She's incredible...  She loves you, George.

What's wrong?

Bernstein... seemed to think I hated men.

And?

George... how about Felicia?

Did you?

Now, baby... if I told you about her... then you couldn't count on me not telling anymore... could you?

Baby...

It'll ruin everything.

Sit down.

Look, either come in or stay out!

-- you'll be the prettiest thing in the room -- light's green...

-- what guy?

He just completely ignores me. He could have at least said something, introduced me or something.

-- don't you want to --

What are you looking at?

-- yeah.

-- what?

-- ass and legs --

What's wrong?

-- we're kidding ourselves.

-- last night I dreamt I was fifty years old and Mary told me I was supposed to meet Jill at the shop. It seared me shitless.

Well then what are you trying to do-

So I'm saying it...

God, there's Lester...

-- Right after I sprayed her?

Hey, what's happening?  Mary! Telephone.  What's the matter?

Oh yeah?

Yeah?...

I'm busy, man.

Yeah!

-- You takin' a lot of shit lately, George.

-- you shouldn't talk to me like that no matter what, George... you know better...

-- you shouldn't do me like that...

Nothing, my sister's back from Vegas.

I have to see you.

Call me!

There were some shots.

Now, George --

Honey?

George.

I already said hello.

They didn't offer you the job yet.

When is that, George?

What?

I've been trying to reach you all afternoon. You weren't in the shop. What is this thing tonight?

I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't you think you could call me and let me know? Look at my hair.

Television or movies?

-- well aren't you --

I don't want to fight, George.

Well that's something.

Yes.

Baby, please don't... I love you.

Stop it.

Felicia says you're a very good hairdresser.

Oh, well, I went to beauty school... you know you go to beauty school... and you get your operator's license... and you graduate... and you're a hairdresser.

But the important thing is you're successful at it.

Well, George, you may not think ten or fifteen grand means much to me, but I invest for myself and a lot of particular people.

I know it, I know it.

I wanna know your thinking, I wanna know how someone like you thinks. Did you think you could get away with it, did you think you could put something over on me? Does a guy like you get his kicks sneaking around behind people's backs and taking advantage of them? Maybe that's your idea of being anti Establishment!

That's got nothing to do with it... You're so beyond my comprehension I can't even discuss it with you.

I wanna hear it from you!

... yes, I follow your thinking on that.

Do you think Lorna hates her? I don't think she hates her. I mean she may resent her a little...

Yeah,, it goes up a little and then it goes down, maybe Nixon will do something. What's the difference, they're all a bunch of jerks. I wouldn't let 'em run my business, I can tell you that much. Not if I had any choice in the matter.  I don't know what to do with you. I don't know, I don't know what's right or wrong anymore.

I mean, how did that happen?

All right, who're you with? Jill?



You're home.

I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now...  I'm not kidding.

Well, commercials. I read for a soap the other day.

I called to tell you I was sending one over but the line was busy, you're always on the phone.

Steve Slutes, and he's not a boy.  Steve couldn't get arrested as an actor. He couldn't get arrested as a boy.

It's very logical, it's the most logical thing in the world. You wouldn't feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner, and a little conversation and so forth...

Shut the door, shut the door!

I'd like a drink.

Here.

No.

Who are they?

Hi, Leonard.

That's right.

Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.

You're really a love -- you sure?

-- Yeah, honey...

How much?

-- He reached up and tore them.

Go ahead, Jill, you can say it.

... my friend doesn't like it here either.

Well he's not exactly a friend.

Sort of.

-- oh, sure. A hairdresser. How... how do you a... meet a hairdresser?

This other couple that we're here with, do you know them very well?

Well -- as I see it we've got two choices. We can hang around here and wait for the bomb to go off, or we can go to my party.

-- why?

Do you have children?

Dad?

Yes.

Yes I do.  I love it.  Don't you?

Dad?

Yes.

Yes.

Maybe he showed me something.

Yeah.

We'll get something as soon as we get to the hotel, okay?

The loser has to keep American clean, how's that?

Give me your hand.  Oh, isn't it beautiful.

It's so pretty.

Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?

I won't make any noise.

Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?

Is Tony one of your animals?

Tony.

It's okay, really.

No.

Who?

No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady. I'll deal with that situation as soon as I get out of here.

Just give me one more chance to prove it, Mr. Grady.  That's all I ask.

I fear that you will have to deal with this matter in the harshest possible way, Mr. Torrance.  I fear that is the only thing to do.

I'd be glad to do that, sir.  Oh why don't you call me back in about eh twenty minutes?

Oh Dick, come on over and say hello to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.

Mrs. Torrance, your husband introduced you as Winifred.  Now are you a Winnie or a Freddie?

Don't let it get you down Mrs. Torrance - it's big but it still ain't nothing but a kitchen... a lot of the stuff you'll never have to touch.

Bill, how do you do?

Eh - formerly a school-teacher.

Best goddamned bartender from Timbuctoo to Portland Maine - Portland Oregon for that matter.

Good Morning, hon.  Your breakfast is ready.

He's still asleep.

Jack!

Yes...

As soon as possible.

Of course I am.

I just want to go back to my room.

Stay away from me!

Stop it!

Stay... stay away!

Give me the bat.

I'm Jack Torrance.

Have any trouble finding us?

Only in a very general way.

Well, obviously some people can be

Good morning Jack.  I hope you haven't been waiting too long.

I'd better collect my family first.

Yes, very cosy for a family, and if you feel like spreading out you have the rest of the hotel to move around in.

even before anybody knew what a jet set was.  We've had four presidents who stayed here, lots of movie stars.

By five o'clock tonight, you'll never know anybody was ever here.

Jack is going to take care of the Overlook for this winter.  I would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through.

Holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-Jesus-CHRIST!

Yes. Go away.

Marty? You okay? You've just been sitting here all morning.

Not bad, huh? My Uncle Al took off the regular muffler and put on a Cherry Bomb.

There's something else scary.

Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager! Stone the crows!

Mom-!

Huh?

Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.

Your mom's not around, is she?

Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like that... but I got something that just might cheer you up.

Stay near the house, for Christ's sake- someone's killing people. I have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know.

It came for me! I shot it in the eye! Now he's wearing an eye-patch!

Well... was it a prescription?

I saw what I saw.

I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.

But how?

LET THY SPIRIT

He's... dreamy.  He's...

So, hi there.  I'm... Sister Mary Clarence.  And you're... young Christians.  I guess I should assign you this passage.  What's good?  What were you talking about?

No, but... I don't know... sometimes.

Okay, Christy -- strip.

How did I get so lucky?  What is it now, five years we've been together?  Who do I thank?

Sure.

Babe, what happened here?  Look at you.

This prom is a real drag.

He's so dreamy.  He's like... a Greek god.  He's the cutest guy here.    He's boss.  He's fab.  He's...

Isn't it a glorious morning?  Good morning, Mary Clarence.  sleep well?

The minute I saw you. I said to myself, she's a weaver.  Have you ever used a loom?

Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy.  I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.

Is this... choir practice?

You see?  We've got the voices.  They're just allover the place. I've heard all of you, in the shower --you're decent. Better than me.  We just need charts -- harmony -- chops.

Mary Patrick -- do you remember the Dixie Cups?

Jackpot!  Two buckets

MY SOUL WAS IN DANGER I'D FALLEN FROM GRACE

Shirelles.

Of course.  I'm a nun.  Four Popes now. The Lord hates a loafer.

Babies

Hey -- you re supposed to be the cheerful one.  Why do I suddenly feel like Snow White?

What?

You have to help me

No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out!  I want to get in?

Well, then there's only one thing to do.

We must... get you some experience.  We must... leave this place.

We need experience.

Mary Clarence!

It's contraband.  Don't ask.  But I wanted to give you a treat.  A sort of... thank-you gift.

Sit down.

And all those like you.

Cool.  Is there a menu?  Or buffet?

The Mary is in deference to the Holy Mother, the Clarence in honor of Saint Clarence Loyola.  There are three vows that every nun must accept.  The vow of poverty...

And the vow of chastity.

Surely you are familiar with this practice, Mary Clarence.  Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard.

Right, sure thing.  But what about, like, appliances?  Like a little color portable?  Boom box?

A balloon and a banana!  Tell me, Mary Clarence, what were you thinking?

Sometimes it's not enough!

So... hi there.

Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your behavior was inexcusable!

Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct.

Hold on.  That's not fair.  I worked hard with them.  They gave up their free time, and they loved it.  Those women are happy.  And we can get even better.  We can wake this place up.

And on such an occasion, I feel a completely traditional program will be best.

But -- why?

You and I know that life is not so simple.  There will be disappointments. Rude shocks.  And you will have vanished. How... fortunate.

I am sorry, Mary Clarence.  I seem to have misplaced my tambourine.  Good day, Mary Clarence.

Really?  And maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?

I hate you.  I totally hate you.

So what am I supposed to do in the meantime?

I really can't talk about it now.  The place is packed.  SRO.  I've got a show to do.

I am?

Well..  thanks.  I've been thinking about you.. - sometimes.  I mean, there aren't a lot of guys around here.  I mean, sometimes I feel like... a nun.

Eddie -- I've got to go back.  They won't sing without me.  I'm deserting them.

What're you doing?

Vince -- is she... okay?

Right.

Get her!

So that guy in the bar was right?  She's like... some kind of nun?

What's she doing?

We sound terrible   We need Mary Clarence.

Yes, Mary Patrick?

Sister Mary Patrick?

She told us about one.  The Little Sisters of the Moonlight.  In Las Vegas.

But, Reverend Mother -- everyone loves our new style.

Mary Clarence!  Sister!

Reverend Mother?

But she's been exposed to the underside of life.  She is the underside of life.

But, Bishop, surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood.

I mean, won't she talk? She seemed kind of upset.

And who are you to talk?  You were nothing.  You couldn't even sing.  I must have been out of my mind.

Um... I... I did not... no.  Why?

What the hell are you doing?

Why did you move the body, Doctor?

Stains of blood.

Wallowing quite literally in blood.

Do you have these persons' wills?

Very few, if any.

Tell me something.  What becomes of Young Masbath?

The Van Garretts died first; a man and his son, survived by a wife and two infants.  And the Widow Windsor was next...

Listen to what you say....

I manage fine alone.

No, I couldn't...

Thank you.

What is it?

We are leaving.

If the Crone's wound bled hard, that means she was not killed by the Hessian.  Someone only tried to make it look that way.

Well... I'm one of the few people who likes you.

Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And why?

Must be some sort of gateway.  But, why this place... ?

If someone has the Horseman's skull... if they control the Horseman, then why haven't they sent him for your head yet?

What was she doing?

What can we do?

How are you?

Not all think it is the Horseman. Many say witches come from the Western Woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons.  Some believe a person in this very town kneels before Lucifer, offering death as tribute.  And, still others believe none of it.

You pay great attention to small things.  I hide these as I hide all my books.  Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible.

He only appears to be inside the cage.  The point being...

I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.

Must I hear this?

Lady Van Tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she?  She bears so little resemblance.

Memories have come back.  I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now.  Lord, how I hate this place.

What... what are you doing... ?

When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could not believe it.  I had to hide these... at least till I could confront him myself.

He did not do these things.  If you knew him, you would realize...

Katrina...

Where are we going?

The church.

Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina is not in her room.

Here... in front of this oak, facing north.  Horrible...

There was not much blood, was there?

Van Ripper, turn the coach about!

Lay still, Ichabod.  Do not move.

Scooter, did I tell about the two old boys pissin' off the bridge?

All right then.

Hit ain't got no gas in it.

Thank ye.

Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did.  Do you know Scooter, Jerry?

That old man of his still livin' over there on Clark Street I believe.

Karl, come over here. I want you to meet your new boss.  This is Bill Cox, runs this place. Says you can work here and stay in the back.

How 'bout you, Jerry.

Doin' pretty good. Got a sick tiller here. What's got you down this way?

Well, I guess it's all good.

French fries. I like to eat them pretty good.

Sixty for small and seventy-five for large.

Okay ladies and gentlemen  or both. It's come to the time in our show when we like to introduce the band. Over here on lead guitar Mr. Randy Horsefeathers. Come on hit a hot lick, Randy.  Well, come on, y'all are supposed to clap now. Come on! 

We'll go to church and get you baptized, tomorrow's Sunday. You go on back to bed.

How'd your baptizin' go?

Well, honey, I don't guess I give a shit. I ain't here half the time anyway. If you want a retard livin' in the garage, I don't guess I care. I've got a good tool box and socket set out there I don't want stol'd. I guess I could take it home with me.

Now son, I wadn't talkin' to you, was I?  Was I?

I'd better go on home now, it's late. I have to work tomorrow.

Doyle, don't you lay one hand on her.

I'm a witness. I heard you threaten her life.

I wanted for you to meet Karl, too. He's my new friend. But I feel like I've always known him. I thought you should meet him.

They let you out?

How do you know?

How did your mama die?

Karl.  You know when I said daddy got hit by a train.

Where'd you get them flowers?

It's name's A Christmas Carol.

I know you could of scored them three touchdowns by yourself instead of throwing 'em over to me.

Hey, Karl. How'd you know to come out here?

Will ye do somethin' for me if I ast you to?

Hey Karl, guess what. Mama said you can stay with us. Out in the garage. Our car won't fit in there anyway. It's real neat.

Karl, now listen, there's gonna be a party tonight here at the house. Doyle's invited his music-playin' buddies over to make a bunch of racket out on the patio.

You all right, Mama?

I guess. He went to the garage. Poor thing, he's probably never seen such a crazy mess. He probably wants to go back and live in Mr. Cox's shop.

I know honey. Just remember what I said, we'll bide our time. You just steer clear of him as much as you can. Doyle's had a real hard life. It's just about run him crazy I think.

These is the worst shoes I own for walkin'. How far did you want to go?

I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.

Karl, what in the world are you doing here?

Your daddy's still livin' down there from what you told me.  I guess he wouldn't help you any, would he? I wasn't thinking. You don't know anybody?

Yeah.

You scared me.

Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?

Do you reckon you can make me some biscuits?

Yes ma'am.

I wouldn't mind a havin' supper.

You're a hell of a boy, Frank. Someday you're gonna get all the good things you deserve. And Karl here's gonna get some more biscuits tonight. What do you think about that?

All right then. Well, I'll see you later. If you see Frank, tell him to come on back home. I don't get to see him all day except Sundays. He can play tomorrow.

What brings you back?

Yes sir.

Naw, I ain't.

Quite a spell, I reckon.

Well that's a very offensive way to put it. You shouldn't say that. You were taught that, weren't you?

Y'all have a seat. Is this all of you?

Can't you talk to him? Maybe talk him into it. I'm a real good interviewer. Just get me in the room with him.

His mother told him that he was their punishment. Hers and his father's; from God, for having sex--

Is he leaving right this minute?

Also, Melinda, please don't tell anybody at the store that Albert was here tonight, okay.

No! At least I don't think I am!

And your father? Is he from New York?

What'll it be, Auggie?

Two tins of Schimmelpennincks. And throw in a lighter while you're at it.

Are you closed?

How'd you get started?

I've never seen anything like it.

What do you mean?

But they're all the same.

The kid's sorry, Auggie.

Anything good?

It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be good.

Did you ever go back to see her?

You made her happy. And the camera was stolen anyway. It's not as if the person you took it from really owned it.

I wouldn't say that. But at least you've put the camera to good use.

Is that all? I thought it was about three hundred.

Talk away, lady of my dreams. I'm all ears.

Our daughter? Is that what you said? Our daughter? I mean, you might have a daughter, but I sure as hell don't. And even if I did -- which I don't -- she wouldn't be our daughter.

I know what it means. That still don't make it a good name.

You've suckered me before, darling, remember? Why should I believe you now?

A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.

You're conning me, sweetheart. I ain't responsible for no baby.

Fifteen years ago?  It won't wash, pumpkin. No mother waits fifteen years to tell a man he's a father. I wasn't born yesterday, you know.

It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.

Still, you can't just write her off.

For keeps?

There's just one thing I want to know.

Lovely.

I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.

A job?  I definitely wouldn't turn down a job.

I'll be back in about an hour. Watch the register while I'm gone, okay?

It's for you.

So I can get my job back.

To look at the dirty magazines. I can see all the naked women I want, and it doesn't cost me a cent.

That's how it is with sidewalks. People come, people go, and they all drop shit on the ground. As soon as you clean up one spot and move on to the next, the first spot is dirty again.

Does it hurt?

Forty-four. They're on special this week from the Canary Islands. A real bargain.

A good choice. You wouldn't want to celebrate the birth of your firstborn with a box of stinkers, would you? Remember to keep them in the refrigerator until you hand them out.

It'll keep them fresh. If they get too dry, they'll break. And you don't want that to happen, do you?  Tobacco is a plant, and it needs the same loving care you'd give an orchid.

Any time. And congratulations to you and your wife. Just remember, though, in the immortal words of Rudyard Kipling: "A woman is just a woman, but a cigar is a smoke.

And what was he doing here in the first place? That's what I want to know. What's a man like you messing around with a black boy like Thomas for? Are you some kind of pervert, or what?

I just want to know where he is.

I always knew that boy had an imagination, but now he's gone and made up a whole new life for himself.  Do you mind if I sit down?  He's been living with me and his uncle Henry since he was a baby. And we don't live in Manhattan. We live in Boerum Hill. In the projects.

Jesus had nothing to do with it. If He'd been involved. He would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did.

No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead.

You going to sit here all day?

Let me give you some useful information, son. There's two dollars and fifty-seven cents in that cash register over there  and considering all the time you've put in casing the joint so far, you won't make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains. However you slice it, that's a losing proposition.

It's rundown, all right. But drawing a picture won't improve the way it looks.  Let's see what you did, Rembrandt.

Thomas Cole. My name is Thomas Jefferson Cole.

Yeah? Who is it?

You still have that watch Auggie gave you?

It's okay, mister. No big deal.

Are you sure you don't want some food to go along with it? It might help to absorb some of that liquid. You don't want to slosh around too much when you stand up.

You must eat lunch pretty early. It's only eleven o'clock.

Look, kid, it's okay with me. You don't have to play games. If you want a hamburger or something, go ahead and order it.

You don't know me from a hole in the wall.

I can take care of myself. Don't worry.

I used to have one, but it broke a couple of years ago and I never got around to replacing it.  I'd just as soon not have one anyway. I hate those damn things.

I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way.  The world is in your head, remember?

Is that what you do? Draw pictures?

I didn't ask to come here. You invited me, remember?  If you want me to leave, all you have to do is say so.

Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man. 

Close the door.  Sit down in that chair.  Now listen carefully. Your Aunt Em came here a couple of days ago. She was sick with worry, out of her mind. We had an interesting talk about you, Thomas. Do you understand what I'm saying? Your aunt thinks you're in trouble and so do I. Tell me about it, kid. I want to hear all about it right now.

You're joking, right? I mean, that's your way of trying to be funny, right?

Thanks. 

Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go.  Besides, I'm making up for lost time.

Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?

Here we are.  Rembrandt's drawings. Edward Hopper. Van Gogh's letters.

It's 1942, right? And he's caught in Leningrad during the siege. I'm talking about one of the worst moments in human history. Five hundred thousand people died in that one place, and there's Bakhtin, holed up in an apartment, expecting to be killed any day. He has plenty of tobacco, but no paper to roll it in. So he takes the pages of a manuscript he's been working on for ten years and tears them up to roll his cigarettes.

So you're saying it wasn't like that at all.

Good thinking.

Yeah, well, you have to be nuts to do what you did. If you want my opinion, you should give this money back to the Creeper. Just give it back and tell him you're sorry.

Well?

Fuck you, too, you white son-of-a-bitch.

We came here to deliver some clean laundry.

Yeah, give him another one. And I'll take a cup of coffee while you're at it.

Do you have real iced coffee, or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes?

Lettuce and tomato?

I am a bastard.  I'm a big Hun Nazi son of a bitch.  And I still got your bamboo fishing rod.

$1200 an acre, that's what I paid Ole, won't take a dime less.  You got no choice on that.

Him and his folks and two brothers and two sisters worked our land. Lived in a picker's cabin at first.

When your son came back from the war, what did he say about all this?

Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.

Happy for him.  And relieved.

Yes, and then, what was there to call about?  Everything was up in the air.

We discussed that.  And decided not to.

Trials aren't only about truth, Mr. Hooks.  Even though they should be.  They're about what people <u>believe</u> is true.

It was my specialty, sir, I trained several thousand over the years.

So if defendant had tied up to deceased's boat.  With that last one.  Would those cleats have lined up?

Greedy.

I asked you a question, you're writing a tract, h...

Sheriff said right off, I was under suspicion.  I didn't have a lawyer...

My apologies.  Do you regret not telling the truth?

Well, the sheriff found <u>two</u> batteries in your well.  If you left one with Carl Heine, how is that possible?

How long you have this detail?

It's on the twine, too.  But it's not r...

It's the way it happened, I know it is.

Your daddy.  Was quite a feller.

Then where's the lantern?  And where's the knife?

If I whistle.  Those boys'll see you, and come runnin'.  <u>You're</u> the story today.

And what's that?

You want me to say that.

You think that <u>is</u> the truth.

Is it possible his head struck the transom, or the stern gunnel, or the net roller, as you were bringing him in?

You don't.  <u>Think</u> so.

How <u>is</u> your mother-in-law?

And her farmhouse...?

What else could it be?

That's <u>why</u> the autopsy report identifies <u>drowning</u> as the cause of death.

Well, he didn't say 'no', did he? Didn't say no hope existed.

The sweep is just routine, not even police action.  I'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence...

Are these your bags?

Yes, Sue?  What is it?

I beg your pardon.

This a private clambake, or can anybody join?

Okay. 

I mean, we get paid tonight, don't we?

But we'll freeze - it's below zero - we'll catch pneumonia.

Greased Lightning!  Why do I listen to you? I ought to have my head examined!

No.  And he ain't been eating so good, either. He's got an empty stomach and it's gone to his head.

It's a hundred miles, Joe - it's snowing - how are we going to get there?

We could've had three weeks in Florida - all expenses paid.  Lying around in the sun - palm trees - frying fish...

You going to call the police?

And it's so drafty.  They must be catching colds all the time.

I feel so naked.  Like everybody's looking at me.

Not there - that's the emergency brake.

Forget it.  One false move, and they'll toss us off the train - there'll be the police, and the papers, and the mob in Chicago...

What are you doing?

But suppose I got to go - like for a drink of water?

Male and female - the moth and the flame - I ought to slug you!

What are you talking about?  Sugar and me, we're just like sisters.

With ME?

Tell him you get seasick on a yacht. Play miniature golf with him.

What are you doing with my flowers?

Hi, Jerry.  Everything under control?

Jerry, listen to me - there are laws - conventions - it's just not being done!

Look, Jerry - take my advice - forget the whole thing - just keep telling yourself you're a boy!

It's just going to break his heart when he finds out I can't marry him.

What are you giving me with the omelette?

Since when?  Usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.

Did you hear that?

Elope?  But there are laws - conventions -

I'm a very sick girl.

Who needs vermouth?

And bring the cocktail shaker.

I'll carry the instruments.

Oh, I have some suntan lotion.

I recognized him too - his picture was in Vanity Fair.

No!

No!

I always did.

Didn't you girls say you went to a conservatory?

Yes, I'm holding on.

Yes, indeed.  It's cost my family quite a bit of money.

If I promise not to be a naughty boy - how about dinner tonight?

Oh, of course.  which of these instruments do you play?

Fascinating.  Do you use a bow or do you just pluck it?

You must be quite a girl.

Please.  It won't happen again.

You're leading again.

Another bridesmaid?

I called Mama - she was so happy she cried - she wants you to have her wedding gown - it's white lace.

The New Caledonia.  That's the name of it.  The Old Caledonia went down during a wild party off Cape Hatteras.  But tell her not to worry - this is going to be a quiet little midnight snack - just the two of us.

What's the job?

Because I got some plans -

Hey, Sheboygan - you two - what was your last job - playing square dances?

Really?

That so?

You don't say?

You know I'm going to be twenty-five in June?

About the future.  You know - like a husband?  That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.

Want to switch berths with me?

I wish you'd make sure.

Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.

Your face is familiar.

Yeah.  Real hot.

So do I.  as a matter of fact, I spent three years at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.

You're very kind.  I'll bet you're also very gentle - and helpless -

Why?

And you will come to hear us tonight?

Well, he's young and handsome and a bachelor - and he's a real gentleman - not one of these grabbers.

It's exquisite - like a floating mansion.

Down the hatch - as we say at sea.

Where's your shell collection?

Well, it was my freshman year at Princeton - there was this girl - her name was Nellie - her father was vice-president of Hupmobile - she wore glasses, too.  That summer we spent our vacation at the Grand Canyon - we were standing on the highest ledge, watching the sunset - suddenly we had an impulse to kiss - I took off my glasses - I took a step toward her - she took a step toward me -

My family did everything they could - hired the most beautiful French upstairs maids - got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in Boston - imported a whole troupe of Balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails - what a waste of money!

Is that anything?

Don't talk like that.  I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -

I never knew it could be like this.

Good night.

That's wonderful.  Poor Josephine.

Oh - that kind of a merger.  Is she young? Pretty?

Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee, sour-mash coffee...

A little country club we run for retired bootleggers.  I'm gonna put your name up for membership.

I heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing.

Say, Maestro - where were you at three o'clock on St. Valentine's Day?

Because the day after the shooting you sent in a pair of spats - they had blood on them.

Me and those two witnesses whom your lawyers have been looking for all over Chicago.

Refresh my memory.

That's very refreshing. Now what's the password?

Thanks, Charlie.

Hi, Spats.  We was laying eight to one you wouldn't show.

I don't know what you're talking about.

We were eating and puking together in harmony until one day, Tony walked me home from school. He was my first boyfriend.  I was fourteen.

Wow. You look beautiful.

Fred Astaire and whats her face!

She blames Tony Pee-Pants Pinterello for everything. The fall of the British Empire, the Cold War, the internet.

Just because some slags been paid for, doesnt mean youve got to...you know.

Hey, you!

Is this supposed to be an apology?

You know, they say you can tell everything you need to know about a person from the way they act when theyre naked.

Jeffrey knows love like he knows macramé.

What does your gut say?

How does it feel to get that much money just for being you?

How did you know that was me?

You shit!

I love that youre asking questions, but do you really want to get into all of this?

Subtle?

Come on.

Are you sure?

So youre telling me. If something had happened last night...it would have cost me fourteen hundred dollars? Thats a down payment on a Ford Focus!

What?

When I said Id never done a wedding before, I didnt say that no one ever asked. I just never said yes.

There was something in your voice on the phone that day.

Yeah. You?

Besides, you hired me for my discretion.

Nice speech. I thought it was touching... and funny.

Kat Ellis! We live two hundred miles away from each other but I have to fly all the way to London to see you. You havent visited me once in D.C. Where the hell have you been? I have gynecologists that call more often.

Like fifteen.

Oh, no. He told you.

Yeah.

What do you say to that?

Best thing about being a dad is when your kid starts kicking your ass--

I just wanta wash my hand. It's got blood where I hurt it.

No, mam... I come from way back there. Me and my dog was tryin' to find my daddy and we got lost.

That does it...

Dr. William E. B. Dubois. 

He was real scared nobody would believe him -- I could tell, even when he first stood up.

I been like that myself, when I thought nobody was gonna believe me...  You wanna hear another story?!

:...HEARTS. AND TO THEMSELVES IN THESE DAYS THAT TRY THEIR SOULS...

:...THE CHANCE TO SOAR IN THE DIM BLUE AIR ABOVE SMOKE IS TO THEIR...

I can't do it, Rita -- that's the policy here on colored prisoners, and I ain't about to change it, not even for a friend like you.

Daddy, you home now... that's all I want -- I don't want nothin' else...

Where's everybody?

I'm real proud of how you helped your mama to keep this place goin', David Lee.

From Miss Johnson --

Dear David, if you are coming to school here, be sure to bring some warm clothes. The school term will begin September 8th, but it would be good for you to be here by the 4th or 5th of the month. I do hope everything is fine and you will be here. Give my "hello" to your family. Yours truly, Miss Camille Johnson...

Mister, can you visit anybody here?

Miss Boatwright --

Ready to go, Mama!

You got two shirts on?

Don't take my Daddy! Please don't take my Daddy!

So did I. I figured when the time got right, we could all take a day or two and walk up there, but it's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone.

What's wrong, Nathan?

I'll find out where your daddy is for you.

You know, one time by mistake I went into a white church down in Row County and to this day I don't know how'n the devil I got outta that church alive.

Mama, what was we laughin' for?

Rebecca, you jest the one I wanta see.

Whatcha wanta order?

You ready to eat?

If there ever was a devil in this county, Ike, you is it!

This done happen before. It ain't nothin' -- I just have to wait a minute or two.

I just got out here!

Howya do, Rebecca. I sorta been expectin' you this mornin'.

What?

Notice that nothing happens.  Now say 'Montana.'

Why the fuck not?

Dude!

What is this?

<b>And my mom has become so bu-sy that she's raising heck and ignoring me I agree that there is now a battle to be won! Something must be done!</b>

Is it Cartman's mom?

Dude, this is seriously lame. I didn't know we were gonna get all dirty and stuff.

How come Terrance and Phillip are so weird looking?

Dude, how can you hate the environment?

I can't dude! We all took a sacred oath, and swore ourselves to secrecy!

You know, me and Stan were just talking about what a fat fucking hunk o' fat fuck you are.

Bingo. Okay, here we go...  Want to help Terrance and Phillip? Meet us for a meeting at Gladdy's barn tomorrow night...

Cartman?!

Look, Eric it's your little friends.

Eric!  Don't talk to Ms. Brovlofski that way!

Mom...

Eric?! Eric, what is it?!

You've got a stupid accent too.

Thank God, that sucked ass.

The N word?

Yes I am!

What? What do you mean you don't belong here? Relax guy, hell is for children.

What's that?

YOU GOTTA BE FUCKING KIDDING ME!!

Who is it?

Do you see them?  Do you see Terrance and Phillip?

It's so very cold...

That was sweet!

Nowhere.

Oh my God! THEY killed Kenny!

How can they do this?

Dude, let's help Terrance and Phillip!!

It's only a matter of time before my mom has HIM burned too!

I don't know. But it has gone far enough! I'm sick of it!  <b>Something must be done! Change has got to come around! They're taking all our laughter and burning it to the ground! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of chains and ties and glue! We have to fight before they've taken every one! Something must be done!</b>

Stan!

Oh Lord, what have we done...?

Shiteater-

What about air strikes?

What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?

What?! Why would you call me a pigfucker?!

You'd fuck your uncle!

HA HA HA! You burned yourself to death by lighting the fart! HA HA HA!!

Hello, Conan!

Phillip, we've been tricked and ambushed by The Conan O'Brian Show!!

What's going on Terrance?

Did you hear that, Terrance? I farted!

Oh, a new recruit, huh? Welcome to hell, kid! Relax! Take a load off!!

Well of COURSE he wants out of hell! The whole POINT of hell is that you don't WANT to be here!

Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me.

You just get cranky when you're tired, that's all.  I told you that you shouldn't have tried to carry that futon all by yourself.

Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.

Well I just want you to be impressed with what I <u>do</u>. I want you to respect my MIND.

<b>What if I, don't wanna put out? That's all you ever say Relax put out I'm a living creature, I have feelings too, I don't need this abuse from you-</b>

What if I just left?

Hey, I'm missing the party!

If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me!

We saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!

Didn't you think it was funny, Wendy?

Wendy?

No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.

I think we're moving.

I never though I'd be stuck in a wine closet with Warren Wayne.

Jesus, come on!

Well, it was nice meeting you. Enjoy the rest of the trip.

Where the hell did you come from?

And what are they doing now, Mac?

Well I guess there's no time like the present.  I'll go run a check on that room, just to show we go that extra mile for our guests.

No, I just ran it!  Why are you running it again?

That was a joke Taylor, lighten up!  Why don't you just hold them up to the lens.  I'll write them down, and once I'm through verifying them, I'll get back to you.

I don't know what you're talking about!

Look we gave you what you asked for.  It checks out didn't it?! What more do you want from us!

Idiot...

Well don't drag your ass.  There won't be much of a window for us to link up.  We'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours.

It's time we lock coordinates.

This ship is going down in a blaze of glory!

Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions!

Now I got enough air and supplies to make another complete orbit in the pod!  You're just gonna have to pick me up later.

Well, more power to you.  Me, I start to bug out after too much time out here.

We're going to die.

It's getting hard to breathe...

Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?

What are we going to do?

We don't.

Supposing we could get out of this room?  Is there anything we could do to reach the bridge?

And suppose you couldn't hold out?

If I could get to the bridge I could send the distress signal.

Be careful, you don't want to puncture the suit.

Do you want some advice?

We don't have enough suits to get the others out.

Dawn.  Come in.

Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?

Sooner than later.

I never thought this would happen.  No premonitions, nothing.

In that case, I accept.

I'm fine.

No, just enjoying the view.

Yes Mac, but the guests are requesting it.  It will reduce the level of negative feedback.

What is happening around here!!!

Carlo!

I'm homesick.

Look.  We're talking about life and death here.  I don't know why we're even having this conversation.

What the hell is that?

Mac, I have a favor to ask you. Mac looks at Taylor -

Mac, what about the suit compartments on this level?  Can they be accessed?

Ok Mac...  I'll talk to you on this. I want to find a way to get to the bridge, then I want you to come back.

Is it safe for human transport?

You a mini-golfer?

Hey, cut it out Sid, that tickles. I'm serious! You guys are related, right?

Hey, you still here?

Buzz, Mr. Kastle wants to talk to you.

Bowling used to be so pure, so...All- American. Breeze sings along with Caruso and pretends to conduct.

How do you know, you don't even speak Latin?

You got an 8-track tape player on purpose, just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin' opera.

Bowling was the most incorruptible sport. No megalomillionaires, no 

How do you turn this thing off?

The Faz sure took care a her.  Breeze makes a nasal GRUNT as he tries to suppress a snigger. Sid - trying to keep a straight face - elbows him. Sid and Breeze approach the coffin. Breeze pulls an orange whip out of a paper bag and carefully places it on the coffin lid.

Yeah, and make it extra muddy, I didn't sleep a zee last night. Sheila fills a cup. Buzz lifts it to his mouth, his hands trembling.

You look like you're something on the lanes.

What's on your mind, Miles?

And look at that; both partners go down together. Kastle shoves the sculpture onto the floor, stands up, and crushes it under his heel. He goes over and puts his arm around Buzz.

Buzz Fazeli.

Where'd you get this ball?

You're a bullshit artist, that's what you are. You got no right to be here! Theo yanks the trophy away from Buzz.

She thinks someone's trying to kill you.

What the fuck is this?

Did that porcupine say he'd get you back on the tour?

No...

Look, kid, gimme a break. I'm an old man.  I'm runnin' on a Delrin aorta. I'm finished - dead from my ankles up.

It could just as easily have been me in that box.

So, eh, you never saw me. Right?

Listen, if straight doesn't work out, you come work for me.  Just make sure nobody's following you. Buzz's face is eerily lit by the glow of the sunset, his halo bouncing in the breeze.

You're in trouble, aren't you Buzz? You're doing something dangerous in that alley.

Theo. Howzitgoin.

I don't like to talk about it.

Knock-knock.

Who's there!

NO. I SAY KNOCK-KNOCK! You say who's there. I say who's there and then you say who who. You're not playing right.  Knock-knock.

JUNIOR!  You're supposed to say JUNIOR WHO! I'm going to have to hurt you. Theo and Junior circle one another.

No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.

What did your dad tell you to do to Buzz? Theo scrambles up the lane on hands and knees. Junior catches him, grabbing his ankles.

What did you do to Buzz?

We're having a party for you, boy. Cake and shish-k-bob, just like you love. Junior cringes away from the light.

I have someone for you to play with Junior.

That's some pinfall. Almost a 133 average. Her ball's flat, she needs to work on her spin control.

Think of this business like a big aquarium. You gotta have some sharks to eat the dirt at the bottom so the guppies can swim free at the top. 

Nice set-up.

A guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling. You got ambition like a...like a...blowtorch. You go for what you want and anything that gets in your way - PSSSHHT! -  shish kebabs.  Maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good.  I think I could help you, Theo.

I bet you didn't know that you and Junior have something in common, Theo: Junior can't bowl anymore either. Isn't that right Junior? Kastle SLAMS the ketchup bottle down on Junior's right hand. The table settings jump from the shock. Junior sits impassively, his face a blank.

You're using Theo for your own deviant purposes!

Leave him alone!

Don't go near the bowling alley.

I just hold it loosely with both hands?

Like this?

Kinda tough on the butt.

Whoa.

Unfortunately what he wants is you.

What do you think my dad's gonna do for you?

Ha! And what do you have to do for him?

What? Be my body guard?  Here's my body, Theo. Guard it. For my dad's sake. For your career. Sheila starts to unbutton her bowling shirt.

I don't think your new outfit suits you, Theo.

Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man.

You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.

I'm afraid you'll hurt him.

It. Bouncy-bouncy. Fucked. He tried to squeeze my fucking head off. What did you say to him? When they reach each other, they stop. Sheila seems to weigh her answer.

Where are you going?

Why did you come back?

You don't get two chances with Junior.

Theo, Buzz is dead.

What makes you think you know me so well that you can give me an ultimatum? Huh?

Very professional.

You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it?

Some unfinished business.

Aagh! Stop! Those are my bowling fingers!

Why is Junior's watch in that coffin? Something stinks around here.

Fletcher, get away from there...

Fletcher!  Now!

How big is this spacecraft?

There's heat coming the door.

Norman!

They told me about sixty hours.

Back at the door -- I asked you to back away.

There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed.  My procedures.  And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely.

Direction's east coming!

But you've tested it?

Where is it?

What was that?

Don't pull it, Norman.  It'll start a <u>fire</u> we can't stop.  Norman?

Thank you, Colonel.

Good.  Security's been our biggest worry.  Now that you're here we can shut this thing down tight.

We're moving fast considering the storm.

A thousand?  An airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water -- I don't want to sound pessimistic here, but I assume there are no survivors.

What is it?  A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite?

-- dating the crash at least that old.

Your report's become our bible down here, Dr. Johnson.  We've been carrying out each of your recommendations -- one by one -- to the smallest detail.

What is it, Norman?

Don't get hysterical, Norman.

Look, the ships are clearing out. They're taking us topside in a matter of minutes.  Someone can check him out there, if it's that imprtant.

But sir --

I'm not paranoid.  I know Beth.  She can be drastic.

Great, okay.  Ask him about his weapons.

What for?

What caused it?

Nothing, sir.

So?  What's the problem?

It's a single sequence repeated over and over.

Are you enjoying yourself, Harry, because I don't know what the hell you're doing.

I'd also like it noted --

Ted, get her away from the door.

Some sort of lead or something.

But what does it do?  This... sphere.

She says jellyfish are a delicacy. You know, I never knew that.

I want a name.  A real name.  This thing's full name, rank and serial number.

It won't register.  It's too big to image.

Beth, look, can I trust you with a little secret?

That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about?

It's bullshit.  The report's a joke.

To the spacecraft.  To investigate.

What do you expect?  For them to bring it up here?

Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here.  In the ocean.  70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman.  That's first grade geography.

Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made.  Have you said anything to Barnes about this?

Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  Don't jeopardize this.

Norman!

Me?  Well, I was wrapped in seaweed. It itched for a while, but I survived.  Beth, do you find it... curious that we're seeing all this life down here.  Nothing, and then these enormous flocks of squid.  Then jellyfish?

Wait a minute.

You knew about the squid not being normal.  Before Fletcher went out there?

... He lied to us.  He left us down here.

"Although advised of risks, all personnel elect to remain down for duration of storm to continue investigation of alien sphere and associated spacecraft.  Signed, Barnes, USN."

You, me and Harry?

Four days?

The sub's a 100 feet in front of you.  You see it?

Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just nervous.

The refridgerator.

None of this was here before.

Damn it, Norman.  I swear.  I had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up.

"Our fisherman frequently see some that are more than four feet long. Some skeletons of squids...

Remember when we first spoke to Jerry, Barnes kept asking for Jerry's real name?  But Harry never would?  He didn't because he was afraid the screen would say "Harry", instead of Jerry.  We weren't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to Jerry, we were talking to Harry... or a part of Harry.

He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things.

It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real.

Looks like some sort of code.

Ulcers.

Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.

What's that?

"20 cc's of parasolutrine in combination with 6 cc's of paracin given IV produces deep sleep suitable for emergency surgical procedures... no cardiac side effects ... REM activity is surpressed... "

Doesn't say.

You don't think I put something in it, do you?

How do you feel about snakes?

What are they doing down here?  In the bathroom?  Suddenly appearing.

Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?

Against what?  Harry's unconscious. He's not a threat.

I never went in that sphere.

That's bullshit.

I'm not scaring you, am I Norman?  I hope I'm not frightening you.  The last thing I want to do is frighten you.  You feel okay, don't you?

I promise --

It's your choice.  Because it's not safe for you to be awake.  To be walking around.  To be thinking about things.

Of course you're going to deny it. You want to blame someone else.  You want to blame Beth.  Because you hate Beth.

Where is it coming from, Beth?

Oh please, don't shrink me, Norman. Not now.

Don't tell me about me.  I already know too much.

Oh, sure.  Here.  Anything else, Beth can get you?  Some more chicken, perhaps.  Let Beth check the fridge.

Top shelf, is it?

Get away from me!

How's that?

I don't get it.

Well, what's your theory?

Our habitat, I mean.  This place can't handle another attack.

Is it coming from our own computer?

How are you feeling, Norman?

Not a clue.

It's what's in that sphere, isn't it, Harry?  Whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it's going to kill you.

What happens on page 87?  Have you ever read page 87?

You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.

What do you mean?  She's not here?

She's cracking, Norman.

Wisconsin's your answer.

How much time you figure to get to the surface?

C'mon, Norman!

Gimme a second --

You know how to work this thing?

Less than a minute, we're never gonna make it.

There is one possibility.

It's just like swimming, Norman... You know how to swim, don't you?

Easy Ted, we're not mining gold.

A spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it?  Someone went to a lot of trouble.  Try again.

Why would this ship carry instructions in English?

We take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal.  Yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper.  But there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere.  Not even a scratch.

Meaning it didn't land in the water.

... I asked myself, why would the sphere be using a code?  If you're trying to communicate, why use a code?

Barnes.  He's very eager to meet you. Been calling us every half hour to see if you're arrived.

What report?

Must be another Johnson then.  Been flying so many scientists out here -- can't keep everyone straight.

Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.

Well, how about we wait and see what Harry comes up with?

What was it?

Has Harry spoken with Jerry?

There's nothing on the news about a crash.  Did he say what airline?

Four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume.

I'll get the information.

Good morning!

I don't see why.  I don't believe we've ever met.

I know who you are.  Stand up so that we can talk properly.  You're embarrassing me.  I'm not that important.

You saw through me?

Are you all right?

What do I do?

I can't do it.  I'll get hit.

I'll tell you, Luke, and this is between you and me.  The star force isn't all it's cracked up to be. Frankly, it's a bore, and it's going to stay that way as long as this system is neutral...

The academy is fantastic... Of course, they won't teach you anything about flying you don't already know.  Most of the instructors are very conservative pilots.  You can fly circles around them... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down-right amazing, and you get a lot of discipline... but after you graduate, don't join the star force -- go free-lance.  It's the only way to get into the action... I can't wait until my hitch is up.

Six hours, huh?  Well, that's your ship there.  You're blue five.  You stay glued to me.  I don't want any independent operations out there. Personally I think it's foolish for them to be sending fresh kids out on a job like this.  This is no joy ride we're going on.

Should we alert the Sith Lords?

As close as we can make out, it appears to be a Corellian gypsy vessel... It's not under power.

We must hurry to the base.  We have little time before the Death Star arrives.

You got yourself a ship.  We can leave as soon as you're ready.

Maybe you should just drop us off. I'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk.

I think she's going to be all right.

Get to the ship!

I don't pick up any life form concentration down there.  She'd better be right.

I am Luke Starkiller at your service.

That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.

What happened?  I'm sorry, sir, I must have taken a bad step...

I think we're going to need them. Blast it!

See Threepio... do you copy?

Holy Maker, Threepio.  I forgot...

Our love will grow, dear, year by year...

Whad'ya talkin  about ?

Mobile Infantery rules !

Lieutenant's bought the farm. Where's the Sarge...?

We'll take this high ground. Lookouts there and therte and up there. If the bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood, we'll be the first to know.

You still haven't kissed her yet ? Don't lie.

Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for Starside R&D ?

Johnny, I'm sorry it had to be your unit on Planet P. That mission had a very low survival probability...

So what are you doing later ?

I'm all ears.

In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up.

Thanks. You read my mind. Third watch always seems to last forever.

Fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. You'd probably get a promotion out of it.

Carmen...?

No, I... Oh, Zander, I'm a fool.

Good for you.

She's flying starships !

Eeuch !

None at all... We won.

Johnny Rico, you're jealous !

You're late.

It's funny. Sometimes I forget. Then it hits me, and I can't stop crying.

Johnny...! I thought you were dead !

I thought you were KIA, Johnny...

AAAAAAAAAAAAAA !

Where's Lieutenant Barcalow ?

This is Rodger Young, we're going down... Repeat, this is Rodger Young, we're going down...!

Report.

What ? You think I joined the Mobile Infantery because of you ?

It stinks, you goin.

You used to dance...

Diz, see what you can do.

What frequency ?

Oh, my, what's that ?

You'll resign, and that's all there is to it. It might look bad, but if that's the worst you suffer...

Are your parents currently citizens ?

Please complete this sentence. I want to be citizen because...

Well, yeah, sure...

Hello... Oh, Johnny...!

Well, of course you should come home immedietly !

Don't get any ideas. She's my girl.

Best in the Fleet !

Let's go.

How bad are you, pal ?

This is Rodger Young... What's going on down there ? We're taking plasma ! We have Orion P-11 as clear !

Inside 4th brigade compound ? That's crazy !

You. Tell me the moral difference, if any, between the citizen and the civilian ?

Rico, you're acting Sergeant now. My last Sergeant lost the com pack. Put together a search team and find the radio shack. We need retrieval.

What's that look like to you, Rico ?

Rico, tell'em to glass this goddam planet. I've never seen so many bugs upstairs at the same time...

Who is...'V'ger'...?

The Creator is that which created V'ger.

The examination is a normal function.

<U>Why</U>?!

Then V'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices.

Yes.

Does V'ger object to the presence of the two carbon units?

As I stated, V'ger calls to the Creator.

And when V'ger melds? What will happen to you?

Sir! Airlock four has been opened; a thruster suit is reported missing!

I'm taking over the Center seat. I'm sorry, Will.

You'll stay aboard as Executive Officer... a temporary grade reduction to Commander.

Yes.

My experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew...

... but I still recommend further simulation study.

You saved the ship.

Granted.

If our Executive Officer has no objections...?

<U>Computer off</U>!

We could have cut it off at the main computer...

Exactly.  And you did have a 'relationship' with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.

Then V'ger believes the Creator to be a <U>machine</U> too.

Forward motion, Captain...!

That transmitter is a vital link between V'ger and the Creator. 

Was he difficult?

And in you, too, Lieutenant.

Time to impact...?

Hold station...!

We're losing the pattern...!

Also -- there was nothing in your report about <U>why</U> you're here.

It appears that our message has been understood, Captain.

The 'puzzlement' I sensed was fleeting... minor...  ... as if carrying a sense of our insignificance, Captain.

Have you been able to analyze <U>any</U> of this...?

Spock? Concerned about his chances?

Bridge, cancel rescue teams.  Spock, what in the hell are you doing out here!

Were you right? Spock? V'ger is a living machine...?

Captain, the orbital device will      not be triggered for twenty-two       minutes...                           

That object out there is less than two days from Earth, Mister Scott. We've got to intercept while it still is out there!

Dock control reports ready, sir.

The third one is moving off too -- a fourth one is forming...

Evening, Annie.

You're doing a <u>Play</u>...

I just got kicked off my first movie.

Could you tell me when's the next train?

But, but but but...

...that...he <u>sees</u> that...

...that it has been vouchsafed to him.

Goodbye.

So that the Old Mill, the Old <u>Mill</u> represents...the wheel of fate is that too...

...that's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...thats its <u>purpose</u>, <u>isn't</u> it...

Cause, cause, it's...it's the <u>simple</u> things, that...

Hi.

I...I decided to give it another chhh...

In fact, in fact, in fact, I'm not sure if I'm giving <u>them</u> a second chance, or they're giving it to me.  That's the truth.  The truth's best, don't you think?

I <u>can</u>?

Uh huh.

What are you doing down there?

Great.  Who is it...?

Would you put on your cl...  Just leave it outside.

It's for your finger.

Hi.

Thank you.

Don't you think you should put them in water?

What about...what about...it's so presumptuous of me, to be, to be telling <u>you</u> how to wr...

Ah.  Ah.  Ah...

...he stuck a fishhook in it. 

Hi.

Would you like to <u>see</u> it?  I've got the key back at my store...

How's your star?

Press still works.

Pelting down out there.

We could live up here, live up in the country.

To print the newspaper.  And I'd come to <u>write</u>.  To write.  To write.  Right here in the office.

Well, I could <u>get</u> a rolltop desk.

Lookit that, up already.

Well, I for one, am glad of a little diversion and I'm glad they're here...

It's all over between us.  I've found someone else.

Yes, Maude, it is.  It is a <u>very</u> good play.

Town ain't got no courthouse.

A jacket for five dollars...I can buy this town for fifty bucks.

It's Marty on the Coast -

They think it's your First Wife...

...overcome by the events around her, the presence of a high-powered...

Whyn't you learn your lines?

Well, I'm pretty impolite.  Would you like some?

How old are you?

Then I hope you wouldn't tell anyone that I gave you this.

Nice town that you've got here.

...wouldn't that be dangerous?

I mean, okay, fine, but it's a motion <u>Picture</u>.

She's a <u>waitress</u>.

You don't need "Hi I've just come from the restaurant."

Alright.  Let's...  Page five, the fucking <u>horse</u> dies.  You know, <u>she</u> could be in the movie, she could, she's got a good face, she could be the Doctor's...uh, why does it have to be his, uh, <u>wife</u>...?  It could be his...

No, I...just...just Joe, just Joe...

We're going to discuss the scr...you wanna come along...?

If your memory was as long as your dick, you'd be in good shape.  How long since you almost went to jail for this shit?

Can we try to keep our pants buttoned and get out of this town in one piece?

Well, now, Mr. Barrenger, I'm very sorry, in fact, I'm as sorry as I could be, <u>but</u>...

Nobody touched me, I was at home.

I want to tell you something, Wally, he's a pussycat.  <u>My</u> thing is to see everybody does what they said they would and I have to do that.  Now:  what is this you want <u>Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars</u> to do what you're being paid to, you already <u>signed</u> you'd do...?  What is that?

Get him on the phone.

I love Jewish men.

Look, look, I like you <u>very much</u>...

Will you help me out...?

Hi.  I hope I'm not disturbing...

This is Joe White.

What, what's there to <u>think</u> about?  The scene's perfect...I, I get to say...

"...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go."

...I can't do it, Wally...

I, uh...  I've always thought so...  Well, you just get an idea, and try to find the best way to express it in pictorial form.  I've written a letter to the studio and to SAG protesting...  Bill: get a copy of that letter...!  I just wanted to tell you that I am <u>past</u> chagrined, I'm <u>mortified</u> at the way you were spoken to...

...yes...

That's cor...

Why not?

-- she's got 'religion.'

...little woman has gone crazy about our dinner party...City Council...?  What's the trouble...?

She was in the car with Bob Barrenger last night.  And she was injured coming home from a love tryst, so...

He didn't have to tell...

What's in the case?

Mmmm.  You have children?

Half a buck I'd put him in jail...

I...

I...?

My <u>wife's having a baby</u>...

We're out of money.

Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.

Why?

The movie's about <u>purity</u>.  So we don't <u>show</u> her breasts.  We show them to <u>him</u>, her back to the camera.

Know?  They could draw them from memory. You're fantastic.  What a find you are. Get outta here.  We need the Dead Horse Scene.

I've got a date.

...that's just so <u>narrow</u>...

And my company sues your ass for sixty million dollars.

Well, you call him, and call me back, but this is it, pal, you <u>fuck</u> with me, and I'm going to tear out your heart and piss on your lungs through the hole in your <u>chest</u>.   And the best to Marion...  Where have <u>you</u> been?

You can't write it?

How do they know that, you told them?

What did you say to them...?

How do you know you saw it?

I...

Oh yeah, I'm really gonna eat carbohydrates...

It's just a formality.

I don't got the money.

<u>Find</u> it.

Yes?  Hello, Mr. Mayor.  Nothing, just an, an unfortunate...  It's the Mayor, he's saying...

My golly, you know?  All my life I grew up in the city, but every summer...would you like a cigar?

...not at all...

On your "permit," but that is less than a formality.

I <u>am</u> the City Council.  We meet Friday, and I...

Well, these things happen.  <u>Purpose</u> of my call, my wife wanted to know what brand of <u>cigarettes</u> Mr. Barrenger smokes, so she could lay some out tonight...we got the list of his dietary <u>requirements</u>...

Drive a man to drink.  Took me near half an hour, get across the street yesterday.

...the damn thing...

She coulda done better than him.

Where are we?

We need a new name for the movie. Where's the writer?

&quot;Those who travel far and near this will make you DISAPPEAR!&quot;

I'm not upset.  Why would I be upset?

I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up.

She is only the <u>Princess</u> of Cool. <u>Mommy</u> is the Queen!

What's Thursd...

I don't have to listen to you!  You're not my mother.

This is my house too!

Now is that little prick still here, because if he is, I'm gonna rip his fucking <u>heart</u> out!

And Mom says anger never, never <u>solves</u> anything.  It makes every- thing <u>worse</u>.

And you<u>don't</u> tell her.  What you're going to say.

...your hating me.

I made you some cocoa.  See?

&quot;Goodnight moon, goodnight hush, goodnight mush, goodnight goodnight goodnight Gracie -- Goodnight Ben!

'In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you... held you so ti-ight'...take it, man...

Why does Rachel wear Daddy's underpants? Doesn't she have underpants of her own?

Poof!  You're happy now.

Rachel's job is she works.

Rache says I have to eat <u>lamb</u>.  I told her <u>you're</u> making me <u>spaghetti</u>!

Grammy had a different kind. There are lots of kinds.  Hers was very bad.

Ben.  God doesn't like visitors.

Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson. She does this twenty times a day.

Okay.  These are good.

Find the bird cage?

So we'll...radiate some more?

That's necessary, huh?

Which part of no don't you understand?

Planning on getting --

Rachel's not half my age.

Fine.  But I wanted to take the kids to work with me on Wednesday so I'll take Wednesday, and you can pick up that Thursday, Friday after soccer, and Saturday before riding.

The great thing about life is that things keep changing.

You want us to take him tonight? Give you some private time with Annab....

I had a lot of treatments, and they weren't any fun, but the tests show the cancer got smaller.

How do you hold down a job?  It's 8:10. You were supposed to be here at 7:00. She's missed her sunrise Groom'n Ride.

Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of the month when it's switched to Friday except in April when she rides on Thursday.  It's not that hard.  Didn't you have a mother?

Luke was in the shower this morning and Annabelle sort of walked in without knocking.

Yeh?

I am not <u>here</u> to make it easier for you.  These are <u>my</u> children.  They don't want to <u>be</u> with you.

I need practice.

I have an appointment this after- noon.  I need someone to take them to the park.

Look, you've never liked me...

You bet you are.

I don't, but...

And cigarettes.  I smoke, too.

Oh, my God.

And you said...?

So.  Hopeful.

I really look like shit.

He's relentless.  A <u>major</u> asshole.

Can I say one thing?  I mean, the <u>last</u> thing I want to do is inter- fere on the Brad thing, b...

Yah?  Well, even the best mom in the world, the smartest, the wisest, whatever.  Needs to know when to find a Plan B.  Cos Plan A <u>is</u> not and <u>will</u> n...

It's just not the right time t...

Hey, you haven't quit on you, I'm sure as hell not gonna.  I just mean, I'm juggling a lot right n...

It's the same choice you made.

I know you, huh?  The car pools, he measles, the PTA.  It's not gonna be enough for you in the long run.  You have to think long term.

My advice to you?  Don't die.

Somehow, his blanket always looked like a cape, even the nurse said that.  He <u>loves</u> to hear that story, over and over.  How he was born a magician.

Looks nice enough to m...

Now we're going to have a fight, you and I.

And I'm going to win.

You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>!

You think <u>I</u> didn't have some dirty words for that little putz?  You think <u>I</u> couldn't figure out some low blows?

Doing the <u>right</u> thing.  Knowing who you <u>are</u>, inside.  Not <u>caving</u> to peer pressure, or <u>lowering</u> yourself to that level, <u>steering</u> your <u>own</u> course...

She likes a Stolie, no ice.

Well, it's the Jack Kennedy Syndrome, huh?  You die young, you always look golden.  Perfect.  The memory kind of burnishes the image, and...

Ben never mentioned it.

You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's <u>happiness</u> has been wrapped up in <u>you</u>, every moment...

Uh-oh.  I mention marriage, all of a sudden...  Ve <u>haff</u> to ta...

Look.  I know they hate me.

Why are you taking this out on <u>him</u>?

Oh my God.  Are you serious?

It's forever you know.

She's not gonna die.

I needed some time away.

We make our lives, one step at a time.  We do the best we can.  The truth about the future?  A promise. Is only a hope.

Where you goin'?

Something came up.  C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three...

Out! Leave the table!

Well, I'm supposed to watch Schindler's List for homework. The movie's like almost four hours. And then I'm supposed to write a report on survivors.  You know any survivors, Dad?

Welcome to the show, Scooby.

Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?

Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?

Who is Jesus?

Maybe it's for the bestI mean, if he was guilty of doing  something wrongPeople who are bad should be killed. Don't you think so?

I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is.

We're not ready.

Mom?

Sure!...

Was anyone in my room today?

Well...yes. If it hadn't been for Hitler, he wouldn't have had to leave Europe. We would have been...European.

You're tired of me. I can tell.

You've lost interest...You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.

What do you want?

What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?

Marcus...You'll write something better next time!

Which is it? You gotta keep your focus straight.

Fuck!

Get the hell outta here!

You're welcome.  Dad?Would you let me try hypnotizing you now?

Come here, give me a hug!

I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just didn't expect to run into you here, that's all.

Yeah, um, then...are you alone?

You're not.

That's good.

Oh.  Do you think I have a potential as a writer?

Fuck me hard!

Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman.

So what's going on?

Oh, no, not any more. No, um, I kind of came to terms with myself, I realized I had done what I had to do. And it was time to move on.

That's too bad.

That's good. So then what do you do now?

How many?

Gee, your Dad's smart.

You want some?

You a pervert?

Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?

Is this to like get into Sundance?

Can I see what you have so far?

What is most important to you?

Yeah. He went to Harward.

Oh, my God, Scooby! I'm so sorry...I'm so, so sorry...

I don't know what hit us!  We had them trapped on the stairwell.  They could be anywhere now.

I said I'll lead.

They probably have guards on the roof--and they're gonna be firing at me--not you! ATKINS What makes you so sure?

Are the labs in operation?

Come on, drink up.

Why the hell didn't you tell us this was at stake!

What about Cooper--where is he?

Looks like Richter isn't acting alone--he's heading into some dangerous waters.

This was taken when Richter was arrested in Washington state, 1985. He was charged with interstate arms trafficking, skipped bail, and has since been a fugitive.

And--of course there is the human cost, which is incalculable.

So, what are we looking at White?

Apparently, this project is--unique. But it's heavily protected--all formulas are heavily codified!

How goes the roll call?

My crew is going to work alongside with your men, don't worry--we're a team!

Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--

Are we adrift--

Get your men to do it!

They must have got their hands on a test vial!

I have your word, Mister President?

Where is this...thing?

The source was...shall we say, completely reliable.

Damn you, de Sade!  You know as well as I do that this was the act of a mentally sick man - a single individual, whose crack-up can probably be traced to the strains and tensions caused by your country.

And now, Mister President, I must return at once to my embassy to communicate this reassuring news to the Premier.

Major?...Major?  I'm Colonel "Bat" Guano, 701 Battalion.

Now, snap out of it, fella!

We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?

Sure I do.  There was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed General Ripper.

Now look, I'm picking up this ordinary telephone.  See?...Hello?...Hello?... Nuts, the lines must still be disconnected.  The General had us disconnect... 

Ceida Pietraszkiewicz...P...I...E... T...R...A...S...Z...K...I...E...W... I...C...Z.

May I be stupid enough to inquire WHY IN HELL THE BASE COMMANDER OF THE 843d BOMB WING DID A THING LIKE THAT ???

Under a condition red alert, the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops.

Combat Operations Center, Major Mandrake speaking.

That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.

Let me worry about that, Major. I've still got my red line to the Air Command.

No calls at all.  With or without my say-so. My voice can be imitated too, Major.

Are you trying to be insubordinate?

I hope not.  Now, as soon as you do what I told you, have Plan-R radioed to the Wing.

Are you hard of hearing, Major?

You're a good officer, Major, and you're perfectly right to bring these facts to my attention.

Now, as soon as you've done that, double- up on all base security teams.  Our enemies are plenty smart, and there might even be an attack on the base by saboteurs.

What's the gun for, General Ripper?

I didn't mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either, Major.

You know the regulations well, Major.

That's a good question, Major.  Maybe if you think hard, you can think of the answer yourself.

Suppose that were the case?

Don't fret about it, Major.  There's nothing anyone can do about it now.  I'm the only one who knows the three-letter code group for the CRM-114.

Well, General -- I was wondering, why are you doing this?  I mean why do you want to start the war?

I guess so.

I don't know, sir.  But they're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. War just doesn't make sense any more, for anybody.

Go on, Major.  You fascinate me.

Major, you're talking like one of them!

And you'd like to see that?

General, now that you've done that, I beg you to recall the Wing.

Yes, sir.  The base commander, General Ripper, selected Plan-R?

General Jack D. Ripper, sir.

I'm not certain, Mister President.  But I believe it was four.

What's the target.

Yeah, to see if we're on our toes.

Then this is it.

Missiles!  Sixty miles off, heading in fast.  Steady track, they look like beam riders.

Twenty!  Twelve o' clock.

Shouldn't be bad.  Might even help.  But my guess is we're going to have to paddle our way back.

Look, I'm shot - it hurts.

Roger.

Could you take her up right now, King?  Other- wise we'll get kind of close to the fireball.

Listen, King, old buddy.  On behalf---

That's what I said.

Check target approach.

Yes, Major.

He's dead, all right.

I mean pulling a stunt like that.

Lieutenant Zogg, what do our orders say about the authentication of orders during an attack mission?

The CRM-114 is smashed, right?

There are plenty of traitors and spies running around loose.

First lesson in War College:  Never under- estimate your enemy.

I asked you a question, Lothar!

I think it's okay, King.  They should go off on impact.

Well, it would probably help if you took it ...sort of...straight down.

I thought I'd go along for the ride.

Thanks, King.  I've always wanted to take one of these big babies in.

When they emerge, a good deal of present real estate and machine tools will still be recoverable, if they are moth-balled in advance.  I would guess they could then work their way back to our present gross national product within twenty years.

Um-hm.

Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony.

Yeah, we all want to see him. So when's he coming?

It's really not about anything.

A cloud.

Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it.

Your a nurse?

Mm. Hey, what are you doing now?

Guy should cut down on his caffeine intake.

Oh yeah? Oh, how'd you ship it over there, man? Federal Express? Hm? By the time it got there it'd be way cold and coagulated. Total waste. Cheese be stuck to the cardboard.

But, so, Pony's comin' by here to the corner?

I don't know. Later. I don't know.

No, no.

You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit.

No, I'm not saying that I wouldn't love it.

A long, long, long...

So, do you guys want to do something, go someplace or something like that?

Hey. Hey. Are you trying to get a hold of Sooze?

Hey, you know me.

I know, man.

Yeah, that's what I'm trying to tell you. That chick Erica?

She's dead?

Fuck her! Come on, let's go.

Yeah.

Hey! On behalf of Burnfield, I present to you the keys to the city.

Great.

Yeah, he's told me. Burnfield. We all hear about Burnfield.

Oh, you were in the band?

Am I fucking him?

Yes! Free concert!

You better! Yes!

Hey, call the cops! Call 'em, call 'em right now, man. Maybe my cousin Jerry will show up. He'll definitely take your word over mine. You can tell him about the trespassing. I'll tell him about how you sell beer to minors.

It's okay.

In two more years I'll have an engineering degree. We'll sell the store, we'll move away from Burnfield and the store and you standing here.

No, but I heard it was great.

So tell us, man. Party time, trashin' hotel rooms, babes around the clock?

No, no, no, no, no, it's new.

Hey, I'm glad you put truth in your song, man. That's important.

Come on, man. Sh, sh, sh.

You were a shitty lineman and now your a shitty cop. Yeah, blow me, I'm drunk.

So you, like, come from a town like this or...?

Oh, me too. Middle-class.

Yes.

A Porsche.

You just seem to know all these things about me and I don't know anything about you, you know. What kind of music do you like?

You think I'm rich and you hate me.

You know, it was the biggest mistake of my life.

Erica.

We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.

That's what I mean.

I know. It's okay.

Mm-hm. I'm a big girl. I can take care of myself. If I didn't want to be here, I'd be in a limo right now with a bunch of kids looking for Chinese food.

He says we got to be at the radio station at seven a.m. Can you handle that?

Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.

Erica, you coming?

Buff, sit. You know what I mean though? Somebody ought to crack that guy with a baseball bat.

Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land.

Oh, no, you wanted to get together with your close friend, Pony, the rockstar. I understand. So you, do you, want us to, leave?

Jeff, Jeff, if you want to be alone with Pony, you know, that's, that's fine with us.

Wow, you're cute when you're angry.

No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying I don't need a limousine to know who I am, alright?

I mean, you know, at least I admit that I don't know. I know that things are fucked up beyond belief and I know that I have nothing original to say about any of it, alright? I don't have an answer. I don't have a fucking message.

Yeah. Yeah, no, you're right. It's no big deal, you know. Guy probably has his arm around her right now, holding her close, nudging her titty with his elbow, talking about the deep significance of his music, while she looks up at him with her big brown eyes. In a few minutes they'll be back at the Four Seasons. You ever, you ever stayed in one of those places?

No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!

You hit her? Oh, wait, wait a minute. Why'd you hit her?

This is my home.

Hey, w-why don't you see if he's hiring, you know? Get an application?

Why we're just standing here.

You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.

Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get like this, My name's Jeff.

No, no, no. Y-you know what? Y-your packing your bags, you're jumping into the unknown because some conceptual artist who teaches at a community college is having a mid-life crisis and he wants to sleep with some girl half his age, so he tells you you have talent.

No, no. It's an honest question. What are you trying to communicate?

Yes, you asshole.

About things that are important to me.

Your completely missing the point.

No, no, no. I'm not being cynical, I'm being honest.

I stand for honesty! I stand for some level of truth!

Can I talk here? Let me talk.

I can't wait till Pony gets here, you know? Have a conversation with a human being?

Jeff. Jeff.

What?

So what do you wanna do?

Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?

Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?

Oh, hi. I thought you guys got lost.

What?

No, no, I have to talk to you.

What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.

No, it's not...

Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.

Wow. A gold record, man, that's great. So you're, you're like living the wild life now, huh?

Yeah.

The prom. That's funny.

Really?

So, um, Pony, where are you staying? Are you staying at your mother's house?

W-wait a minute, wait a minute.

I'm sorry. I, I gotta...

I don't know.

You know, why do you call me names? You know, I never hurt you. I'm only working here.

Pony, oh my god!

Like?

Yeah, so what do you guys do next? I mean, what's your band do now?

You're not serious.

Yeah, come on, play it.

"Drove down the highway there was a big jam The family had died There inside their minivan There was a backup It went on for miles But as bad as it was It was gone after a while"  Chorus here.  "You may think there's nothing to it and the truth is hard to see To be an invisible man is a remarkable thing to be thing to be thing to be"

Yeah. Burnfield, Pizza and Puke capital of the world.

Me?

Yeah? Well, what'd she say?

The bar at the hotel? She told you that? What did she say exactly?

Oh, come on, Pony. I'm just kidding. Wow, you rock stars are really sensitive, huh? You know, there's a life on the road?

What are you going to do? Hm?

I don't, I don't remember. What do I owe you?

Yeah. Yeah. How's the air force, Tim?

Fuck.

Holy shit.

Ahh!  Baby's got two heads!!!

Di, are you okay?  We can skip the girl party this week.

Hello?

No.

... I don't know.  Probably not.

Well, if I had to guess...  I'd say that was the sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who's going to be a daddy of his own...  Jack, do you know what I see here?

I see a flower.  And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.

Oh... What are you working on?

Hat-trick?

Listen, Kansas, I know you dream of springing your mom some day...

Oh, thank G-d!  I'm not just super fat!

Hey.  Eyes on your own belly!

Yeah, hold on.

Hello?

Well, we'll each probably want one - so let's make it five.  Five should do it.

I-I didn't mean to say "whore," Diane. I just hear it so much at church - it kinda came flying out of my head.

You want us to help you pick up?

Hannah, we've...

...my Sunday School teacher says that in prison, women shove broom sticks up your...

Really...

It must be about that appalling script of hers.  What can I say to her? What can I say?

We're ready with the shot, Mr. deMille.

Give me your coat.

Say, you're not really smuggling opium these days,  are you?

Good party.

Sure, this'll go on all night.

Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.

This is Miss Kramer.

Name dropper.

I've been hoping to run into you.

I didn't.

Is there someplace we can talk?

I've got some ideas myself.  One of them being this is New Year's Eve.  How about living it up a little?

How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?

With a wildly beating heart.

Hello, Artie.  Good evening, Miss Schaefer.

Dark Windows.  I got him all hopped up about it.

I was afraid of that.

If you get a hundred thousand for it, you buy me a box of chocolate creams.  If you get an Oscar, I get the left foot.

Look, if you don't mind, I haven't got time to listen to the whole plot ...

Sorry.  It's your baby now.

Look, Betty, It can't be done. It's out.

So do I.

Good.

I was born just two blocks from this studio.  Right on Lemon Grove Avenue.  Father was head elec- trician here till he died.  Mother still works in Wardrobe.

Third.  Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White.  I come from a picture family.  Naturally they took it for granted I was to become a great star.  So I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing. Then the studio made a test.  Well, they didn't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little.  I went to a doctor and had it fixed.  They made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose -- only they didn't like my acting.

Not once.  What's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras? It's really more fun.

That's no shampoo.  It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile.  How old are you anyway?

Hers.

Want something to drink?  There's always champagne on ice, and plenty of caviar.

Come on where? Back to a one-room apartment that I can't pay for? Back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not?

We've missed you too, dear.

I had some trouble with my car. Flat tire.  I pulled into your garage till I could get a spare. I thought this was an empty house.

I'm sorry, and I'm sorry you lost your friend, and I don't think red is the right color.

Look at them in the front offices -- the master minds! They took the idols and smashed them.  The Fairbankses and the Chaplins and the Gilberts and the Valentinos. And who have they got now?  Some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl

And you have written pictures, haven't you?

How long is a movie script these days?  I mean, how many pages?

This is to be a very important picture.  I have written it myself.  Took me years.

Well?

You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.

Shouldn't we wait for the others?

What's the matter with you?

That's what I told them.

What doctor?

Uh-huh?

Why?  Her career?  She got enough out of it.  She's not forgotten. She still gets those fan letters.

No, I haven't.  I suppose all the waxworks are coming?

Sure you are.  And we're not help- ing her any, feeding her lies and more lies.  Getting herself ready for a pioture ...  What happens when she finds out?

You don't believe me?  Look in the garage.

Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?

Haven't got a thing.

So you need three hundred dollars? Of course, I could give you three hundred dollars.  Only I'm not going to.

You do not deny having killed this man, Miss Desmond?

Paramount studios.

It is not Mr. deMille in person. It is someone by the name or Gordon Cole.  He says it's very important.

Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous about a baseball game?

Is he your entertainment for tonight?

A Storm Dragon?

Why did she have to show up now?

That's easy for you to say, Bianca.

Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.

At last. Ultimate Power.

My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms...

Where Superman's from? Krypton?

I'm sorry, I don't understand.

We're from different worlds.

There's one sure way to find out how you feel.

Let me kiss you.

But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her.

I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.

And you can see how you feel about me, right?

They think I have a concussion.

I know it.

Why should I believe you?

Nurse!

I'm wise to your tricks, lady.

Guess! Go on.

You can't put her out of your mind, is that it?

Why the empty cage?

What about my proposal?

Gosh, what do you suppose .that is?

Yes.

You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?

I'm sorry... I didn't know.

I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a chance since...

I'd rather not talk about it.

She did that deliberately.

Keep an eye peeled for Myra. She's out to get you.

Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's... his folks are away...

Why is he acting so strangely?

No plans for the weekend, Linda?

I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.

Balefire on you, Selena!

Nigel, get lost.

You're wasting your breath.

Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?

The Danvers. And two of your little friends.

You've run out of things to throw, Selena.

I was on Earth...

Shouldnt've done that.

Are you happy, Zaltar?

There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. That's why they send the criminals here.

Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?

You can use the wand.

Yes, mustn't stop.

What?

Not enough vodka in it.

Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name. Hey, listen, you thought it up, we'll name it after you. What's your name?

Here I am, honey, and I'm all yours.  Remember when you were Queen of the Prom? All the guys had to wait in line to get a dance.  But now there's only one name on your dance card, sweet thing, and it's --

I can't  Clark already asked me.  Didn't you?  He used to love this song.  Didn't you?  So he just said --  "Would you dance with me?"

And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated.  Isn't that terrible?

You know what's the problem?

No, the problem is --  Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis?  The Big Apricot.

That song. I remember one day I came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought -- what am I going to do with all this potato salad?

Gee, I haven't done this in years.

No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it.

No, what you said before, Could I make it in Metropolis? I've dreamed about it, sure, but I never really thought about it.  What would I do when I got there?

The dog's always doing that.  And the car's always doing that.

Well, aren't you excited?

Anyway, the reunion's just the hook for the story. What it's really about is how the typical small town's changed in the last fifteen years. how do you like this a title: Can You Go Home Again ?

So, Mr. White? Can I go ahead and make my travel arrangements?

Wow, what a beautiful sunrise!

You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.

How many sugars?

Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.

Gus, Webco, the Webster industrial complex, is a family-owned cartel. A little magnesium here, a little zinc there. Some railroads here, some farm machinery there. You follow?

Gus, do you know what I want now? I want coffee!

Wipe 'em out?

Always making yourself beautiful for me, aren't you?  So, Gus, can you make Vulcan do what I want it to? You didn't answer me, pal.  Did you hear about that prison riot last week? It seems they were complaining about rats in the cells...

What?

Uh...what channel were you watching?

Just hold on a minute. I have been doin' some thinkin'

Every oil tanker and super- tanker and super-duper-tanker in the ocean is controlled. totally, by computers. Computers to tell them where to go, how much oil to take on, where to deliver it.

Awright. I got me my electric train, mama. I finally got --  Hey, what y'all doin' up there?!

Hey, you're perfectly safe.

All right, Kent. I just hope you know what you're doing. If you really think Smallville is your big chance, go for it.

And this is...  ...Clark.  My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...

It's hard to believe... a great looking girl like you all alone like this. As she glances up at him, she is first flustered, then flattered, then...finally...just realistic:

What terrific story?

Well, don't let me keep you from anything.

Mr. White, please, it's time for you to draw this month's winning JINGO number.  The prize is an all-expenses trip to South America.

By hand. Like the pioneers did.

Well, chum? What now? Kiss the 85 thou goodbye? Pay some thief's salary while he thinks up new ways to shake the money tree?

That's what I want to know! By whom? Whom????

Vulcan is the weather satellite						our government put up in orbit to monitor the weather.

You mean...you mean...Vera! Vera! The magnitude of this!!!

Small potatoes.

Chicken feed.  If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons ---

Nice try, Butch,  but it wouldn't be effective against Superman.  You'll see! Now that he's pulled this stunt, he'll stick his nose in my oil scheme and ruin that one, too! I've got to get rid of him! I've got to!

Wait a minute! She's right! Kryptonite. I remember reading about it in an interview with him.  Nuts...

I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.

I do?

Actually, yes.

Yeah, thanks. . . . I mean, really! Posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls.  I mean,. imagine wasting a great reporter -  -- uh, reporters -- on this.  Perry White and his Sunday Magazine exposes.

A "complimentary corsage."

I was. . . uh. . . just wondering about the.. . .the.. . . the uh, arrangements.  Sleeping arrangements.

You've been under a lot of pressure lately -

I didn't think I wanted to.

You did it. You gave it all up for me. I . . . I don't know what to say.

Maybe we ought to hire a bodyguard from now on.

Hi.

Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, "It's like being married to a doctor," I said. Doctors are practically never at home. The get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. Then a voice said, " could you be a doctor's wife? Or are you too selfish . . . "

What else could I do?

I'll try to remember that . . .

A good time! Is that all you care about?!

Why didn't you go before we left?

Artemis? Do you read me?

Mr. White, the pressroom wants to know how much longer to hold the front page.

Patience, Kal-El. You begin to sound like an Earthling. SUPERMAN Mother, you speak only of honor, of sacrifice, of responsibility --

You must be freezing.

Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap!

There is something more you want. The 								greed is written on your face.

Who is this . . . Superman?

My prom was so boring. We all flew to Paris the next day to recover . . . Sometimes my whole life seems boring. I thing maybe I should just give everything away and go live among the poor people. Then I remember how smashing I look in sable . . . oh, it's all so confusing. You think I'm silly, don't you?

That sounds kind of pessimistic.

I missed you. It wasn't any fun up there with just Lois and Superman. They're so boring. Let's go do something wild!

Oh . . . my . . .

The President is about to speak. I don't think it's going to be good news.

It must have been a super effort to get out of bed, Clark.

But Superman isn't an average man.

Boys, old Lex has a secret recipe in this dish . . . call it a genetic stew. You help me place it on one of your missiles and I promise you . . . if Superman throws it into the sun, he'll get the biggest surprise of his life. I'll be able to introduce Superman to his first nightmare . . . a Nuclear Man!

Would you mind waiting for me in the visitor's gallery?

Yes, darling?

I think he's kind of cute.

This letter was addressed to Superman care of me.

Clark. He's late again.  I can't figure him out.

And your heart beats faster just thinking about him.

. . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.

Gee, Uncle Lex, I don't think this guy's much of a dancer.

Gee, Uncle Lex, I was just getting to the good part.

What was that about?

He's . . . cold. . .

What I need this for?

I am an experiment? I am freako?

Nifty, huh?  Goodnight Sweet Prince, parting is . . . inevitable  Now, destroy Superman.

Guess who? It's your old friend, Lex.

If you have any social skills, you've learned them from a rattlesnake. Just what are you up to?

I'm not going anywhere.

You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.

Superman. . .  But you're... dead!

I know, but  --

That the planet blew up on May 23, 1937. That the rocket ship with the revolting little freak in it took three years to reach Earth. Ergo?

You're a great architect, Albert.

It's very simple, Otis.  Very simple, the XK101 rocket. It's nothing, forty years ago we in the Fatherland were working on this. Five more years, we would've had it. But then  --  --  that silly war...Why, my cousin Werner had already  --

Yes, Mr. Luthor. The XK101 can travel anywhere in the world undetected. It also has a sensory device built into it so that it can detect any obstacle in its path and avoid it. It just goes around it or over it.  The XK101 never quits! It will not stop until it reaches its pre-targeted target!

A hot story, huh?

She's in California. That's wild enough, I guess.

Clark...Son...that...thing you did with the Sheriff today... those...stunts...you don't do those things at school, do you?

Mother...

Do you know where you're headed?

I know. He sends a check every week to his dear gray-haired old mother.

Not...gray.

Are there any more at home like you?

Well, how are you enjoying your first day on the job?

See? Didn't I tell you this was a tough town?

It isn't worth getting a heart attack over, Lois.

It wasn't a trick!

You're just jealous.

Is that what they're calling him?

You! The girl from the volcano!  Kryptonite...

What are you doing here?

Streets, Sunlight. When was the last time I saw sunlight.

Speaking of feeding things, what about dinner?

Again???

What's the temperature now?

Some people can read 'War and Peace' and come away thinking it was a simple adventure story. Other people can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and come away with the secret of the universe.  Y'know.

Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.

You've been under such a strain. And I've ...I've --  -- neglected you. Mea culpa! Y'know.

I don't understand.

This all has something to do with Superman, doesn't it?

I have sworn to uphold the laws of Krypton.

Boy!

Need I ask who's favored to collect at the end of this week.

I was thinkin' what to call him. I was thinkin' I had an uncle who was a fine man, you recall him? The Church Sexton

Got all A's this year. Teacher said he's the best 5th grader in the -

Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.

Yes, true. But on other worlds there would be other problems - heat, cold, no life, no life support systems...No, Lara, believe me; Earth is the least of evils. On Earth, his lighter gravity will render him almost weightless - that can't be helped. But with his denser molecular structure, he will also be strong.  He will be fast, He will be virtually invulnerable.

Lois, take Kent there and introduce him around

Lois, the kickback story...

If one of you can get that  -- I mean, I want the real Superman. Who is he? Where's he from? What's his favorite ball team? What's up?

This is incredible. I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean, you don't have an answering service, right?

If I do, you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.

Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.

How old are you?

How much do you weigh?

Where do you hail from?

I gave him this new face.

Is that real enough for you?

Yes, we do know each other.  I'm Alison Jones.

We're...not together.

I'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay.

Then...when did she get better?

Alison.

I hope she gets better.

My name is...

I can help you.

Hi, Nicole.

So what brings you out tonight?

Because it's what we have to do.

She said she's got to be home by nine.

Does this mean I can't take a shower?

What time's he coming home?

What are you thinking?

Yes.

They can look forward to that.

I mean, the way they look.  Their hair and clothing...

From what?

No, nothing like that.  Billy's wife, Lydia, died of cancer a few years ago.  He took over raising the children by himself.  It was obvious how much he missed Lydia.

You've talked to Billy?

And Billy told you that he'll tell that to...

You heard what Abbott said?

It's for the school bazaar.

We've only got honey.

He thought it was cute when I called him Frankenstein.  It wasn't.  I feel like his monster.

Maybe we shouldn't be talking about this just now, with you barely home. Aren't you hungry, honey?  Want me to fix you something?

Hey, Billy!  What brings you out on a night like this?  C'mon in.  Take a load off.

It's like a song.

Nicole?

No.  Not mean.  Just...very angry.

I don't like thinking about the accident.  I don't even remember it happening.  Besides, it just makes people feel sorry for me, and...

You can only feel lucky that you didn't die for so long.  Then you start to feel...unlucky.

It would be strange if you didn't feel that way.

They work for the people we're trying to sue.  Their job is to try to minimize damages.  Our job, Nicole, is to try to maximize them. You have to think of it that way. As people doing their jobs.  No good guys or bad guys.  Just our side and their side.

Why?

Do you have a room?

When?

That's the local bar?

That's great, Wendell.  That's the sort of thing I need to know.  So it doesn't come back to haunt our case later on.

I'm in a car wash.

DADDY!!!

Why can't you talk to me?

Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.

I'm sorry about that, Mr. Stephens. Would you like to try the fish?

I'm sorry for coming over unannounced like this, Mrs. Otto, but the Walkers said you would understand.  I know it's an awful time, but it's important that we talk.

I'm a lawyer.

The Walkers spoke very highly of you.

Dolores?

Yes.

You are?

I will offer that report.  Well, then, now that your memory seems to be clearing, can you tell us what else  you observed at that time?

I was scared.

Why were you scared?

How fast would you say Mrs. Driscoll was going?  To the best of your recollection?

You believe that the bus driven by Mrs. Driscoll was going at seventy- two miles an hour at this time?

Why not?

You remember this?

What do you remember about the accident?

Of course.

What took so long?

Partly.  But there's a lot the insurance doesn't cover.  That's one of the reasons we have a lawyer.  To make sure the insurance gets paid and to help us look after the rest.

Are you sleeping?

Well, there's the Hamiltons.  Joe and Shelly Hamilton.

Loretta...Sidney Falco...

That's right!  Tell him, so I can read it in Hunsecker's column first!

But of course...

Hello, Sidney.  Wanna table?

Boys, this gets nobody nowhere - you're over excited, Steve and -

That's a lollipop that, boy.  The kid is only great.

Thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow.

Frank, I think maybe you lied to me.

You told him that?

Listen, Frank, you'd better make sure you're telling me the truth.

Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear.  You have my sincere word...

May I lift my eyebrows?  What is this?  What are you trying to do?

And what have I done to her, besides not buy her a new fur coat lately?  Sidney, you were right -- the boy's a dilly.

But my day with Susie isn't over yet and--

What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...

Why are you trembling, dear...?

You know, dear, we're drifting apart, you and I, and I don't like that.

No!  NO!  Don't touch me!

Hello, Harry.

Can I come out?  No.

Spahish...that must show he likes "spigs", too.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...

Correct me if I'm wrong - WE! Because when I'm out on this very slippery limb for you, you have to know what's involved.

I know Steve.  No.

Well, what have I got?  Alimony to a pair of tramps?  They're of no concern to me.  It's you who count, but don't get me wrong - I don't intend to let you break your neck again!

What are you so chipper about?  If I put a cross on every one of your mistakes, you'd look like a graveyard!

Are you listening?

Sidney, I told you -

It's nice, Sidney, that you give me this tip...

Well, I'll be darned.  And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?

I thought he would.

What's your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates?

Don't you know who that man is?

That's the third time he's called today.

No, an arm, he said.  I told him you were sure the item would be in Mr. Hunsecker's column in tomorrow's...

I wish I could help in some way, Sidney.

You mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world???

You ought to be used to me by now.

What's the matter?

I swear, Sidney, I can't help it - sometimes I wonder what I see in you...

Frank, you don't listen!  J.J. just told you to shut your mouth!

Give him credit---the boy's gall is gorgeous!

Feels like a Monday night, don't it...?

We stick in each others craw.

It's not my nature, Susie, but I'll talk to you like an uncle...

Listen, get a good night's sleep - tomorrow's another day.  Feeling sorry for yourself won't help.

And I'm sorry for you, too, Sidney. You're going down with the ship.

Don't run away - I was always the man for you!  I'm talking to you out of two years of silence - listen to what I say!  Inside of six months -

Jimmy, I'm on my way inside right now to talk to Hunsecker.  I can promise you -

Listen, when your band was playing at Roseland -

Steve...what you tried to do today...you tried to take me up on a high mountain...I couldn't go all the way...I failed you...  Will you forgive me?  Have I lost you, Steve?  Have I...?

... but the output went to shit after three seconds.  I'm thinking now it's the way I'm matrixing the command hierarchies...

Baby, this thing is going to blow 'em all away. It's a neural-net process --

They told us not to ask where they got it.  I thought... Japan... hell, I don't know.  I didn't want to know.

So this other guy?  He's a terminator too, right, like you?

Where we going?

We spent a lot of time in Nicaragua... places like that.  For a while she was with this crazy ex-Green Beret guy, running guns.  Then there were some other guys.  She'd shack up with anybody she could learn from.  So then she could teach me how to be this great military leader.  Then she gets busted and it's like... sorry kid, your mom's a psycho.  Didn't you know?  It's like... everything I'd been brought up to believe was just made-up fantasy, right? I hated her for that.  But everything she said was true.  We gotta get her out of there.

Oww!  Why'd you do that?

Does it hurt?

Excellent.

Torque wrench please.

I'll deal with the police.

Is it dead?

It, John.  Not him.  It.

It's okay.  It'll by okay.  We'll figure it out.

I know.  This is a dream, Sarah.

I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be.  I can't do it.  I'm screwing up the mission.

So what do you think, Doctor?  I've shown a lot of improvement, haven't I?

Can it be destroyed?

You look like handmade shit.

Yes.  It launches its ICBMs against their targets in Russia.

The CPU from the first terminator.

It's finally over.

Are you afraid?

Don't see me to my door, there's no need.

When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased?

'Please remember that Dr. Furtwängler risked his life to help anyone who asked him. I personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help. He never turned anyone away. After he heard me play... I am a violinist... he gave me money because I was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to Sweden. He helped countless people in similar ways.'

So, what does the Russki want?

What the hell are they doing?

So what is it?

What?

Hello, Major, my name is Dymshitz. I'm glad to see you.

And suddenly, Steve, suddenly you notice that they like you. They honour you, suddenly you are the director of the best museum in the world, for example.

I'm sorry. Museum? Not... I said orchestra. Sorry. Believe me.  Help me, Steve. You say you answer for someone from high up. I, too, have orders from high up. Very high up. We want Furtwängler. I'll give you in return the whole orchestra, four, five conductors. I need him, Steve.

I'm sorry.

Of course.

I have been questioned by the Gestapo just like that. Just like you questioned him.

What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit. Okay? I have your questionnaire here,  Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtwängler, born Berlin, January 1886. Orchestral conductor. And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party.

That sounds like the small print in one of our insurance policies, Wilhelm. And what about April 19, 1942?  The eve of Hitler's fifty- third birthday, the big celebration; you conducted for Hitler, didn't you? Was that in keeping with your view that art and politics have nothing to do with each other?

I made no deal!

Did you call someone you knew?

I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended?

Why were they going to arrest you?

You sure knew a lot of people in high places.

You were real close to all of them, to Adolf, to Hermann, to Joseph, to Baldur, and now Albert,  So, let's hear the truth, let's come clean. What was your Party number?

I believe art and politics should be separate, but that they weren't kept separate I learned to my cost.

I have no idea what you're talking about.

We never, never officially represented the regime when we played abroad. We always performed as a private ensemble. As I think I already told you, I was a freelance conductor.

That's an outrageous lie!

Please stop playing these games with me. Why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding.

Stop this, please, stop this now!

Okay, so what is it?

Good, and according to your questionnaire, Helmuth, you never joined the Nazi Party.

The only thing I know is he's an anti-Semite.

Furtwängler sent Hitler a telegram for his birthday.

Yes. A corporal. US Army. A Jew. He said he'd seen the telegram in the Chancellery.

But I need documentary proof. You know of anything like that?

Edwin von der Null. Music critic. He gave Furtwängler terrible reviews while he raved about Herbert von Karajan.

Goebbels, yes, Josef Goebbels said, 'There's not a single filthy Jew left in Germany on whose behalf Dr. Furtwängler has not intervened.' No, no one could have been less of a Nazi than Dr. Furtwängler.

He's as big as Toscanini, maybe even bigger. In this neck of the woods, he's probably Bob Hope and Betty Grable rolled into one.

No, I was never a Nazi, I have no interest in politics, I'm a musician -

Yes, that's true, but he refused to give the Nazi salute. He kept his baton in his right hand. In Hitler's presence. That was a brave act...

Mmm.  Same schedule's okay.

Anything else?

What do you think?

Alright, the beige one.

That bum.  So what if he has a Porsche, he can't treat you like that...it's Friday night for crissakes.

Compared to me she is.  How come you're not at the cash anymore?  They catch ya steal- ing?

We gotta get you to a doctor.

You volunteered?

Bag some Z's?

Reese.  Think it through. We can prevent the war. Nobody else is gonna do it. If we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again.  We have to so it ourselves.

He'll find us, won't he?

And so you feel nothing.

I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said...

What are you doing?

I don't think I like this.

...it had no choice. The defensive grid was smashed. We'd taken the mainframes... We'd won.  Taking out Connor then would make no difference.  Skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence.  We captured the lab complex.  Found the...what- ever it was called...the time-displacement equipment. The Terminator had already gone through.  They sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. Sumner didn't make it.

You go naked.  Something about the field generated by a living organism.  Nothing dead will go.

You've heard enough.  Decide. Are you going to release me?

I can help you...

...look, Lieutenant...uh, Vukovich, don't put me on hold and don't transfer me to another department...

Why don't you just stretch out here and get some sleep.  It'll take your mom a good hour to get here from Redlands.

That stuff's two hours cold.

My stock's falling.  Isn't yours? Those pennies are costing me millions.

It is so very inappropriate for you to mention my father.  Or, did you think this, between us, was friendship?  Just because you went fishing with my father, I should sit on my hands while you throw my money away?

Clean out your locker.

I want to know what's going on.  Are you part of this?

The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...

I'm sorry, about this...

There's got to be a flashlight.

Read what it says: "Warning, do <u>not</u> attempt to open.  If elevator stops, use emergency... "

It's much easier this way.  Come on, step up...

Please...

Goodnight.

The maitre d' called you Christine.

What are you doing here?

Didn't think I'd ever see you again.

Do you mind if I sit?

I'm tired.  I'm sorry, I should go. I've been enough of a nuisance.

Take the picture out.

Then, what good are you?

Nicholas, this is fake.  It's all part of the game...

No, now wait... think about it.  What did you see... ?

What did you <u>really see</u>?  This whole time... special effects, squibs, like in the movies.  Please, you've got to believe me...  He's got a gun, with real bullets!

Open that door, you'll see.  Your brother's there... Conrad.  He's there.  It's your birthday party...

Hi.  Didn't get a chance to say goodbye.

Like what... my favorite color... ?

Originally, Connecticut.

One brother, one sister.

You look good.

About me?

Really?

You've heard of it.  You've seen other people having it.  They're an entertainment service, but more than that.

Tell me you'll call.

Will you?

Tell me where we're going.

What are you doing?

Yeah, almost...

You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!

Because you hate me.  Because you had to be here, when mom died.  Because you had to do it alone.  Well, don't you think if I'd known... I'd've been here too.  I'd have been here...

You know... how'd you manage the gun? I mean...

Split it?

Yes.

I need your car, Elizabeth.

I don't write the questions.  I just review them.

We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...

How long will these take?

Physical?

One guarantee.  Payment's entirely at your brother's discretion and, as a gift, dependent on your satisfaction.

Drive in.

I need the police.

Mr. Van Orton... ?

All the time I've known you, you've never once asked about him.

Your mother thought he was a good man.  He worked very hard.  What I remember most was his manner was so... slight.  It was easy to spend time in a room, and not realize he'd been there the whole time.

No.  What happened... no one expected it.

What's this about?

He couldn't, or refused to pay.  We extended credit...

The Fitzwilliam Botanical Garden Annual Fundraiser.

What gentleman, Maria?

I wasn't expecting you.

How concerned should I be?

And what kind of sleeper?

I only saw Theo drive up.

Couldn't get the last ones.  You?

So could you!  Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?

That depends on your definition of ghosts.  I'm going to check on her, and then I'm going to stay awake.

You used the wrong test.

Nell --

Was sure she'd be in here.

Are you working with her?

Why are you working with her? Mary Lambretta was thrown out of the department for trying to get a Ph.D. in psychic studies.

You wrote that you had trouble sleeping.

All the carvings.

Let's say it wasn't you.  Who did it?

What is that tune?

Nell... please, Nell... take a deep breath...

No.

What's this?  What's this... this picture?

Is she asleep?

He's wandering around the house, and Nell heard him.  She thought it was ghosts.  Let's go look for him again.

Oh God, we can't get out!

What did it cost?

Jeez.

Theo... Did you?

Why?

I'm sorry I was mad at you, Theo.

Are you sure?

This is real, I'm not making it up!  Theo, you saw it!  You were there -- the banging and last night.  You, you all saw the painting!

I'm not.

As soon as you get dressed.

I'm not into finger foods.  Too fussy.

What's the matter?

No.

Hey.

See, a successful man like me has limitations -- I lose touch at a street level.  So I have to depend on a smart boy like you who's closer to the nitty and the gritty than I am.

Fuck you.

Man knows what he likes.

What, tryin' to catch him with another bird?

Are you a resident of California? You gonna fill out forms, man?  Do the background check?  Go through a three-day waiting period?

You hadda show up on a weekend.  This weekend.  Wouldn't've even been a gun show ... for another month.

Now what.  You gonna take your new arsenal, go visit Terry Valentine, just like that?  Boom bam boom.

Five years, I think.  Long time.

Told you you wouldn't be able to see through that gate.

What?

What's so fucking funny?

What are we standing on?

Bring the motor around.  Bang out in front, right?

Steady on.

I've been wondering something.

Do you have any friends, man?

Not no more, they ain't.  I quit that acting shit, man.

... Reminds me of Jennifer.

Why did you come here?

In any case, I don't suppose the salary you make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline travel.

And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out.  From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?  Pink Floyd concert receipts.  Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?

Ashamed.

When did you get in?

You haven't been lurking outside my building all day.

I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.

I bet.

In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren?

So what's the deal.  You and Terry Valentine at twenty paces.  Is that what this is about.

You fuckin' guys and your dicks.

On what.  What makes you so certain.

You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess.

Overnight.  What about just now?

You <u>have</u> been away.  Or is all this just new to you?

Not that I recall.

Minor officials bother you, don't they?

She used to tell me she'd turn me in.  Little kid.  Ten year old.  "If you're naughty, Dad, I'll tell on ya."  She didn't want me sent down again, see. When I was planning some job.  "I'll tell 'em, Dad, I promise I will.  Here, look, I'm calling the Old Bill right now" -- picking up the telephone.  I can see her, the phone in her hand.  Became a sort of joke between us.  Only it wasn't a joke.

Friends and <u>colleagues</u>.

You're just on a higher plane, Wilson.

So what's your beef, pal?

Valentine had himself a party, I hear.

You sure?

Turned that place completely around.  180 degrees.

Out on a oil rig.  In the North Sea. Nine years.

Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth.

We coulda used the other two-and-a-half grand.

Like what.

Hello there.

Surely you can think of somewhere else to take one of your chippies for a quick getaway.

You must know Ian.

She could've had the deal!  I would've handed it to her if she wanted.  I would have given her everything.

Ann--

Hello, Rachel.

Oh, in there? I messed up a little bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr Crane.

You've got talent, anyone could see that. And he's the best. If he thinks a student has talent, he'll take 'em on for next to nothing. You're a cinch to be accepted, I could cover the cost of the lessons, like I said, it's pretty modest--

I have to do it. I can't stand by and watch more things go down the drain. You're young, you don't understand.

...I stank, didn't I?

I do appreciate the interest you've taken, though.

You're an enthusiast.

...I guess I've been all wet.

...No, please.

...You are ze fahzer?

...Mm.

Mistake, no, it says E-flat, she plays E-flat. Ping-ping. Hit the right note, always. Very proper.

I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.

...it just goes to show, when one door slams shut, another one opens. Here's to ya, uh...

Right! Strictly business.

...Usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft. But cash--that's fine--it's all the same in the end-- dough's dough, huh?

...Just a second here, I'll give you a receipt on the, uh... Whoa, Nellie... Oh, by the way, we didn't talk about this, I, uh, I think I'm gonna call the place Tolliver's, after me, you know, I didn't think you were much interested in, uh--

...Were you in the service, Ed?

...Oh, Jesus.

...Doesn't become a matter of public record unless there's foul play. However. I don't believe I'm *prohibited* from telling you this. I guess I'm not obliged to tell you, either. I don't exactly know.  But if *I* were the man, I'd want to be told.

I don't know what's going on. I--

I know all about that. But I don't know how much to tell them.

...Did Big Dave mention that it was something about his war service? I don't know, I wasn't there, *you'll* have to tell *us*. Maybe he specified, maybe he didn't; I'm not putting words in your mouth; the point is that this liar, this cynical manipulator, this man who through his lies sneered and belittled the sacrifice and heroism of all our boys who *did* serve and bleed and puke and die on foreign shores, and who made a fool out of this entire town, turns to *you* to help him out of his jam. Fat-assed sonofabitch!

...how I was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the D.A. made me out to be, how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel, and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn't had a chance to trot out for Doris...

...and inflame the passions of these twelve fine men and women...

Thanks. Thanks for seeing me, at home.

No thanks.

Yeah. What do I, uh...

Bert's OK, sure, he's a good man. I won't kid you though, Ed, nobody around here has any experience with this kind of, er... And I hear they're bringing a prosecutor up from Sacramento. Capital offense. Taking it seriously... Hmm...

Taking it seriously.

...Huh?

That was quite something.

Says here that the Russians exploded n A-bomb and there's not a damn thing we can do about it.

The point is there's a certain art to the process. The point is not merely to provide, and let me point out, these fish are not as dumb as you might think.

...I'm gonna take his hair and throw it out in the dirt.

I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together!

I don't understand.

Oh, happy days! I wish I was doing well enough to turn away business! More power to ya, brother! The public be damned!

No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.

...Yeah, it's a tough break.

His eyes are open.

Manual overrides aren't working.  I'm getting nothing, Lieutenant.

Sweet Jesus!

This huge police presence tonight isn't necessary, Lieutenant.  You'll just scare people off.  I can handle the security behind scenes with this system.  It's state of the art.

In every exhibition room.  The museum's divided into five cells. The reception and exhibit are in cell five.  We could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four, then seal the perimeter with our fire doors.

The whole system is shutting down! We have to get out quickly before the fire doors fall!

I told you!  They seal off all the cells.  They were designed to fall automatically in a system failure --

I made it outside.  I'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here.  Help is on the way.  Just sit tight.

An original Roger Tory Peterson of a Red-Breasted Merganser.  Amazing.  I have a copy of this in my office at home.

In this violent world, I believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things.

Did you read about a boat that washed up outside of New Orleans about four months ago?  Twelve bodies on board.

Yes.  That's my case.  Now it's yours. All the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way. Decapitated.  Brains extracted.  Limbs torn to shreds.  It looked like the work of a large animal, but there was no sign of an animal on board.

You think what we've got here is a monster as big as a house that smells... like hamburger?

I smell it.  It's here.

It's still back there!

All right.  Kawakita, cover the rear.

Please.  Don't humiliate me further.

No, Margo.  This is one problem you can't solve.  You have to stay out of it.  The fact is, I want to retire.

Come on.  I'll walk you back to the elevator.

This isn't a death sentence.  Greg has promised to teach me fly fishing.  I'll garden.  I'll write.

Something tried to get into this room!

Quiet!

They've got something.

Shut them up!

Jesus, what is this?

For once I'm glad you're rumor central.  What in the world is going on?

Turkish Gecko, I believe.  A lizard.

These plant fibers are loaded with hormones!

Pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victim's brains!

Got to finish this thesis sometime.

Yes.  Once.  We met at Columbia.  John held the Cadwalader Chair in Statistical Paleontology when I was a grad student there.

I don't understand.

What happened?

That's not what I saw.

What was it?

Pendergast?  Are you all right?

We have to try and draw it off!

Just like John.  He won't listen.

I'm sorry.  I don't have anything for at least a month.

You want to book the flight?

What happened down there?

I'm sure we'll get him on this next sweep.

We're not watching the sea.

He doesn't care.

Welcome.

How <i>do</i> you intend to explain his twenty- two year absence?

We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort.  Haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep?

Are we talking Emmies?

I have a map.

Sure she would.

Lauren, right?

Right now?  We've got finals tomorrow.

Truman, you know, I did think about moving away one time.

You really think it could've dropped off an airliner?

I think it's got something to do with my dad.

It's hard to tell.  They look just like regular people.

That's the "Big Guy".  Quite a paintbrush he's got.

...personally I think the unconquered south face is the only one worth scaling...of course it's a 20,000 foot sheer wall of ice but then when did that ever stop me before?...Naturally, I intend to make the ascent without the benefit of oxygen but also without crampons or even an ice pick...<i>risks?</i>...  ...sure I'm aware of the risks--why else do you think I would spend seven years as an adjuster in a life insurance company...?

Hi, honey.  Look at this.  It's a "Chef's-Mate."  Dicer, slicer and peeler in one.  Never needs sharpening. Dishwasher safe.

Come on, Truman.  Haven't you studied enough?

--you're a nurse, aren't you?

It's hard to go places, isn't it?

Why don't I make you some of this new Mococoa Drink?  All natural.  Cocoa beans from the upper slopes of Mount Nicaragua. No artificial sweeteners--

Stop this now.  I'll do it.  I swear.

You look very pale, Truman.  Are you taking your vitamin D's?

It looks so small.

Well, thank you for your help.

They're coming.  Any minute.

Just listen.  You remember when you were a little boy, you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like Magellan--

Well, we're FBI agents.

And you have conclusive evidence of this? Something to tie this claim of yours to the crime --

Have you examined them?

You said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found.

My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil.

You a reporter?

Those people were already dead.

Michaud was a twenty-two year veteran of the bureau --

What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states.

And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that.  What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas?

I'll know soon enough.

Negotiating with whom?

And they tell me I'm paranoid.

I'm on the roof.

Scully, get somebody to open this door.

Scully?

They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.

You're... quitting?

Are you drunk, Mulder?

It's like jelly.

You knew this man didn't die at the bomb site before we got here.

Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too.

How was it contracted?

And you've never seen anything like that?

This looks like new grass to you?

And where are they going with it?

Where would they be going?

What?

That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.

Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?

Scully....?

I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because I knew --

What? What happened?

Cold...

Why don't you go on ahead head and I'll confirm authorization.

You don't see what's going on here, do you?  There's four hundred million dollars in damage to the city of Dallas. Lives have been lost. No suspects have been named. So the story being shaped is this could have been prevented. That the FBI didn't do its job.

I know.  Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas.

Are we being watched?

What are you doing?

Mr. Mulder.

This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?

Until Dallas, we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism. That mass infection would make us a slave race.

But... he sacrificed his own daughter. My sister, Samantha.

Why are you telling me this?

Where is he?

Let me out. Stop the car.

You have precious little time. What I've given you the alien colonists have no idea exists. You hold in your hand the power to end the project.

My god...

We're going to tell them what we've found. What we've learned. Turn over a body infected with the gestating organism.

I do it all the time!

You're sure?  Any more nightmares?

Good.  We need you healthy and relaxed. You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television.

Nothing.

The first... What?  Six or seven times I went in.   Remember what happened?

Is it cold in here?

This man is deeply disturbed, he...

This is Stargher we're talking about?

Whoa.  Hold on.  Aren't they the same guy?

Remember, Julia Hickson is priority number one.  Nothing else matters.  Find out where she is.

You sure about this?

I heard Julia and John got married.

He also says that until proven differently, Julia Hickson was found as a result of good old-fashioned detective work.

What now?

Who says?

Yep.  And guess who they hired to seal up the place?

Not a gift.  A highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex, that's all.  A genetic fluke.

How's the patient.

So?

Jesus Christ, man, you look like hell.

You're bettin' the farm on something you saw after they pumped you full of god knows-what kind of shit?

Den leuten.

I don't know. They didn't answer.

You shouldn't get mixed up in this.

Might as well I suppose. Are you busy?

Gestern bein heurigen...

...to steal my girl.

What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?

Let's not get into any more trouble.

He liked to laugh.

...again.

Here, it will be cold on that train.

What is going to happen? Where is Harry?

...quarrel?

Must you take those letters? CALLOWAY Yes, I'm afraid so.

You know as much as I do, Miss Schmidt - you were intimate with Lime, weren't you?

Miss Schmidt, we know he is somewhere across the canal in the Russian sector... You may as well help us. In a few minutes Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you about your papers. Tell me where Lime is.

They are - private - letters.

We are interested in this case. Have you arrested the girl?

See much of him before that?

Must have known I was broke. Even sent me an airplane ticket. It's a shame.

Why don't you catch a few murderers for a change?

What the devil?

Do you see what that means?

...be responsible for you in the streets.

Fifty yards right down there.

A girl of spirit.

I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...

Win what?

Calloway, can't you do something about Anna?

Wait a minute - let me out.

Be sensible, Martins.

Very good, sir.

Shall I go over there, sir?

Do you know his number?

Welcome?

They wouldn't know me.

Zane Grey.

The author. Thought you might be interested.

Listen, Harry - I didn't believe that...

Hmm.

Unwise, Holly...

It's far better thing that I do... Holly, you and I aren't heroes, the world doesn't make any heroes...

...this way.

...were of you.

...you know and all that.

Are you mad?

Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.

Speak English?

Already gone.

Coffin?

Did you know Mr. Lime well?

Happened...Yes happened right down there.

Oh, er - oh...was he - was he still alive?

...give evidence.

Yes, it is.

I thought there was something funny about the whole thing.

Third Man.

...this time.

Should I make it all fact?

...Mr. Martins?

If you could see your way to lending me some cash -

Yea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise.

Bonjour.

It would be nice though, if there was a place like that. You know, that no one could get to.

It's arranged. Tomorrow morning. Eight hundred bath.

He will not take us to the island. It's in the National Park and it is forbidden to go there. But we are allowed to travel to this one to stay for one night.

I don't know - I'm American.

Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.

She just went under the water. She was pulled under. Oh God, I don't see her.

He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach.

You think?! Based on what?

No one follows that midrash.

What's a fascist?

They're racist, they're militaristic, they act like bullyboys in the territories....

...So she takes the pants in back -- where they try them on? And I think fuck it....

It's called the flame alphabet. It's supposed to be the word of God written in fire.

Fuck you. I hate the Jews at least as much as you do.

Yeah, but not on the letters.

Where'd you read all that stuff?

Is he a Nazi?

You think people ever commit suicide out of happiness?

You're not like the others, are you?... Your friends.

Too many good players down here. I'm with one right now.

I'm coming to your room tonight.

Do you know it like that? By heart.

Put something on. You're not supposed to be naked in front of it.

See, the Jews love to separate things: the holy from the profane, milk from meat, wool from linen, the Sabbath from the week, the Jew from the gentile.... As if one little scrap of this was going to completely contaminate that.

Christianity's silly, but at least there's something to believe in. Or not believe. Judaism there's nothing.

The real Nazis. Hitler, Goebbels, they talked about Jews incessantly.... You ever read their diaries?...

You want a punch in the mouth?

You can't. Do you know how many people I've brought into...the movement...?

Why are you taking that?

More cultural than political.

That would be a catastrophic mistake.

It helps me concentrate.... So does that mean you're a white supremacist?

Yes. It's very pleasurable. But the Jews are obsessed with it. You know why?

Let's just say I've done due diligence.

Those aren't Jews.

Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he "universalizes" everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. This is his strength....  Take the great Jewish minds: Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of Europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. Why? Because it is the deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end...

What? Excuse me?...  You're kidding, right?

Why did you come tonight? To see me?

How did you get the fucking number?

Don't tell me what I --

Lina Moebius. And you are...?

Without blood -- a willingness to spill it -- there's no real power, no authority.

We're already marginal. We are saying what no one else has the guts to say. Isn't that precisely our appeal?

Do you feel you're making progress here?

How have things been going?

Hello...?

Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?

Which one were you aiming at?

Shut up. Fuck you....

They don't. I checked twenty times.... Somebody must have talked.

I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS...

Lie on your stomach and come up on your elbows.

Where do you think you're going?

...You're saying that when he first appeared at your house, you had no idea he was Jewish....

He's shy, not like Enzo.

I think, he's really nice... He's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.

Maybe you should talk to him about it.

Did the driver really freeze?

Yes.  Of course.  Very wise.

He seems to have won it.

I tell you she's mine!

A new world record!  That's great! It gives me something to beat tomorrow!  You ever been to Tahiti?

You forgot the Hula!

Little.  Very little.  And skinny, very skinny too.  That is compared to me.

Huh?  Well listen to him!  Do you hear that?

Tonight we're having a little party among ourselves.  8 o'clock in my suite?

... It's a comfortable place.

Because you'd laugh.

How do you know that?

... Not yet.

Yes?

Enzo, wake up!

Plenty of women everywhere right?

... What's your name again?

Is that alcohol?  Are you out of your mind?  Alcohol is strictly forbidden.

You don't mind if I go instead, do you?

I don't want to be in any competition... I dive because I like to, not to beat a record... don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him?

You're the best, Enzo!

I remember.  Hi Roberto!

It's okay, Enzo.  I'll go somewhere else.

... So, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask.  Am I right?

That's good.

It's okay.

No, no!

... I was seventeen, I loved her so much I tried to die for her. Two years later I couldn't even remember her name!  Let me tell you, time erases everything!

Anybody can have a bad day!

I'm concentrating.

Thanks for helping with the bag.  It looks great!

You jumped in?

She's not like the others.  She can't stand to be away from the sea.

Jacques, you set a world record.

Hello?

How are you?

I'm being a pain, huh?

Why did you take me to the hotel, if you live here.

Bonjour Monsieur... Louis. 

What?

What's wrong?

Why?

You've got to tell me what happened?

Why don't you ask me?

Uncle Louis!

In my apartment?

It's his heartbeat.

... Since eight o'clock last night...!  You're in love.

What is it honey... the frenchy?

If there was a problem, they could do something right?

... And those?

My dear, science is a cruel mistress.

It was a trap. I'm back at square one.

Good thinking. We'll disguise ourselves as a Gentile couple to pass undetected. Now that he thinks I'm dead, this should be a piece of homentashen.

Mordechai. Thank god you're here.

So. Do you have a name?

Well, for starters, we're going to honeymoon in Boca for a week. And then, when we get back, Morty's been talking about taking a stable, good paying job as a consultant for the JDL.

From the way she carried herself I could tell she'd been around the block a few times...

How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on?

Any sign of Santa?

That got annoying fairly quickly.

Esther!

Esther!

...and the opportunity to help my brothers and sisters in the Jewish community.

Hello Mazel Tov! A boojee boojee boojee boo...

Happy Hanukkah Tikva.

Actually, I...I don't. What does that mean?

What's wrong with him?

Cool. What's it do?

So, what's our first plan of attack Santa?

I wasn't too over the top?

You okay?

Get off of me you cripple!

What's going on? Why'd he stop?

What day is it?

Here is something that should interest Charlie - a stone leopard head made by his ancestors some six hundred years ago. They used it in ceremonies. The jaguar -- in fact all the cat family -- were considered the personification of force and violence in their religious rites.

Where's that man?

And here is Three Tree Mesa -- and here I go out of the big arroyo --

) They buried Teresa today and they were hunting the leopard again -- out in the country this time. But they didn't get him.

You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.

Cut.

Something black - something on its way to you 

Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed - He'll come up with something.

Why not? He's a good press agent and a good friend. Besides, we've shared a lot of headaches 

And if you've got cold feet honey, Ill take over for you. That red dress of yours fits just perfect on me.

You know all about these things - - and I've lived here all my life - and I still don't know what the Procession means.

Show business?

Well, I'd best be off.

Doc -- something you said the other day --

Why?

But it doesn't eat what it kills.

Just a minute, Robles.  Let him go on.

You know Charlie How-Come?

You must admit it's possible that it might have been a man.

Then you found the leopard --

That was unfortunate.

I've disturbed	you. I'm sorry -

I haven't done any posse work since last time I rode with Toni Mix at the old Bijou Theatre -- aged six, If you're interested,

Yes. The lipstick.

Chief, don't you understand what this means?

That's a fact, isn't it?

Makes no difference. Get him out!

You're too good to me.

On his back, I suppose.

You're too good to me.

Why do you want to stay around here? It'll only make you feel badly.

Kiki -- it wasn't the leopard.

All right, I'm not ashamed of it! I split it two ways 

Nobody? Huh!... How come?

That might depend on where youre going.

Mrs De Moraes must have taken it hard, eh?  Her brothers death.

What about you, Mrs De Moraes?

How dare you...  You dont know this tape belongs to my brother, do you, Mr Lombard?

Get out of my house. Youre fired, Mr Lombard.

Who is Friedman?

Im impressed. That information could have cost me £20,000.

Mr Lombard?

Just a moment...  Go ahead.

Black suits you.

Or is it the other way round? The children are needed because you cant satisfy him?

How did you break into my office, Deborah? Ladies of your standing dont learn to pick locks between shopping trips.  Come on, Deborah! Acting dumb doesnt suit you! Who knew Id found dirt on your brother, huh? Who knew it was in an envelope? Taking me for dead, whod want to make sure it didnt fall into the wrong hands?

Tell me, did he kill his little victims too?

Adonis thought your brothers bodyd be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didnt he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...

Kids are not your thing, Deborah. Youd have been ready for me when I turned up with Sleeping Beauty. Damn it! Then too I should have paid more attention. Not Leon, you said. It struck me at the time, but obviously not hard enough. You didnt say My God!, or whatever else well-bred ladies squeak on hearing Uncle Henry misbehaved. Not Leon. Who then?  You sure were right about one thing, Deborah, the job was too formidable for me. I should have thought a little more before I left for Los Angeles. But there I was focused so hard on Friedman Id stopped thinking. Nothing added up - Leon soliciting money for prints while buying kids at £15,000 a go; infiltrating the world of child traffickers; duping Friedman into selling him a little boy... You sure were right. The job was too formidable for me. But you knew that, didnt you?

Why did you send me after Friedman? To atone for your sins?

Rich. Young. Beautiful. You must at least get a kick out of what he does to his kids.

What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child suppliers being tailed?

Something like that?

What happened? Adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice?

I... We have to bury Leon tommorrow...

Directory enquiries. Can I help you?

Good morning, sir. How can I help you?

Is this some kind of sick stunt? Let me guess.  You want money, right?

No answer. You have no passport and your Embassys out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?

Its give and take time, Mr Lombard. You need help, we need information. You didnt really expect me to put my ass on the line helping a criminal just for the thrill of it, did you?

...Im Emily Stewart. The hysterical female who sees evil everywhere since the day her thirteen year-old boy disappeared. The pain in the ass who cries wolf at the drop of a hat. However I go about this thats who I am. Do you get what Im fucking saying, Mr Lombard?

Hi...

Weve still got the Italian...

Im calling about the puppies.

Pups. Bitches. From three to twelve months.  Trained and untrained ones. White and brown ones. You understand?

We also provide 24-hour after-sale service. Were the puppy to fall sick or accidently die, we would unburden you, you understand?

Who are you?

I dont know. Hes gone!  Hes gone. I dont fucking know where, I swear... Hes gone. On holiday...

Where are we?

And who does Friedman work for?

How many of you scumbags are here?

The Hyatt. Good afternoon. May I help you?

Next time he calls tell Mr Gluck he better be there to take his calls at 9 tonight or at 9 in the morning if he cares about his puppies. Got that?

Fine. How was the match? Did you loose?

Must be your lucky day then. Ive got your accounts - you dont owe much tax for last year.

Have you heard of a French film called La Collectionoose?

La collectionoose. Its about a young girl in the south of France who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her. Its on TV tonight and as Im in I thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and... The review says its about the conflict between intellect and instinct. And witty. The directors supposed to be famous. Rommel or something. French. You must know him?

Oh... We split up.

Ive got work tonight, Jane.

Shes pretty... See you, huh?

Id appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you cant, dont worry about it. Ill call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but Im in a hurry. 

May I...?

You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.

Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?

What do you think has happened to your son, Mrs Spitz?

How did you do that, Mrs Spitz?

So he could have decided to go on a trip...

We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention.

Youre out of your mind. Whats the idea?

Is this Friedman, Martin?  Come on, scumbag. Youve reached your sell- by date. Tell me if this is Friedman, where he is in Los Angeles and what name hes using?

You seem very sure about that.

Its about the puppy. You got the money?

I gather weve done business with a friend of yours?

Your lady friend did.

Will you be alone?  The merchandise. Is it just you or...

Im sorry...

Its wet. Will this do?

He just said he had good reasons.

Who else knows about the boy?

No sick people in the country, huh?... Just tell me one thing, Rhian. Leons story about the boy? You just took his word for it?

Huh... I guess you aint quite ready for civilisation yet... Ill give you one more day, a meal, and then youre on your way.

Huh! You could always try Suicide Bridge.  You dont know Leon, do you?

Yeah! Somewhere in Wales. I dont really know her. Used to turn up in a Transit van on weekends, sell old furniture at Camden. Thats how come he only laid her at weekends, ha ha...

Jai bien peur quil te faudra attendre.  Pas avant la matinée.

Alors?

We are so alike, Xavier. Still, sometimes I wonder which one of us is the ugliest.

Five seconds. Then you die.

Why did you kill Friedman?

Try again, and this time be polite.

What you gonna do? Kill me?

What do you mean?

What do you fear most now... my sword?  ... or his hands?

Better today than tomorrow.

I also need someone who can read and write.

He didn't tell you to cut all your hair off...!

What did they say?

Good.

What's going on?!

Not so... easily.  Why aren't you... fighting...?  go on... we're almost there...

The king said you're his finest archer...?

Jeanne...!  Are you alright?

They've abandoned me... like everyone.

I don't know it.  I feel it.

It's a trap!  They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England!

Did you come back to marry me or to insult me?

I will ask my voices... if they come back one day.  Meanwhile... I'm going to Compiegne.

To be killed in battle?

Will you at least let me stay with you?

I'm already free...

Jeanne's alive!

But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!

No...

I can't read.

Arrest them!

But if this trial seems fixed, I fear you'll have the very opposite result to the one you want...

Calm down, my lord, I beg you!

But we can't do that unless she admits to blasphemy...

God defeated the English, not me.

Are you alright?  Did they hurt you?

Quick -- hide in here...

Don't worry about me -- just stay in here... and don't move!

The English??

Take the Holy Gospels in your hand and swear to tell the whole truth concerning everything you will be asked.

Recite the Lord's Prayer.

The voice was in your cell?

It is for us to determine whether you are a good Christian, not you.

I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!

Not so well, I regret to say.  This business with the Maiden... it's caused him endless grief and torment.  That's why he's entrusted me with the task of... shall we say...

This word is -- regrettably appropriate for the situation.  In fact what we -- the Church -- wish to do is determine whether or not this girl is sent by God, as she claims.  You understand that we cannot allow just anybody to abuse God's name in this manner...

You will??

It's true.  There's only one king... people need to be reminded of that. Nevertheless... Jeanne has done so much for us...

Don't worry, Charles.  If God is still with her, she will be victorious.  We're not her judges... we're just spectators.  Let her go to Compiegne, as you let her go to Orleans, and let God decide her fate.

I don't need lodgings if we're to be marching on Orleans...

So how would you put it?

Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!

Is it long and hanging down?

It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings.  His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.

8,000.  We can't raise more... We can only place ourselves at the mercy of your generosity.

Were you sent by Lord Dunois?

Ah, so that's it.  To you I'm just a girl.

What's going on?

God... why of course -- we'd forgotten about him!  Strange, I don't seem to remember seeing him at Agincourt.

I do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked!

This is no good!

We return to Orleans... across the bridge, at the Tourelles.

Jeanne... The men are exhausted!

Who told you to wear men's clothes?

Did your voice tell you to jump?

So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?

And you didn't jump of your free will?

La Hire, I'm warning you -- don't swear!

Prepare these as battering-rams!

We... won?!

You call this... glory...?  All this... this blood... this smell of...

Who gave you that horse?

What have you done to me?

I... don't know... what do you want from me?

I am true -- to my Lord, the King of Heaven.  He knows how much I love him -- that's all that matters to me...

Why?  Are you waiting for someone else?

My... visions...

No, no -- you can't stay or they won't come!

Why would they?

"Let all who love me follow me"... Where does God get mentioned?  Come on Jeanne, be honest.  You fought for yourself, in your name.

My voices... my voices... do you think they will ever come back?

Oh yes... very.

Good, good.  And your sister... Catherine -- she's still your best friend?

So... everything sounds... wonderful?

Him?

Beautiful.

I'm sorry, Mr Wladek, he wants you to stop.

Why are you here, Mr. Wladek?

I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.

Hello.

Wladyslaw Szpilman.

Sit.

I've been in hiding. I need somewhere to stay.

How long have you been married?

Will I still be able to play?

Must feel better this side of the wall.

Have you seen this?

Halina?

Henryk's in there.

Believe me, they've picked him up.

Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.

We're recruiting.

And, please, tonight, for once, I don't want anything bad talked about. Let's enjoy our meal.

What's that mean, no employment certificate?

No one thought they'd hold out so long.

Jehuda, give me something to do.

There are notices going up. The city's to be cleansed of undesirables.

I thought you'd be off on tour, playing London, Paris, New York?

Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you?

Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek...

Pig!

Dirty pig!

How long have you been here?

I tried your friends. They're not at that address any more.  But.

Pack, darling, get your things, pack.

No, no, no, I'm staying put. If I'm going to die, I prefer to die at home.

You don't remember me, Mr. Szpilman?

I don't know how to thank you.

What about you?

Well you stopped combing your hair, which is a good thing, it was looking over done.  You see these are the slits that the heads will go through, show him Nessie ... they'll be dead, the Reverend is going to use animal blood, no doubt it will be very dramatic. Tea! 

I knew she was mute, but now I'm thinking it's more than that. I'm wondering if she's not brain affected.

I got the good wife for you Peini. She pray good. Clean. Read Bible. You sleep her Peini. She chief daughter.

I worry for you.

Well, I doubt I want it very much myself.

No, but her words are in my head.  I know what you think, that it's a trick, that I'm making it up. No, the words I heard, were her words.

Please take us to the beach where we landed.

You have to wash them.

She wants it to come.

We can't leave the piano

Hello, then.

Mama.

Lieutenant Snyder.  Bunco.

Nobody.  I just know what kinda women he likes.  I'm gonna check all the joyhouses till I find him.

What are ya gonna do, call the cops?

...It's the only reason I ain't quit before now.

I'm out, Johnny.

I just got the count.  We'll put the take on the 4:15.

Straight north.  He was gonna take it all and run.

How do you like that Coleman, huh? After three years.

We were partners.  If it weren't for Luther I'd still be hustlin' pinball down at Gianelli's.  I don't need anything more than I got.

I thought you blew all your money.

It's important.  We had a little trouble in Chicago today.  One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.

Mottola.

Name's Danny McCoy.  No Neck McCoy we called him.  Runs a few protection rackets for Carnello while he's waiting for something bigger to come along.  Me and Danny been friends since we were six. Take a good look at that face, Floyd, cause if he ever finds out we let one lousy grifter beat us, you'll have to kill him and every other hood in Chicago who'd like to do the same thing.  You understand what I'm sayin'?

I've had it with that bum, Floyd. Stack me a cooler.

I don't care.  Load me a deck.  Set it up for threes and nines.  I'll cut it in on his deal.

All right, I'll rent ya everything I got in the warehouse for two grand.  That'll give ya phones, cages, blackboards and ticker gear. You supply the guys to move 'em. If you want a counter and bar, that's another grand.  I don't know where the hell I'm gonna get 'em though.

You want the stuff tomorrow or don't ya?  It's gonna take hours just to clean it up.  Besides, Gondorff's still a hot item.  Where am I gonna be if he gets hit?

We bought ya a tap into Moe Anenberg's wire.  He's got eyes at every track in the country.  You'll get race results, odds, scratches, pole positions, everything; and just as fast as Western Union gets 'em.

I'm sorry about Luther.  He was the best street worker I ever saw.

You gonna stay for breakfast, or do you already know how to eat?

Gondorff, you gonna teach me the Big Con or not?

How 'bout Lonnegan?

Take it easy, you won't lose him now.  We had him 10 years ago when he decided to be somebody.  Believe me, I've seen enough to know.

You wanta wait for your share?

All you gotta do is show up with some money and look like a fool.

Looks like he's sulking.

Yeh, that'd be real nice of ya, Mr. Lonneman.

See and raise five.

Excuse me, sir.  Treasury Dept... I'd like to ask you a few questions.

You done?

You got a back door to this place?

Look, I don't have time to fuck around.  There's somebody out there I don't need to see.  You got a fire escape or anything?

Looks like he missed ya.

I don't even know you.

Twist?  I told him the tale.  He wants to see ya.

I thought it might be good for him to see the setup.

You're dreamin', kid.

You're not gonna break him with a $2,000 bet.

'Cause it's better to do it all at once.  We're puttin' down 400 grand next week.  At 5-1 we make 2 million. Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.

You stayin' in or not?

You got nothin' on me.

I mean completely played.  Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.

Can't do it.  There're telegraph inspectors all over the place.  I got 750 grand coming in from the coast, and I'm not gonna blow it for a lousy 14 gees.  We'll get somebody else to do our betting.

Do ya know him or don't ya?

Well we do.  He's chummin' around with a Big C named Henry Gondorff. Ring any bells?

There's word he's gonna run a con on the North Side here.  We got a year-old Florida warrant on him, but it's a thin beef, and he can beat it in court unless we catch him cold.  All we want you to do is pick up Hooker for us.

Don't crack wise to me, flatfoot. I spent a lotta time in dumps like this, eatin' Gondorff's dust while the bunco squad gets rich tippin' him off.  But it's not gonna happen this time.  We're not even gonna let the police know we're here.  If you keep your mouth shut and do a job, there'll be a promotion in it for ya.  And you better take it, cause I can make ya work for us without it.

Yes.  He admitted it.

Why not?

Darling, your father's all right. He'll turn up in time.

And don't ever try to see me again.

You don't understand.  You don't know what's going to happen.

That isn't true.  It was about your father.  Where is he?

Mother ....  you couldn't do that. You couldn't go to her.

Don't.  It's horrible.

Aren't you Nick Charles?

That's what I was going to ask you.  he's disappeared!

Come on in.

Why... in the heart.

Where did you get this gun?

Dead?

He'll still be your son-in-law!

This is my wedding.

I'd like to see him.  Why don't you bring him down?

Shrapnel!

That woman!

Did you kill her?

Ask him.  I don't know.

Not without a warrant.

What about the suicide?

I haven't got that far yet.  But I don't think that everything points to Wynant.  What about the alibis?

What about Jorgensen?

"D.W.R."  That case you worked on... the guy who threatened to kill Wynant... what what was his name?

He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.

What're you doing here?

You mean that body-----?

You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?

Are you sure you didn't leave the room...  that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?

That's ridiculous.

We're just having a little drink.

No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.

I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.

That's a fine thing to throw up to me after all I've been to you....

Oh, hello.  Come on in.

I got word from Wynant this morning...

Oh, please, Nick.

I wish you'd count them.  There's a thousand dollars there.

I see.  I see.

How are you?

What are the chances of getting you to do what he wants?

I've done that already. He should appear, you know.  It doesn't look well... his staying away at a time like this.

But it must have been Wynant.  I should have known if it weren't his voice.

Oh, Nick... Nick!

But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.

Where's Gilbert?

I tell you -- he didn't do it.

That's all swell.  Only you're peddling your fish in the wrong market. I've got nothing to do with it.

What's that?

What am I?  The fall guy?

You might have mentioned me first.

You got types?

Who's that?

What are you going to do with it?

Nick!  Nick!  Are you asleep?

No thanks.

I'd like to see you work.

It's all right.  It just grazed me.

Sure -- I don't even feel it.

You're a fine watch dog.

On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!

Who gave it to you?

Nick - I won't have you going down there.

Don't say it that way. Say it as if you meant it.

I want you to stay and find Wynant.

Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.

I'm going to tell her.

But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...

Why not?

What are you going to do?

Yes!

Who do you think did it?

Serve the nuts - I mean, serve the guests the nuts.

Why are you saying it?

You worked here?

You can save that and tell it to the police.  They'll be here in a minute.

That's what Mr. Wynant said to me. If she re-married, all the money was to go to the children.

Well, congratulations.

Home?

What's in the other direction?

...And it's very important when you sit down never to point the soles of your shoes at anyone.  It's considered offensive.

Paper.

You're out of your minds, you know that? Both of you.  You don't even know if there's anything out there.  What the hell are you thinking?

Yeah!  Welcome to beautiful Iraq.  Land of enchantment and riches.

They shouldn't have been here.

What if it's a Valloro 69?  Just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us.

Ready?

All right.  Let's break out some utility shovels, lanterns, and a claymore in case we have to do any blasting.  Me and Jaeger'll climb down, and see what we can see.

You ready?

You're the one with all the ideas.

Maybe you've got ideas of your own for the gold.  Maybe you've already got things worked out.

You got no reason to hit me.  I'm getting tired of you and Jaeger pushing me around.

Says they were deserters, they were afraid to fight, don't believe in Saddam anyway.  They flew the gunship up here to hide out.  When they saw us they figured we were going to kill them, so they shot first.

You're out of your mind.

I'm the one's got the big stick.

You disappoint me, Epps.  Always figured you to be a man; a real bright guy.  I had respect for you.

Give it to me!

You all want to lay off?  God.  I hope the Iraqis shoot me; put me out of my misery.

It's war.  People get lost all the time in war, cut off--

You're getting gold, and you're going to blow it on wheels?

Invest it.

They're not going to--

It'd make their heads explode.

And you missed this?  How are you going to miss something like this?

Hey...hey!  Slow up.  You don't have to go so fast.

If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now.  Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore.

Where you going?

This.  Whatever it is.

Where is it?  Where'd it go?

It's just a mongoose.

I don't see how that plan's any better.

Wes might be right about that.

What are we going to do?  How are we going to find our way back!?

We got to go back.  We got to go back for Wes.

No.

And you; you've got it all together.

I don't want to die.

Epps...Epps!  I'm gonna stop for a second.

Just let me rest for a second.

Oh, God...

Slip out your M-16.

And then shoot them.

What do we do?

To where?

We can't just sit here waiting to die.

I didn't say that.  I never said--

Can you ride a horse?

Why do I have to lie in the road?

Yeah, but why me?  What if the car doesn't stop?

Epps?

I've never been anywhere.  I wouldn't know where to go.  Where would you go?

Australia.

I'd go to Australia.  Lot of land, not many people.  I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile.  And the girls go crazy for brothers down there.

Woods.

People are suffering.

Come on.  You're going to get us in trouble.

Spanish wasn't hard enough?

And you're the guy who's going to open it.

Jaeger?

You ever think about dying?

The longer the air force hits the Iraqis, the safer it'II be for us when we have to engage.

That's it.  It's over.  Eighteen hours into the war and it's over.

God!  I don't believe I'm doing this.  I don't.

Epps, is that a sand dune.

Jesus!  What the hell did he do that for? They're Iraqis.  Why are Iraqis killing Iraqis?

You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.

You down?

What the hell are you doing!?

With what?  He doesn't have a weapon.

I think he wants something to drink.

Maybe we ought to...you know, bury him. Say some words over him.

Think the Iraqi's killed them all?

Stress category.

Drug evasion with assorted perversions

Control ON.

No, your going to eat it, or it will go to waste.

What's this?  Why did you change it?

What did you get?

When?

I have to... he's a G-34

Then why did you bring it up?

Now...now, I'm sorry...don't - don't....please.  It's just... I was happy.  Why get me involved? You told SEN that you weren't satisfied with me.

I was so scared...I didn't know what would happen with you...once I started.  I almost let you go on so many times.  It will be worth it, together.  When I was alone, I knew.

If you....if you go back on sedation, you won't feel the same way about me.  You'll report me for drug evasion.

Then what?  It can't go on forever. You know it can't.

Are you all right?

You always manage to avoid the issue:  What's wrong with our present condition?  We're COMFORTABLE and we have plenty of food...I feel absolutely no threat because there is no threat. Why incite trouble?  You should examine your emotions.  It is senseless...

What's going on....what are you doing?

What?

Who?  Who's leaving?

I can't see him at all.  He's been destroyed.

What's going on?

I don't understand. Living....selection is computed. You can't... What have you done to LUH?  She was here..

How do you know?

I don't know.

What was that....

Remember this...?

Just look at all those people.

Yes.

Yes

....I'm taking SP5, but it doesn't seem strong enough.  I have a hard time concentrating.  Please forgive me, I slipped on....

Who the heck're you?

Where did you get this?

What was-? Why...?

What?

By the way, I'm Glass. This is T.J., and Pooch.

An abandoned machine shop... nice place to build devices. Low rent, too. But, you and Rice ruined their perfect hideout.

Redstone's the army training center in Alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers.

How long are we going to stay?

Right.

You guys seem pretty tight.

Why do you do it?

Which one's which?

What's up?

Should we head for the Interstate?

Talk to me. Let's assess.

C'mon, talk to me! We can do it!

Hey, matches are a very big thing in our line of work.

No, we're terrorists, stay back or we'll blow.

We've lost brothers too, we know what that's like.

C4, plastic explosive.

Computer device?

What do ay say?

Then why tell me?

Why are we stopping here?

No... No more killing.

I want to work this.

What the hell was that?

It's a bluff. The guy's full of crap.

What the hell's going on?

I'm filing charges against that mother-

Good boy, Schnoz. Daddy loves you.

That's one more time than any of the rest of us have seen it.

Reilly, Vice. I-

Make an appointment.

A what?

Got it! Ace Match Company, Flint, Michigan.

Take it down to the Bomb Squad, Artie-

Sir...

Yes, sir.

Glass, sorry about Pooch, he was a good man. We don't have time to give you a break right now, we're going ahead and-

It's our only option.

Yes.

Yes.

M'sieu Laval, M'sieu Filiba would like very much to see you.

Is this what you mean, M'sieu Laval?

With the compliments of Colet and Company!

<u>Niente!</u>

<u>Tonsili!</u>

Yes, M'sieu Filiba?

But before I say goodbye I want to ask you one question: Have you ever been in Venice?

No.

No!

No doubt about it--it's that secretary.

No color, no sparkle--but dependable.

He's really not a bad fellow.

Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.

And, waiter--you see that moon?

I want to see that moon in the champagne.

And as for you, waiter--

M'sieu Laval, there are several things I've wanted to ask you for quite a while. I understand you are from Marseilles.

You must be related to the Lavals of Marseilles.

M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the confidence of this family--

Two weeks and three days.

Are <u>you</u> insinuating anything, M'sieu Giron?

And I don't see any reason for any man getting nervous when somebody checks over the figures of his report.

I'm very sorry, but this is no time, M'sieu Giron--

But not now.

Yes, m'sieu.

Very well, m'sieu.

Yes, m'sieu.  M'sieu Giron!

Monescu.

Who?

Thank you!

<u>This</u> <u>woman</u> <u>has</u> <u>more</u> <u>than</u> <u>jewelry</u>.

By the way, how is your German?

<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.

You <u>have</u> to get out of here!

Lily, you must listen to me.

Goodbye--Madame Colet and Company! 

Well--how do you do, M'sieu Laval?

Naturally I did.

Do you know my first name?

Oh? 

Then you use the wrong lipstick--

It's disgraceful!

Yes, madame?

Like that!

Any minute I want!

Then why do you want to go?

Yes, Gaston?

You have been robbed--for years. And not a hundred thousand francs, but millions. And you know who did it? Adolph.

Adolph J. Giron.

Goodbye...

Wonderful ... But tomorrow morning, if you should wake out of your dreams and hear a knock, and the door opens, and there, instead of a maid with a breakfast tray, stands a policeman with a warrant--then you'll be glad you're alone.

Lovely.

Oh, no, it's the way you lead.

Madame Colet, I've enjoyed the confidence of your family for more than forty years.  I was a school friend of your husband's ...

Madame, let me ask you: Who is M'sieu Laval, anyhow? Where does he come from? What is he?

You've had your breakfast--oh, but of course you have.

Your bag?

Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.

How much time?

I'm in the sitting room. Heading for bedroom B-54.

She says she's Rose DeWitt Bukater, right? Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the Titanic. At the age of 17. If she'd've lived, she'd be over a hundred now.

So let me get this right. You were gonna kill yourself by jumping off the Titanic?  That's great!

This is Brock Lovett. What can I do for you, Mrs...?

She's not on the starboard side either.

The one on the other side is letting men in.

We're too late.

It's just the God damned English doing everything by the book.

You told me to change.

My God... Cal. Is it a --

I had hoped you would come to me last night.

Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.

You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?

There are boats on the other side that are allowing men in. Jack and I can get off safely. Both of us.

Goin' home... to the land o' the free and the home of the real hot- dogs! On the TITANIC!! We're ridin' in high style now! We're practically goddamned royalty, ragazzo mio!!

I don't understand a one of you. What's the matter with you? It's your men back there! We got plenty a' room for more.

Why have we stopped?

Hello again.

Mr. Dawson, I --

Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are.

A whole ten cents?!

I think I would.  And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair.

I don't know the steps.

You're not one of them. There's been a mistake.

You're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really.

Fabrizio said you might be up --

Cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere.

Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.

Where to, Miss?

You're trembling.

When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you.

It's bad.

Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!

That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket.

Will this work?

It's getting quiet.

Wait! Can you give us something go on, here. Like who had access to the safe. What about this Lovejoy guy? The valet. Did he have the combination?

I'm sorry.

There, that's nice. I have to have my pictures when I travel. And Freddy of course.  Isn't that right, sweetie.

Rose, get in the boat!

It would be a nice change from you.

You're a charming liar. You <U>know</U>, Herbert's too dull to be suspicious about anything--even when I suddenly decided to come to Europe at a few hours' notice--

But, Anya, dear! Unless you play we won't have a fourth.

Well--shall we go into dinner?

Will you please excuse me? I'll be right back.

You're Anya Rosson, aren't you? I've heard of you back in New York.

Will you pardon me?

No-o!

We haven't any chips, Mr. Brett--Do you mind playing with cash?

You're coming back--

Could I see you a minute?

I'm so sorry!

Yes--are you?

She looks like a lot of other boats. I grant you she's beautiful. 

You've got lipstick all over you.

How about giving me another coat?

There's soft music--

This is great. I'll be able to watch your act every night.

Married?

Don't be a c-a-t.

Don't kid me. I'm in no mood for it.

This time I'm really glad you showed up.

I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.

You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring--

Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?

Too much--Remember--I warned you about me--  I used to be Lee Lother's girl--

You can't lose me, Sally--I'm no lily myself!

Oh, putting on the swell, eh?

Quick, let me have that money. I'm broke and I'll need it for tips.

Yer lucky I'm here at all. I tell you, Jimmy--my feet'll never hold out.

Yeah--but high livin's made me soft.

Shortie!--you know my motto?

I'm going to the show--

I wouldn't worry about it--it'll turn up--  How about a nightcap, Inspector?

Hello, young fellow!

Their faces are familiar--but not to each other.

Yes--but don't ask me why--because I could never tell you. I don't know what most guys want out of life--but <U>that</U> would be enough for me--I wouldn't care about-- easy money--or--showing off my smart brains--I'd just like to live <U>my</U> life so nothing I did would bounce back and ruin <U>hers</U>--Do I make myself clear?

O.K., kid--  I'm only sorry for one thing.

Your wife knows that, don't she?

"Will be back in four weeks"--  --that saves you eighty cents right there!

"Will--be--back--in--four--weeks." You don't need the "will be." Just say "Back in four weeks."

Fine! Instead of saying "next month"--we'll use one word and say "June."

Just a minute--Your wife knows her own name, doesn't she?

Yes--Me--in person!

Hello, Denby!

Tell her you're on your way to France and will be back in four weeks.

Oh, there you are--

Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?

Here we are, folks--eighty thousand wild-eyed fans go mad--they go mad as Chad Denby--with the arms of iron, and the nerves of steel--picks up his racket--  What is this thing--a racket or a mallet?

Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.

Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--

I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to do this--

Yes.

Very good, Mary--

With your dry wit and humor--

Get that out of your trunk.

H'mm ... no wonder I have trouble rounding up this show--Don't you know there's a rehearsal going on?-- And you wanted a raise.--Come on--get going or you'll get it!

Oh, Mr. Denby, I wrote a poem about a bracelet--

You're wasting your time--she's a friend of mine.

I went for four.

All right--but what is there to face? It's finished.

I didn't want to see you again--that's my privilege.

Congratulations.

He'll be back.  What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?

I'm all right.

I was in his cabin--

Everything in order, sir?  What are <U>you</U> doing here, my lad?

Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.

Oh, my God...

Newcomers, eh?  Names John Behan, I'm Cochise County Sheriff.  Just Hit town?

So how's Tombstone treating you?

I saw that look pass between you And Wyatt at the fight.  Listen to Me!  You're mine!  Understand? You're my woman and I'm your man.

I asked where you got him.

What'd the Messican mean, a sick Horse's gonna get us?  Didn't make No sense.

I want you to know it's over. We're leaving and we're not Coming back.

Look at that!  Yeah!  Come and get Some, boy!

Not me.  I'm in my prime.

What's wrong, Doc?

Doc!  How the hell are you?

Since when is faro a business?

So tell me, Wyatt.  I'm curious. Do you actually consider youself A married man?  Forsaking all Others?

Maybe I ought to go out there.

Wyatt, my God!  You're shot to pieces!

What makes a man like Ringo, Doc? What makes him do the things he does?

So what does he want?

I played the cards I was dealt, Wyatt.  Your problem is you're Always trying to play someone Else's.  Allow me to tell you the Truth and thus set you free: There is no happiness, Wyatt There is no normal life.  There's Only life, that's all.  Just life. The rest is relative.

You know, Stephen Foster.  "Oh, Susanna".  "Camptown Races", Stephen-stinkin'-Foster!

I don't believe it.  He's clean!

All right, I'm on fire!  Black Seven, seven stickin' spades. Let's go!

You tell Ringo... just tell him I'll be there.

Wyatt, listen, you can't beat Him.  You're good and God knows You got the courage, but you Ain't in Ringo's class.  Hell, He's the best that's ever been. 'Cept maybe for Wild Bill.

We've never actually met.  My Name's-

Oh...  Now she's starting.  How do they know?

Well he's handsome and he's Charming.  He's all right.  For Now.  Don't say it, I know, I'm Rotten.  I can't help it.  I've Tried to be good but it's too Boring.

I must say this certainly has Been an unexpected little Windfall.

What can I get you?

Out ridin'.  So... how you doin'?

Well, I was thinking, we've Already made a pile of money. Maybe we should just pull up Stakes and move on.  And we could Stay on the move, you know?  Just Keep going, see the world.  Live On room service the rest of our Lives.  How'd that be?

Thought you swore you'd never Carry that thing again.

Mattie.  What about this?

All right, look.  I can make it Right, I can make this up to you, Mattie.  I can, I swear.

Well hello, Sherm.

Look, I got a rule.  I don't talk To lawmen.  Dog-catchers neither.

I know that cut.  You mean there's A waterhole near there?

Well how do we look?

Hey Doc!  Come on now.

Listen to me, both of you.  This Is no good.  This is trouble we Don't need.  For the first time in Our lives we got a chance to stop Wandering and finally be a Family.  Do this and you throw it All away.  You saw what happened To Fred White.

What's it look like?  They want a Piece of me they can come and get It, I'm not crawlin' into my hole.

That a fact?

Talked it over.  We decided we Don't need the money.  Took out 13 Dollars each, though.  Federal Posseman's fee.  That all right?

Keep your eye on that brass ring. Don't let anything side-track you.

Maybe I jumped the gun.  Maybe Those Cowboys aren't near as bad As they're painted.  You know I Was thinkin', there's a lot of Money in the cattle business...

Business is business.  Don't have To love 'em to work with 'em.  Not If there's money in it.

Virge, that's a misdemeanor.  You Go down there to arrest 'em, Something goes wrong, maybe this Time somebody gets his head Broke, suddenly it's a mess and It won't end there, you'll have Cowboys comin' around lookin' for Trouble from here to Christmas. You gonna risk all that over a Misdemeanor?

Getting late.  Guess I'll turn in.

See what I mean about it getting Spooky?

Why don't you just leave it alone?

It's too late -

Why wasn't the ship protected?!?! Why was it sailing without radar?

A piece of advice, Mr. Bond: Don't screw with a man who buys ink by the ton.  It's deadlier than uranium.

Mr. Bond! Nice to see you.

Before I became involved with Paris, she was always involved with the most inappropriate' men...  Playboys. Thrill seekers. Middle aged Peter Pans who only brought out the worst in her.

I tried to save her. But she remained a manic depressive: Fits, inappropriate behavior... Delusions of grandeur.

Still, I do miss her. I only wish she could have lived to see all this.

My third great Uncle - the Earl of Aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of Hong Kong from the Chinese.  His son-in-law - George Harmsway - made the first family fortune, running opium into Shanghai...  His son, Thomas, who lost it, smoking the opium... And my grandfather Henry, who opened the first telegraph station, and published the colony's first English newspaper.  It was a city of unlimited possibility.

Welcome to the new world order, Mr. Bond.  Churchill had his armies; Caesar had his legions; I have my divisions:  News, sports, business, entertainment. And these are my foot soldiers:  2000 people working on 14 floors to feed 300 newspapers, 4 cable news networks, 87 magazines, and 29 different cable TV channels - in 35 languages.

I'm sure they will.

...As the advertising says: Tomorrow never lies.

I'd rather die alone.

In the Strait of Malacca, when a boat is even five minutes late, one begins to worry, Mr. Bond.

The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night. Captain blamed the auto-pilot; I suspected he was drunk - until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem.

Next morning. Both boats. Nothing wrong.  My 90 year old grandfather thinks 'Ghost in the computer - Silicon Dragon.'

I'm sorry. It was a national emergency -

Yes -

Oh, James. I've missed you -

Don't you even miss me? Didn't I mean anything to you?

Do you feel better now?

Paris -

Just - say it. Say it just once.

His newspapers?

Gone fishing.

What do you want with the Harbor Master?

Natalya?

I have to get these to London. Do you know this Captain Cheong?

I got you covered.

Interesting presentation.

Vodka martini, shaken not stirred.  And another for you?

Boyfriend?

Nice to run into you again.

- Shut up!

I hope you'll be gentle.

And what do you call this?

You heard me. A gun?  I left mine in the car.

This has got to be a mistake.

Sleep well?

And number two?

And when might that be?

Come in, 007. You know the Minister?

- Along with Tomorrow - the first world-wide newspaper. Circulation 27 million. Daily. -

.... I hate to ask, but... Did you ever think you'd miss Communism?

But if Elliot Harmsway is involved with that uranium, I want him prosecuted to the ends of the earth.

... And what do you call these?

You have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way.

I know my rights. These are international waters. The British Navy abandoned that boat, and I'm claiming it. Under international law, I have the right to salvage what's on that wreck.

The Queen invited you to dinner -

And the 9:30 news meeting is waiting.

A dead head.  Water logged timber. Floats straight up. You sometimes see them on the east side of the channel - from the logging camps on Sumatra - but they don't usually float this far west.  Muncy! Engines to half!

I regret to inform you, sir, that Saddam Hussein is still demanding a bonus for his role in the Gulf War.

Oh, no.

Who is that?!? What's in the box??

Will it go off?

Babe Brother, is that my shirt that you're wearing?

I'll drive her to the hospital.

I'm cold. I need to get out into the sunlight.

I want Sunny to have an advantage that you and I never had, but he needs discipline, and you are not helping when I tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it.

Why does he always pick on me?

It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.

I couldn't believe the things I was doing. It was like an internal struggle going on inside my body.

I need to get my suitcase out of the garage.

Harry is coming to pick me up.

Son, would you do me a favor and see if you could turn off that tap in the bathroom. My hand is too weak. And would you do me another favor? I don't like asking this but would you clean the tub for me? I have trouble bending over.

Let us go back in before the night of celebration becomes a night of me killing my son.

I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up.

How is the garden doing?

Boy, that is bad luck to touch a fellow with a broom.

I came all the way from Detroit by bus going to Oakland. The bus stopped in Los Angeles. I had to get off and take a rest. I'll catch the last bus leaving at midnight. I'm just too tired to go on.

My feet have never been on anything that wasn't directly attached to the ground.

Man, put your boxes down and stay as long as you like. We have empty rooms since the boys got their own families and moved out.

Man, act like this is your home.

Next time when I feel a little better perhaps.

You and Babe Brother hit it off so well.

I tried to teach him right from wrong just like I did his Junior.

One can tell you are from back home. These people nowadays don't know what manners are.

How is everybody?

How is he doing?

Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.

Good God Almighty, bless your bones.  But the problem grows.

I don't know if we could take one in with Rhonda and me at home alone at times.

An empty wagon makes a lot of noise and you, tappy head, you ain't worth the salt you put in greens.

All the people working with us are really doing it 'cause they hate to see suffering.

Some folks take that natural stuff too far.

No, but I might have some Indian Chief Tonic.

I can't accuse him just dry long 80.

What must I do?

We can't really bring another family in here with us.

I'm sorry he got those birds.

How are you?

I didn't mean for you to pay me for that.

But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them.

Can we leave this up 'til we move?

Can I help pump the gas?

Right here in the van.

Hey!  Wow!

What are you doing over there?

Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot.

Well, let's see, we've got double A's --

Yes.  They're Andy's toys.

Right?  Buddy?

Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?

It's not working.  I recharged it before I left.  It should be good for hours --

But -- the hat looked good.  Tell me the hat looked good!  The apron is a bit much, it's not my color...

Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.

Nice work, fellahs.  Good job. Comin' out of the ground -- what a touch!  That was a stroke of genius.

Well, thanks for the ride.

Hi!

Something's screwy here.

I don't know!

What?

Hey!!

A lunchbox?!

Good going, Slink!  Now, just, just tie it on to something!

Ha ha.  That's very funny, Buzz.  This is serious!!

It's Sid!

Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky?

Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha Bravo.

Mission accomplished.  Well done, men.  Pack it up, we're going home.

This town ain't big enough for the two of us!

Woody?!

Curled up on the landing like love locked out!

He can't abide a woman in trousers. He says a woman in trousers is a sin against nature.

Is there anything else I should know about him?

He made that. In his off hours.

What was <i>that</i> in aid of?

You're only a young thing.

He'll murder you when he finds out.

But then I had a brother and a sister left.

No, of course not.  She's one of the top students at her school.

Why does he need money?

How much?

If Manolo hadn't gone and told them what he did then Salazar and Madrigal would never have been brought to justice.  He did a great thing for Tijuana.  He did a great thing for Mexico.

That was a stupid thing you did. Incredibly stupid.

Arnie, do think there's a difference between a reason and an excuse, because I don't think there is.

Like a Grateful Dead Concert.

I think we may have found our Mexican Drug Czar.  It's this General, Salazar.  At least I'll have somebody on the other side I can talk to.

Because I'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert.

Oh, it is?

About the other night, I'm sorry.

Where are you going?

Czar for life, just like a real czar.

None of my friends can fucking believe my dad is the actual Drug Czar.

Hi.

What is wrong with you?  What?  You're going away.  You're getting help somewhere.

Are you kidding...  I'm staying with you --

You know my dad takes eight red cold pills every day?  He and my mom have cocktail hour every night, from six to seven, set your clock, two bourbons --

Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day.

Move 'em to Texas, fry 'em up.

I have dreams about this, actual dreams about busting the top people, the rich people, the white people.

He won.  He was a winner.  That bothers you.

What do we do?

All the professionals keep them in the trunk.

Women's room, stall two.  Should we stop for ice-cream?

I don't really like guns.  You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive.

You planning on going somewhere, Eduardo?  You don't like it here? This is the best situation you're going to have for a long, long time.

This attitude's not gonna help him any, is it?

The worst thing about you, Monty, is you realize the futility of what you're doing and you do it anyway. I wish you could see how transparent you are.  This food tastes like shit.

Fine, then we don't have deal.

That's good coke.

Take this back with you.  Deliver it safely to Tigrillo in San Diego and we have a deal.

You will help me with my other problem.

Relax.  If they were going to kill us they would have done it in the desert.

If you want her to stay out of it, then stop telling her everything. You should learn how to keep a secret.

Please.  Filing a report will not help you find your car.

This is fucking crazy.  Instead of killing us, he sends us on a suicide mission.  Do you know who Frankie Flowers is?  He's a psycho-cokehead- hitman.  A faggot.  He's killed fucking who knows how many people. You'd need half the force to get close to him.  And you can't get their help because he lives in fucking San Diego.

Guzman, Tomas, Esteban --

The cocaine brand, 911, is an East Coast brand, a Juarez Cartel brand, and you must know it usually comes through into El Paso?

That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power?

I hope when you were on the bench, Judge Wakefield, you didn't handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion.

Oh, man --

Can you tell me anything?  Do you have any ideas?

I'm not the police.  I don't care about experimentation.  She's a kid. I'm worried to death.

I don't give a fuck about your parents --

You've been making very good progress against the Tijuana cartel.

Salazar's been taken down.  He was working for Porfirio Madrigal.

Mapping the fucking pig genome. We'll call your dad, he's a neurosurgeon --

Did you tell him?

What?

Well, I've not brought them.

Well, I've not brought them.

I'm sorry.

OK. Same again?

I want the money, Mark, that's all.

This was his nightmare. The dodgiest scam in a lifetime of dodgie scams being perpetrated with three of the most useless and unreliable fuck-ups in town. I knew what was going on in his mind: any trouble in London and he would dump us immediately, one way or another. He had to. If he got caught with a bagful of skag, on top of that armed robbery shit, he was going down for fifteen to twenty. Begbie was hard, but not so hard that he didn't shite it off twenty years in Saughton.

We'll be half-way down the road with the money.

What's your name?

Do you find that this approach usually works, or, let me guess, you've never tried it before. In fact, you don't normally approach girls, am I right? The truth is that you're a quite, sensitive type but if I'm prepared to take a chance I might just get to know the inner you: witty, adventurous, passionate, loving, loyal, a little bit crazy, a little bit bad, but, hey, don't us girls just love that?

Well, what's wrong, boy? Cat got your tongue.

Diane.

In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night.

It's so simple. We buy it at four grand, we punt it at twenty to this guy that Sick Boy knows, and he punts it at sixty. Everyone's happy, everyone's in profit. I put up two. I come away with six.

So long as everyone keeps their mouths shut, we'll not be getting caught.

Well, you're not going to tell anyone, are you, and besides, I thought we could meet up afterwards, maybe go somewhere together.

Happy birthday.

Well, Mr. Renton, I see that you attended the Royal Edinburgh College.

I'm an old boy myself, you know?

Do you recall the school motto?

Strive, hope, believe and conquer.

I'll put the sheets in the washing machine just now.

Following the game at all?

But try too hard --

Screenwriter?

The park?

No, it's not bad, but it's not great either, is it? And in your heart you kind of know that although it sounds all right, it's actually just shite.

Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -

Yeah.

I think Allison had been screaming all day, but it hadn't really registered before. She might have been screaming for a week for all I knew. It's been days since I've heard anyone speak, though surely someone must have said something in all that time, surely to fuck someone must have.

God, you're sick.

Don't know. Maybe Thursday.

I can't believe you did that.

It was my fucking television.

Why?

Why would I want to sell my passport?

How much?

But you don't have the money?

No, I don't think so.

What's on the menu this evening?

Great.

Sounds great, Swanney.

You'll have to send us a postcard.

This had better be good.

It's the great outdoors.

With a starship!

My visual says sunny skies and seventy degrees.

But the shuttle-

You are a master of understatement. They are likely to destroy the planet.

On "The Planet Of Galactic Peace?"

What are you doing?

Come on, Spock. Why didn't you jump in?

Captain?

Life is not a dream.

Yes, Captain.

I could use a shower.

But he does seem familiar?

There was a young student, exceptionally gifted, possessing of great intelligence. It was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of Vulcan. But he was a revolutionary.

You stay out of this!  Why, Spock? Why? I.. All you had to do was pull the trigger.

I ordered you to defend this ship.

Exactly. That is correct. Sybok's mother was a Vulcan princess. Upon her death, Sybok and I were raised as brothers.

How do you know?

It would appear we are too heavy.

Spock... the booster rockets.

Who are you?

We must change our course at once.

No special conditions?

What have I done?

I know you better than that.

Spock?

Why not?

I don't understand...

Are you embezzling?

I don't get it.

Shouldn't you wait till your lawsuit's settled?

Did he say why?

Flynn had Group 7 access.

Oh, I wish you'd forget about that. It was all so long ago. I've totally gotten over it.

Beautiful!

only yes and no...  You're a bit.

I think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file. Just to be safe.

Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.

It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans.

The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.

User requests are what computers are for.

Well I want to communicate --

Dumont!

Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn?

Well, isn't it -- ?

What, just the three of us?

But -- if you're a User -- then everything you've done has been part of a plan ...

Then...

Well -- that's how it is for programs, yes, but --

What about our friend - Sark?

Did we make it?

How did you do that, Flynn?

You're a..."guest" of the Master Control Program. They're going to make you play video games.

He was disoriented in transport, Tron.

Damn! Never fails... minute the warranty runs out...

Hey... !

So...how's the world of serious science?

I'm afraid it's a little late for that. Dillinger's shut off Group 7 access. He must know what you're up to.

Don't even say that. You've got to find that file before he does..

Well, I -- it's just -- I don't know, a User, I mean... Users wrote us. A User even wrote you...

Do you know what he's talking about?

I can't believe how bad it's gotten around here since the MCP started taking over... all the good functions have shut down... everybody looks so dead... I'm afraid to even go out during down-time...

Yes...it can take us across the Sea of Simulation... all the way out of the Game Grid...to the MCP.

What is it?

I mean, it's not like he's saving the world or anything.  He's a sales rep for Chrissakes. Whenever I can't get to sleep I ask him to tell me about his day. Six seconds and I'm out.  But he acts like he's curing cancer or something.

Can you cover me for an hour?

I'm done.

You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin?

Dad, how come you know the words?

Faisil.  You're new on Harry's team, aren't you?

Son of a bitch!

Harry Tasker.  One zero zero two four.

You better watch it.  She might file on you for sexual harassment.

It doesn't mean anything.  She buys antiquities for Khaled.

What?  It's on the way.  She says she's got something for me.

Station wagon?

Copy that.

Look at the way the little punk is driving.  He's all over the place.  Look-- he hasn't signalled once.

So, you wanna play huh?  You little--

Ha!  The little prick ditched you!  That is so goddamn funny.

Abu Kaleem Malik.

He-- Helen.  Helen-- it's Helen. It's Helen, Gib.

Is this national security stuff boring you?

What're you talking about?  We have that.

Give me the page.

I thought this look like your work.

He's got it.

Is this a common thing for you? Cheating?

So your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters?

You think I care about their					* cause?  Or yours?  Not at all.					* See, America is on top now .  .				* .  but so was Rome, once.  All					* civilizations crumble.  One nation succeeding over another. What does it mean in the long run?  The only important thing is to live well.  And...  living					* well takes money.							*

Hi, honey.  How was the flight?

That's fabulous Harry.

What did you tell him?

Come on to bed, you don't have to brush your teeth.

They said you had to run out.

I don't know.  I guess I needed something...

This Simon.  Did you sleep with him?

What do you think?  Of course yes!  What's involved?

So last night was pretty exciting, huh?

What were you doing there?

Harry, what's the matter with you?  Tell them the truth.  We're married, we have a daughter--

What did he give you?

17 years.

Not yet.  But we'll find him.

Let's face it, Harry, the Vette gets 'em wet.  But it's not enough.  If you want to really close escrow, you gotta have an angle.

Doesn't matter.  I like change. You know, constant turnover.  As soon as I close the deal, it's one of two more times, then adios.

You working on someone right now?

But with you, she gets to be hot, right?

Yeeaoowww!!

Beat it.

Look, Harry's not part of this. He's just a sales rep.

Are you sure you weren't followed?

Tell me what happened?

You can trust me completely.

Bye, Daddy! Hope to see you again real soon.

Has he looked through it yet?

Bye-bye.

Not at all. I, this guy here, he's Sonny Chiba.

Great movie. Action-packed!

Where's your car? I'll walk you to it.

You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?

Ask me them again. One by one.

Might be from Tallahassee. But I'm not sure yet.

That's a long time.

Four hundred bucks.

I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.

So he really loved her?

You're a whore?

"Heroes For Sale"?

Is he nice?

What did he do to Arlene?

I do.

Top o' the morning, Mrs. Worley.

Sweetheart, write down your former address.

Is this a joke?

You did it, Quickdraw. I'm so proud of you. You were like a ninja. Did I do my part OK?

Ya know, I used to fuckin' hate airports.

I been in America all my life. I'm due for a change. I wanna see what TV in other countries is like. Besides, it's more dramatic. Where should we fly off to, my little turtledove?

I thought it was what you wanted, Clarence.

Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.

Shit! Nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass things. So you won't eat pussy? Motherfucker, you be up there suckin' niggers'        dicks.

Damn skippy. He like it, too.

What?

Yeah.

Grab a seat there, boy. Want some dinner? Grab yourself an egg roll. We got everything here from a diddle-eyed-Joe to a damned-if-I-know.

Clarence sent a letter?

But you're an actor. I hear these Hollywood guys have it delivered to the set.

Elliot what?

The zoo.

Would you just shut up a minute and let me think?

I got the part on "T.J. Hooker".

In case of what?

Look, Dillinger, Lee Donowitz is not a pimp -

No. But thanks.

Leave the gorillas.

No problem, Elliot. I'm just fuckin' wit ya, that's all. Actually, I'll tell you but you gotta keep it quiet. Understand, if Dick didn't assure me you're good people I'd just tell ya, none of your fuckin' business. But, as a sign of good faith, here it goes: I gotta friend in the department.

What?

He wants to talk ya.

Don't you?

Apparently I'm not as dumb as you thought I am.

But the bottom line is: I'm not Paramount. I have a select group of distributers I deal with. I buy their little movies. Accomplish what I wanna accomplish, end of story. Easy, business-like, very little risk.

Well, then, what's the hurry? Is it true the rights to "Doctor Zhivago" are in arbitration?

You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. "Sophie's Choice", "Ordinary People", "Kramer vs. Kramer", "Gandhi". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.

I think there's a Seven-Up in there.

I really don't know.

Isn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is she a four alarm fire, or what?

What do you want from me?

Keep it.

We do make a cute couple, don't we?

I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question you've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.  Want a Chesterfield?

On their honeymoon.

It's about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago, Drexl Spivey.

I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?

I'm me... I mean, that's me.

If we decided on making him a New York type, could you do that?

Do you believe him?

Or a bit player -

Suspect's words -

Like gang-busters. Now, remember, if you don't want to go to jail, we gotta put your boss in jail.

He knows.

I'll keep lover boy here entertained.  You know the first thing I'll do when she gets here. I think I'll make her suck my dick, and I'll come all in her face. I mean it ain't nuttin' new. She's done it before. But I want you as a audience.  Marty, what the fuck are you doin'?

Naw man, that's some serious shit.

Put it in your pants.

How do you know? You been there?

Yes.

He's at the Beverly Wilshire.

No, sir!

Well?

To be determined by the proper authorities.

We want tough minded people.  Strong mentally.  We've had some...misfortunes with "unstable" types.

It's the kidnap woman -- the one who was with the guy who tied us up.

You think it's July of 1995?  That's the future, James.  Do you think you're living in the future?

Cole!  James Cole!  You escaped from a locked room six years ago.

"Never cry wolf!"

Did something terrible happen to you when you were a child?  Something so bad...?

Oh, Jesus, James!  You killed him!

I told you what I want.  Lock the door!

Mason???

I said I was too young to drive.  I didn't say I was stupid.

You smell so good.

I need help all right.  They're coming after me.

Just like that?  You were in prison?

James, you said he was hiding in the barn...

What does this mean to you?

I want to be here.  In this time.  With you.  I want to become...become a whole person.  I want this to be the present. I want the future to be unknown.

You... you couldn't have heard me.

But maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe you're wrong.  Maybe we're both crazy.

That's what they were up to!  Freeing animals!

What...???

JOSE!

I mashed the spider, didn't I?

I asked you, why did you volunteer?

But you know what's real now?

WHY DON'T WE FORGET MY GODDAMN PSYCHIATRIST AND DEAL WITH THE TASK AT HAND.  THIS IS IMPORTANT.

-- so they get there and they ask the guy real nice for some kind of i.d., and he gets agitated, starts screaming about viruses. Totally irrational, totally disoriented, doesn't know where he is, what day it is, alla that stuff.  All they got was his name.  They figure he's stoned out of his mind, it's some kinda psychotic episode, so they're gonna bring him...

No, thank you.

Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm blind.  Can't you see that?

Maybe I do.

No and I don't plan on sticking around either.  I don't guess I'll be seeing you again.  Take it easy.

One-hundred-thirteen degrees.  That was back in July of forty-seven. Now there ain't no way it's gonna be hotter than that.

It's nonsense.

Where to?

Please, you don't understand.  I have to get out of here.  They're going to come looking for me. They're going to kill me.  If I can't get this ticket then I'm going to have to do things to get out of here.  I don't want to hurt anybody, I just want to leave.

You want somethin'?

Will he be back soon?

Somewhere else?  Mister somewhere else is fifty miles from here.  How you planning on getting it there? You gonna push this heap yourself?

How much time?

Just banged my head.  It was an accident.

That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?

Two-hundred.

It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.

Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.

Two-hundred dollars in hundred- dollar bills.  And this morning you was broke.

No.  We got Miller.  Regular Miller. You want it, or don't you?

Is that right?  Can't say as I blame you for wanting to head out for a bit.  I know I've had my fill of this town.  Sixteen years I've been the law and order here.  So long I forgot why I ever wanted the job in the first place.  Help people, I guess.  Keep the peace.  Problem is there's so much peace around here they don't much need me.  Got a lot of speeders, but they're speeding through miles of nothing so I can't hardly blame them.  Other than that, well, there ain't much to steal.  I reckon that the last big crime we had was, what would you say Mrs. McKenna?  A murder?

I could do that.  'Course we'd have to go back into town.  There'd be a whole crowd of people around when the trunk was opened.  A whole crowd of witnesses.  That wouldn't be too pretty, now would it?

Is that the way you want it, boy?  A bullet in the head in the middle of the desert?  Ends like this and you won't be able to spend a dime of that blood money.

. . .at the very least.  I know there was more than thirty-thousand dollars.  Now, how much did you get?

Who was that on the phone?

What the hell you looking at, girl?

What's the matter?

How could I?  I was sleeping.

I don't hear anything.  You were dreaming.  Or maybe the wind blew something over.

Oh my God, Jake, no.  If it is someone they'll go away.  Or call the police.  Don't go out there.

My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.

Maybe I don't want you to.

No, I've got it.

Accident.

Where you headed?

Somewhere else.  I've never been anywhere else.  Just once.  Years ago.  Went to the state fair.  It was nice, but it wasn't nothing.

I didn't say it bothered me.

Nice house for a Shaman's daughter. You must be good.

No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?

You never did answer my question.

That's not an answer.  What is it you want?

You love him?

It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't.  I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.

I've thought about you every second since I left.  I can still taste you on my lips.

Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?

I could if I had Jake's money.

You don't know?  Jesus Christ! Don't you think you should have found out before we killed him?

Nothing.  There's no safe under here.

I know.  He was to take the fucking money.

Well, nothing.

Now we dump Jake, split the money, then you're on your own.

The trunk.  It's locked.

No.  I swear it.

For Christ's sake, John!  Throw me the keys!

Live there?

I'm not rambling.

You're the one who brought it up. This morning.  In your car.

You meant it.

Because I think you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.

Let's say I do want her dead.  What is it you want?  This morning you weren't a killer.

That's a bit much.

Don't say that.  I had a marriage of convenience with Grace, and look where that's lead.  Well, looks like we got ourselves a pact.

I went to your place.  We talked, just like you told me.  We drove out into the desert . . .

No.

Jake, how much were you going to pay me to do the job?

You could say.  I don't even have it yet.

He did more work on the car.  He wants fifty bucks extra for it.

You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.

Two-hundred dollars.

What happened to your hand?

Got any requests?

Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?

You're not from around here, are you?  Where you from?

You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that one movie.

But you was going to fight for me.

Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.

I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.

Mister!

Get up, Mister!  Don't ever let it be said Toby Tyler beat the living shit out of someone without giving them a fair chance.

Mexico?  You're going to Mexico?

Nooo!

That's a shame, John.  A real shame.

You're the gambler.  You tell me.

Kids.

Yep.  Tore him up good and spat out little, refined pieces of him. Nothing like the embarrassment of having your father refined in front of your classmates to put the anger in a young man.

Just step from the car.  Nice and slow.

You bitch!  You were in on it froom the start!

I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?

I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?

Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.

More or less.

Well, don't say I didn't warn you when things go your way.

You <u>are</u> crazy, you know. Be seeing you, old man.

Then maybe you should've. Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.

Let's see...they're not very imaginative?

Mister!

Who the hell is this!?

Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.

You've got to be--

"Bobby Cooper." What brings you to Superior, Coop?

Would you?

You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.

I'm not rambling.

Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.

How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before. Jesus Christ! <u>You</u> want this job, you don't know how to do this? I guess I should have hired a professional.

Next time you'll do just fine.

I guess this is what they call "ironee"? Hunh?

How the hell did you know where the bedroom's at?

Come on, Jake --

That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's a cool car.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.

You Harlin?

You own this place?

Then why do you call it Harlin's?

Look, Harlin, I've got places to be.

Just banged my head.  It was an accident.

I don't know, but "it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through."  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.

Then you ain't gonna have the car.

...got no day, got no date.  Probably ain't worth a duck's fart . This one here cost me $3.75 and it's got every doodad you can imagine. No sir I'll stick with this .

Look, Harlin.

I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.

Soda.  You got any soda?

I got it.

Thank you, Bobby.

So, what is it you do, Mister...?

That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.

There.  All done.  Lift me down.

I don't know how.

I can't kill, Grace. I can't kill anybody.

What about us?

Are you sure?...  About me, I mean?

Hope is a four-letter word.

Son of a bitch!

Anybody hurt?

You never said anything.  About the drapes.

You broke her heart! You broke your Mama's heart. You stole me! That's right. Fuck it away. But it ain't ever goin' away, cause your Mama -- she's like a hungry ghost baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya alone.

Jake, don't go out there. Call the sheriff.

Is there anything else you wanted to ask me while I'm up?... When was the last time you wore pink? When was the last time you drank soup standing up? Final call for strange questions at two in the morning.

Megan?

Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?

...When you work with clients on machines, do they sometimes just jump up a level or two? Do something they didn't know they were capable of?

He's just laying in bed. He's pretty upset. He won't talk.

Would you like to try going--

He didn't do anything. He just told me his theory... It's sad when patients get like that. They loose reality.

I didn't know that. Mine's still brown.

Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.

What about the game?

How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?

Seventy-five percent? That's not nearly good enough for me. I'm extremely skeptical.

I assumed because of the train.

Just give me a minute.

I thought he was carrying something.

Okay, I don't want to play this game anymore.

Stop messing with my life Elijah. My son almost shot me last night. He wanted to prove you were right.

Are you finished?

I am. I'm helping him with the sale.

No.

I'm not scared.

YOU WON'T GET HURT...

Not really.

In the passenger car?

Is this a religious thing?

...I got a present for you.

You... you ain't even gonna... whip 'em?

If they was just here for the fuckin', how come they lit out the back window?

Where'd you get the money, huh?

Now this Strawberry Alice person, tell me again.

Where's Little Bill for Christ sake?

What'd he say?

I thought... you was an angel.

I didn't mean no offense.  I guess you're the one them cowboys cut up.  Ned an' The Kid, my partners, are they... ?

Free ones?

Oh. Yeah.

Yeah. See?

She could maybe clean up around the place or somethin', but nobody's gonna pay good money for a cut-up whore.

Yeah?

The... Duck of Death.

I believe that to be an accurate description of the events, sir... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which...

Bam! That Walker Colt blew up in his hand... which was a failing common to that model. Now if Corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end.

"Well, Jim," I says, "it makes me sick to see a man struttin' around and packin' two pistols an' a Henry rifle and cryin' like a baby."

They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because...

Good example! Good example of what I'd like to know? He didn't even kill nobody... he couldn't do it no more.

What'd Ned say?

Then... what?

N-no, sir?

What happened? He ain't dead? What's goin' on?

Better re-load it.

Cover me, Kid, while I mount.

Well, that fella today, you shot him alright.

How long you gonna be, Bill?

Three ways?

Got used to my bed. Ain't gonna feel to home out here.

It ain't nothin', don't fret it.  She don't like it much, you goin' off with me.

You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?

You... you remember Eagle Hendershot?

His head was all busted open so's you could see the inside.

Claudia... ain't here, Bill.

Easy, Bill.

Me an' the Kid, we'll head over to the ranch an' as soon as we find him, we'll shoot him. Then we'll come back an' the three of us pick up the money an' head South together.

Who's he?

Three.

The one you rode out after... the one that had the pistol...

He say anythin'... The Kid... ?

Did you... did you... ?

What was you shootin' at us for, anyhow?

Clouds, Kid. We was lookin' at them clouds on account of we got a storm ridin' up our ass.

How many men you killed?  Ain't you gonna answer?

Depends what he told you.  About Bill, you mean?

Well, suppose he does?

I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before.  I'm more killer than him.

Jack. What are you doing here?

A boy came across a body on the beach this morning. Thrown clear when the boat burned. Shot once in the head. Two guys from the F.B.I. just identified him.                     +

I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?

I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus.

Forget him. It's not important. I was trying to make a point.

I'm sure you can understand my hesitation.

It's bullshit. This guy could be L.A.P.D. I think it's a setup.

Me too.

We've met once or twice. Last time was in...

Get out.

I was out of line.

Three million?

What is it Keaton?

What is this?

What if I

Ready?

What about Redfoot?

The answer is no.

I hear you did time with old Spook. Yeah, he was a good egg. I used to run a lot of dope for him. Fuckin' shame he got shivved.

The job got thrown to me by this lawyer.

Some Limey. He's a middle-man for somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask.

Weapons. Misdemeanor two.

No, no, no, no, no.

And I am sure you have a host of wild                   + theories to answer these questions.

That's crazy, Dave and it doesn't matter. He has total immunity and his story checks out. He doesn't know what you want to know.

His name was Arturo Marquez. A petty smuggler out of Argentina. He was arrested in New York last year for trafficking. He escaped to California and got picked up in Long Beach. They were setting up his extradition when he escaped again. Get this - Edie Finneran was called in to advise the proceedings.

Verbal, you know we're trying to help you.

I know you liked Keaton I know you think he was a good man.

Sure. Fifteen years ago, but he was a good thief Anyway, the cops wouldn't let him go legit.

There's nothing in there about Ruby.

Heartwarming. Really, I feel weepy.

You got him wrong.

You think I don't know you held out on the D.A.? What did you leave out of that testimony? I can be on the phone to Ruby Deemer in ten minutes.

You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?

I've got immunity now. What can you possibly offer me?

Oh, but it's not. If I hadn't been nailed in Illinois for running a three card monte in between sets, I never would have took off for New York. I never would have met Keaton, see. That barber shop quartet was the reason for everything.

Then what?

But Keaton had. Edie Finneran was his extradition advisor. She knew who he was and what he knew.

There were no drugs on that boat. It was a hit. A suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger Keyser Soze so Sate had a few thieves put to it. Men he knew he could march into certain death.

I didn't know. I saw him die. I believe he's dead. Christ

You're not safe on your own.

Is he Keyser Soze I don't know, Verbal. It seems to me that Keyser Sate is a shield. Like you said, a spook story, but I know Keaton - and someone out there is pulling strings for you. Stay here and let us protect you.

Mr. Abraham...

Four cases in three years ...

I want to settle this thing and be done with it.  I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.

We thought it was just.

That was our insurance company's recommendation.

... that was a Dr. David Gruber's office ...

This is going to drive the ante up.

You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby.  Were you not?

Anything special about the case?

Thank you.  When Debby...

...to save her and to save the baby.  Is that...

Uh-huh.  Still practice a lot of medicine?

I did.

No further questions.

Thank you, your Honor.  We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetemt and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code:  'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.'  And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now:  we object to the admission of the Xerox form.

Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago.  Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie.  When were you lying?

That's not my handwriting.

Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.

And why, please tell us, would you think that?

What is this going to cost?

It's all right, Mickey.

I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...

...she went in complaining of stomach cramps.  Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.

She getting good care over there?

I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...

...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anaesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.'  Is that what happened to Deborah  Ann Kaye?  She aspirated into her mask?

The most respected ...

The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of ...

He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth.  He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life.  And we can prove that.  What we don't know is why.  What went on in there?  In the O.R.  That's what we'd like to know.  Something went wrong.  And you know what it was.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  What happened?  The phone rang...someone got distracted...what?

I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no  question of that.  It's just a matter of how big...

You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...

What is it?

I could subpoena him if I had a week.

Is the Plaintiff ready?

Yes, Mr. Galvin?

Galvin, look, many years ago...

Are you done?

Mr. Galvin's...

This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?

Pardon?

That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...

I changed my life today.  What did you do?

Why?

They might.  Yes.  That's the point ...is that they might...you see, the jury wants to believe.  They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe.  I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case.   I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve.  And every one of them it's written on their face, `This is a sham.  There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe...maybe...'

I've got to work...

You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed.  It's all right. I'll stay here with you.  It's all right.  Come on...

Do you think it's my fault?

That's not the question.  It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault?  If I'd...if I'd...I never should have taken it.  There was no way that I was going to win.

You told me so.  Maybe you'd get some sympathy.  You came to the wrong place.

You're pressuring yourself...

Dr. Gruber.

I...please.  My wife...my wife's prescription has run out.  If I can call him...

... now who is that ...?

I have to talk to you.

I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...

Okay now.  Cases:  Smith versus State of Michigan.

Brindisi versus Electric Boat.

So what?

Yeah?  How's our new witness?

Are you with me...are you awake...?

Rooney's protecting someone.  Who is she protecting?

She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...

Uh...the admitting nurse...

It's not a good case.  It's a very good case.  A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anaesthetic ...

... I know.  I went ...

... I understand ...

You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...

What did she say?

Another, Frank . . . ?

I want to buy you a drink.

...there are notations every thirty seconds...

But those notations stop...  ...four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...

Franky can't make it.  He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later.  I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.

Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.   Jimmy, gimme another drink.    How are you?

I didn't mean to be that rough.

Yes.

Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.

Nothing.

Hello.

Just let me talk to you.

I've heard that one before, too. I remind you of someone you used to be madly in love with, but she ditched you for another guy, and you've been carrying the torch ever since, and then you saw me and something clicked.  Huh!

Judy Barton.

Well... I've been on blind dates before... Matter of fact, to be honest, I've been picked up before.  Okay.

As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd "take care of me"?

There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the best. Come on.

You want me to dress like her?

Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead!

Judy, it can't make much difference to you. I just want to see how you'd look and I know it won't be the same, but --

Judy, I want to tell you: these few days have been the first happy days I've had in a year.

The color of your hair...

Where shall we go for dinner?

I've got it.  He bends down and bites the back of her neck.

I'm scared.

...We stood there and I kissed her for the last time. And she said, "If lose me, you'll know that I loved you --

We're going up the tower.

I wanted to stop it, I ran up to stop it --

And you were such an apt pupil! What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?!!

Ah, yes! I was a set-up. I was the made-to-order witness. Where is he now?

You don't remember.

Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.  But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it?  What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind...  It's a formal thank-you letter. And a great big apology.

Do you know where you're going?

How can you be sure?

Why?

Do you hear anything?

Where are you now?

Have you been here before?

Where were you born?

What do you remember?

Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her?

If I could find the key... find the beginning put it together...

I should have phoned... but I wanted to see you... be with you...

Where's your husband?

You've been there before. You've seen it.

Here with you.

My love... because I love you.

No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered --

And there! There you see? Her key is on the rack!

Her car is gone.

I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him.

And sit behind a desk?  Chairborne?

Have you had any dizzy spells this week?

It's a brassiere. You know about those things. You're a big boy, now.

Aren't you ever going to get married?

Ah, sweet college days. But you're the one who blew it. I'm still available. Available Ferguson. Say, Midge, do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster?

My... the acrophobia.

Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.

Pop Leibel? Sure.

You'll tell, or you'll be back in that corset! Come on!

Out!

No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife.

Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?

Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.

No, that's not it. Nothing like it.

Well...

Well, if it's absolutely necessary...

Can't do what?

How ya doing?

What's that?

We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then.

It's really a stupid opinion. You have developed an annoying habit of talking for what seems to be no other reason than to hear yourself speak.

No, because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about, which makes 85% of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me.

The floor was wet. She slipped!

Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot. They're on to us.

If you ever touch my minivan again, I'll make you sorry. Real sorry.

Go home!

One idea that if you had fucking listened to, you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars.

Wait!

What do you think you are doing?

Just wait a second. Wait one second. Okay. What are you doing?

Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation, OK? Let's just review our options here.

You don't just casually walk out of a Vegas Casino with a dead woman.

Have you completely lost your mind? So you get her out of here. So you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone?

Sun rises at 5:52.

So that's what we're doing.

She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia.

Would you, shush?! These phones aren't secure!

What?

I didn't do anything! I'll turn your pathetic ass in!

I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work.

That's one idea.

Are you solid with that?

I tell mine that they're little men. I tell them they're strong. They make me feel joy. I let 'em know. So they really know that I need them just as much. You know. Just as much man. And you know, you're their godfather...

Either side you idiot. I'm calling 911.

What are you talking about?

Micheal? Do you have something to tell me?

What?

She's in the bathroom...she's still working.

That's right.

What's goosed?

Oh, Jesus...call the police.

Call 911.

Fuck! Fuck you fucking guys!

That is a load of shit. Personal power has nothing to do with any of this. Tony Robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly, yes, but to give him credit for this, for all of this...Well that's just more than the man deserves.

Easy Boyd.

What?

I don't know! I just want to get married.

Regarding what?

Jesus Boyd you're going to O.D. him.

I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety. Only deal is...you still got Micheal there?

That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.

Blood money. Insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all. In no way have you mentioned that money. And I find that to be very very offensive.

And if you think you can fuck me, don't. Cause I'm fucking insulated Fisher. Protected. Backed up on floppy. Do you get me? I want my fucking money!

The hell I did!

I don't hate women.

False.

If I'm the king of Israel, I say to myself, King, I say to myself, King... Take a good look around. What do I see?

A little gut check time fellas. A time for some serious self-exploration. How do I function? For real? No more bullshit. Can I keep my cool when they bounce my bananas? When they won't play my fucking song? etc, etc. Do you get me? Do you get me?

This is going to stop right now. Right now!

We're goosed.

Stop it!

This is ridiculous.

Can't we do it on the phone?

The wedding cake check?

Photographer?

What else have you forgot?

How do you figure?

He's my friend. He's not a moron.

I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...

You expect more what?

Keith do not trivialize this.

We're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded.

You go down there.

Hello.

Where are you?

This is our honeymoon.

Lois is a mess and Micheal's really upset. Everyone's upset.

That means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids.

What are you talking about?

You killed a prostitute.

You left a dead prostitute out in the desert? Alone?

So what do we do?

I wanted to just take this final opportunity to visit with you. You know, just to be with you, father and son, before you run off and do your own husband, daddy thing.  I'm just so Goddamn proud of you...God knows I didn't always play it right with you...

I'm just so scared of that song. That fucking, "My son just arrived the other day...he says thanks for the ball, come on let's play. I got lots of bills come again next day. He's grown up just like me...My boy is just like me." Gordon fucking Lightfoot, Cat Stevens, whoever, that song just fucking kills me.

Everything okay?

Mike Brenn. Yes. Yes. 14.3 at 7.5 for 6. At 29.83 at 9.  I'm amazed the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed, ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards.

I'll take a ride.

Where did you get that?

Boyd...I don't know man...It just seems to me that ever since you took Tony Robbins self-help thing...you're all fucked-up in the head.

Where's Boyd?

Pup corn?

There.

Well that ought to be about the end of that.

We don't say "love, honor and obey" anymore. And we don't say "till death do us part." Today we say, "respect, honor and cherish, as long as you both do love." How does that sound?

...regression of Modern Man to his most primitive, ape-like state...

The post-Vegas Man.

I'll come to you tonight.

Didn't you say you know how to make vanilla pudding?

Stop this, stop this.

When I wasn't so miserable I used to sell pigs. Begging your pardon, I was more honest than my holy Mother.

Take me there.

How long are you staying?

You've been neglecting the farm, Uncle.

My maid Ramona's daughter. She's a little animal.

How like your aunt you are, even in your walk.

I'm going to make you a nun's cake. It will make your mouth water.

His mother wanted to keep him. She came from a poor family. I was in love with your aunt. I would like to have acknowledged him but I was afraid of losing her. That's why I didn't say anything.

You must think I'm mad.

Yes, I don't want you ever to leave this house.

Sit down, woman, sit down.  You like me, don't you?

Ramona! Ramona!

So, Ramona!

How in hell does it wind up?

You see how much you like her?

Me, rich? Come on!

I don't want you to untie me. Kill him and then I'll give you the money.

You wouldn't be here otherwise.

I don't know -- they've always been there.

Miss Viridiana ...

Don't forget the meeting with the lawyer. The car will pick you up tomorrow morning.

He's good at rabbiting and he knows it. When we're in the country, if he doesn't hunt he doesn't get fed.

And remember, the less he eats, the better he runs.

Why are you crying?

Yes -- very, very big!

Have you repaired the windows of the dormitories?

You have decided to leave, Moncho.

I hardly know him. I saw him only once, some years ago. I can't even remember him.

But why does he want to see me? He has never bothered about me.

Ever since yesterday, when we heard by chance about the tragedy, we have been very anxious for you. Why didn't you write? I would have come immediately.

Is there some grave impediment which prevents you from taking your vows? There must be something.

Have I slept long?

Hello.

We don't know how, but Sid 6.7 made himself into an android.

Do I need to remind you what happened to his wife? To his daughter?  I will stake my reputation that Barnes didn't kill those guards.

You all right?

You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?

She's going to help you understand what makes Sid 6.7 tick.

Officers in Toluca Lake just found an affluent couple...completely gutted.  So were the first two cops to arrive on scene.

Sid 6.7 is now armed.

What's the assignment?

Not if you're with him every step of the way.

Think you can do it?

Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. I don't know where...

You know how much man power you're talking about?

What did Cox pull him out early for?

Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world.

It makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform.  I will never forget the first time I saw the photos from the crime scene.

Get that fucking thing away from me!

I told you this would work.. By setting back the clocks, he has absolutely no idea he's in virtual reality. He still thinks he's in the real world.

Don't be angry with me, Daryl.

Should I have?

What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here?

A little less than yesterday.

You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it  I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you.

Learn anything from Lindenmeyer's file?

What are you doing?

The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.

What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the sonof-a-bitch before he kills anybody else.

What does that mean?

Sounds to me like a welleducated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.

It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences.  Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media.

Which way?

Grimes is back! He's back! He's come back!!!

Nice work.

Find out anything?

It's really too bad you have to miss the Grand Finale.

As long as they keep overpaying me, I'll keep overpaying you.  ) Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month.

What if he's busy tonight?

Y'see, <u>this</u> is what Producing is:  you put me in a <u>Room</u>...

Okay.  Here's what we're gonna do.

...this is a snappy song....

We've got to put that, into the Inaugural.  "I have here, a ribbon.  You haven't seen it before, and you will not see it too often <u>now</u>.  For it is the Proud Possession of a few, a very few Men and Women... it is the Ribbon of the Albanian Campaign...."

He, uh, has he been in the "jail" long?

What happens if he doesn't have his medication?

...where?

<u>Fuck</u> the world.  Try a ten A.M. <u>pitch</u> meeting, no sleep, coked-to-the-gills, and you haven't even read the <u>material</u>.

Alright.  Look here, any of you kids hear in this room:  what you hear here, what you say here, what you <u>do</u> here, f'it got out, you leaked it.  Tell'em what they need to know.

Three minutes.  It couldn't have been over three minutes, the Secret Service...

Front page.  Washington Post.  Tomorrow.

It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie --

It won't hold.

What would do that...?

Gimme twenty thousand dollars.

What did they ever do <u>for</u> us...?  You see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 Bomber.

The thing with the Yellow Ribbon...

Waal, that's where you <u>want</u> em...

Why is this putz on the air...

Catching up on his reading.  Asked about you, sends his thanks.

How long you been up, you need a nap.

He just got Hip to us.  He just ended the War.

All Combat takes place at night, in the Rain, and at the Junction of four Map Segments...

... you want Schumann saved by an Illegal Alien...?

Stanley, you can't do this....

And I take this <u>opportunity</u> to suggest that, equally, I admit to <u>nothing</u>, and that I would like my lawyer present.

As are we all, and I'd like to take this opportunity to suggest that the Security of the country would be ill- served by any, any...any...

THE PLANE, IN A VIOLENT RAINSTORM, BUCKING WILDLY.  AMES, ON HIS KNEES, GATHERING UP THE PILLS, REPLACES THEM IN THE VIAL, SHAKES OUT TWO, AND GIVES THEM TO SCHUMANN.  WHO TAKES THEM.  MOSS THEN STRAPS HIMSELF BACK IN AND BREAN CONTINUES TALKING ON THE TELEPHONE.

YOUNG PERSON'S APARTMENT, NIGHT.

THE CROWDS AT ANDREW'S AIRKORCE BASE, THE "OLD SHOE" BANNERS, THE "COURAGE, MOM," BANNERS.  THE STILL BAND.  A SHOT OF THE BANDMASTER, SURREPTITIOUSLY, GLANCING AT HIS WATCH.

This is nothing. ...piece of cake.  Y'know, producing is being a Samurai Warrior.  They pay you, day in, day out, for Years, so that, ONE DAY, when <u>called</u> upon, you can respond, your training At Its Peak, and save the day.

Hello...?

Captain...  You wanna Take'er up...?

Whaddaya think?

Course there's a war.  I'm watching it on Television.

My name is Ronald Brean.

What's on your mind?

...Yes.

Touchdown, Andrews, fourteen hundred, today.

How much...?

What one has to do, Mr. Moss.  Is to fight a holding action.

If we can hold the break-in-the-dam for ten days, til the election, we...

It's like being a producer, Mr. Moss.  The Things in Trouble.  Somebody's got to wade in, save the thing.  You get the Actors get up there, and strut and <u>Posture</u>.  But somebody, knows what's what, got to jump in and Save the Thing. 

"They Got To Know?"  <u>Stan</u>...?  Get with it.  Who Killed Kennedy...?  I read the first draft of the Warren Report, said he was killed by a Drunk <u>Driver</u>.  You watched the Gulf War.  What did you see?  Day after day, the one "Smart Bomb" falling into a building. The <u>truth</u>, I was in the building when they <u>shot</u> that shot, they shot it in a studio, Falls Church Virginia, 1/10th scale model of a building.

You know, you're a <u>writer</u>, that's your script.  You're a <u>director</u>...  But if you're the <u>producer</u> ... what did you do?  What did you do?  All you've got is the <u>credit</u>...  Some plaque on the wall...

Well, you could <u>have</u> one, but it'd be a very ineffective war...  We're <u>done</u> in 10 days...

W...what?

In the Folk Music Section.

Where is he now?

What?

Inaugural Speech, press corp's gonna be jealous of giving up that one...

Hell, yes, we're, we're on our way to get him now.  No. Lookit:  it's like a girl with her virginity, y'understand...

Whattaya gonna do when this is all over?

Medal.  Medal and Ribbon.

 A slight, a slight, well, no, we're gonna <u>deal</u> with it, we just, I need a little readjustment...we need to re<u>think</u>...

An anti-psychotic...

He's supposed to be flying in from Europe.

Some'b'y'll have you killed.

You would be, two, if you'd gone through what he went through.

What he went through in <u>Albania</u>...

No, I'm fine... I got it together....

Pals:  Get on the <u>phone</u>... r'they flying it?

But you always knew you couldn't <u>take</u> the credit....

Look, look, look, look, Canada, okay...?  Our neighbor to the North, alla sudden, transformed, into That Place, where, like the North Wind, <u>Terror</u> comes...

...what am I <u>doing</u>?  Do you see me working...?  Here's what you want to do, you want to come out of the box, an item, someone 'ready <u>has</u>, but <u>then</u> you sell it to'em.  Torn <u>jeans</u>, uh ... faded Levi Jackets, uh... uh...

Why can't it be a ribbon?

Shoes, Hats....

I didn't ask for a dog.

Albania, Albania, Albania, James bond Villains.

They guard our, <u>you</u> know ... "borders," night and day...

...by you?

The Special Anti-Terrorist Detachment of the Border Patrol... what do they <u>do</u>...?

Someone's bringing in a kitten...?

...you're gonna Punch in a Kitten Later.

Yup.

Lemme talk to him.  Will?  Shoe?

Fox says Bluestar just hit 23. What do you want him to do?

If I'm closing out this account. If he doesn't pay for it tomorrow, you pay for it.

I told you not to go into that racket. You could've been a doctor or a lawyer,

You get on the phone and ask strangers for their money, right? You're a salesman.

I don't get it, you get a scholarship to NYU, you get 35,000 the first year, and 50 last year, where the hell is it?

The FAA announcement.

Sure...lots of guys at the track talk like that... but how do you know you'll have any dough next month...  What's this? I gave you two hundred.

I guess it's time to hit the road.

Dad, I'm going to jail and you know it.

...And you're even lovelier than I pictured. I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko.

Sure, and I'm never gonna die either, is this one of your chain letter schemes or do I gotta buy a door to door cosmetic franchise in Northern Arkansas?

I told him I was in the bathroom and I'd call him right back. What the hell was I supposed to say Buddy, you got me into...

You sure?

I got this guy who should know tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I been burned on tips. What do you think Bud?

Can't complain. Got a house in Oyster Bay. Market treating you good? Still seeing that sexy French gal?

Okay.

Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure. Has an LCD readout, and it's cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor.

...don't like airlines, lousy unions...

...for my kid Rudy -- 3 years old, electronics freak, got a liquid crystal display 'stead of an electronic beam. We're going into a new age pal. So how's business today.

Revenge is a dish best served cold... well, it's payback time, sport.  ... see that building? I bought into it ten years ago. It was my first real estate deal. I sold it a couple of years later and made an $800,000 dollar profit. It was better than sex. At that time I thought that was all tne money in the world...  Now, it's a day's pay ... I had a mole in Wildman's employ. Gave me half the picture, then he got fired...

I'll be right there, fix them a drink.

He's right. I had to sell. The key to the game is your capital reserves. You don't have enough, you can't pee in the tall weeds with the big dogs.

The art of which is deception. Spread the buy orders through different accounts and you won't get burned...

It's all about bucks, kid, the rest is conversation...  Bud, you're still going to be president. And when the time comes, you'll parachute out a rich man. With the money you're going to make, your father won't have to work another day in his life.

The richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds of it comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do -- stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth. I create nothing; I own. We make the rules, Buddy, the news, war, peace, famine, upheaval; the cost of a paper clip.  We pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it...  ...you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you, Buddy? It's the free market. You're one of us now...take advantage of it. You got the killer instinct, kid, stick with me. I got things to teach you...

Gordon, it's two minutes to close. What do you want to do?! Decide.

Destiny took us apart, but I knew it would bring us back together.

Oh really?  Well, I guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye, because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last June.

Where is it?

If I could have anything... this would almost do.

Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm not going to take a cut. I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $100,000. Curtains alone...

Sure, why not, money's the sex of the 80's. I never had it like you when I was growing up, baby, it wasn't the upper east side.

...that changes all my plans, I thought you were loaded...

You got a look in your eye, Mr. Mannheim... You got something for the small fry...

I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?

Fine, if you don't want us, stay with the scum in present management--dedicated to running you and Bluestar into the ground.

I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.

I can't...and I won't.

... just got 250,000 shares at 18 1/4 from Janson, think I'll pull twice that at 18 1/2 outta the California pensions. We got close to half a million shares in the bag.

And, I'm pretty sure we got the Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming in with us and I'm working on the Silverberg boys in Canada.

The same interest as yours Larry. Money. I thought it'd be a good investment for my kid...

Considering you brought my mother into it, $71.50.

Are you prepared to put that in writing?

Cards are on the table. What do you think?

We know what you're up to, Gekko, and let me tell you this from here,  you suck eggs, mister, over my dead body you ain't gonna break up Bluestar.

Listen, you clowns, there's somebody else out there trying to buy your airline, if you want to be Pac-manned and gobbled by Atilla the Hun be my guest!

Yeah 

Well if you're in such a rush darling, why don't you lead the way?

Would you like a closer look?

Will you be wanting your wheels today sir?

She went to a waxwork party

I hope you enjoyed your visit.

I can't believe she went out with that monster last night

This time I really don't see anyone man.

No thank you sir we're fine.

Well?

If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either

Any student of Black Magic can do it.   .most of these books will tell you how! SARAH So what happens when you've sold out?

Darling?  I hear you were having drinks with the butler the other night.  Now  you know that sort of thing leads to anarchy.

One has to keep the distance between `them' and `us'

Save it for the powder room babe, this man is in pain

I know that.

I started seeing things.

What?

Fireball?

These are good.

Pretty.  She's a blond.

Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.

What?

Whether you imagined it or not, you actually saw and heard things that frightened you...that gave you reason for concern.

You're saying you willed these events to happen?

Norman was telling me the dream house is finally finished.

Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.

Hello?

What?  What are you afraid of?

For scaring you like I did.  When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...

No.

No, I don't.

They're calling me in to work.

What was her major?

Wow.

He was so pissed.

You think he killed her?

Seance.

Nothing's happening.

Are you okay?

Oh God...you knew.

Christ, that's twice in...When did they move in?

Alright.  I can't take the rejection.  I'm going to class.

Excellent.  Couple of Swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell.

It's just she's been the focus for a while.

Wanna fool around?

Did you...

And we moved out here for the quiet.

Claire...

Nothing.  There was...I thought I saw something.

Hi.

What are you doing here?

And he says...you'll fucking love this, he says, "Doctor Spencer, I am a great admirer of your work..."

Did you tell her?

Our house.

From the sun.  It's a reflection on the glass.

I didn't do that.

Dressed?

When you do this, I swear...

Norman...

Are you lonely?

What are you doing out here?

Who did?

Norman, this isn't about you.  This is something that's happening to me.  It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention.  Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not...

...I'm pulling up, Yuri.  I'll see you for dinner.  Sure you won't stay?

Do I have everything?

You shoved me away and ran out to the patio.  I took you home.

Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.

I may have seen her on campus.

It's Madison Fra--

Ow!

I think she's starting to suspect something.

THAT'S NOT TRUE!  You wanted to quit!  And then when you did, you hated me for it... so you gave it all to her.

Stop...

I tried to break it off!

The leaves...

Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.

I'm cooking you dinner.

:What, you're doing Darcy? Since when?

Going away doesn't mean you leave Lasher behind. He was on Rowan's deck - and the plane...  geography seems irrelevant now.

There are two.

With his hands!

You've always said you felt goodness in them - that the witches brought you and Rowan together.  Isn't that right...?  They're reaching out to you, Rowan!

I'll probably be back in a week...but I can't spend Christmas in that house.   you'll check on her - every day...?

Aaron - lieten to me...  It's been Lasher - from the start!

I'm sure he's alright, Bea. They'll find him somewhere.

Down here. darling, we figure: If you're taking a trip to God knows where - might as well have one hell of a going-away party.

I don't have any aunts - and I've never heard of a 'Carlotta' - or, for that matter - a 'Diedre'!  Just who -

My...mother...?

But my mother...  Ellie said she died -

You came.    I'm your Aunt Carlotta, my dear.

You can see well in the dark, Rowan.

Antha...your grandmother...her life ended there, on the stones. Head split open like a melon.

He's shown himself to you... on the deck.  In the storm.

STOP!

Made it...?

A girl...?

you crave what I might show you.  What you can learn.  What I can give you.  So much more than Michael can.

But I could understand. I want to understand!

You mustn't hurt him. Mustn't - mustn't hurt..

Put - him - down!  His - his heart...

I am your son.  I would not wound you. I could not - ever.

They like you ------- kids.

What do you see...?

My uncle.  Graham.  He and my Aunt, Ellie raised me.  He - he - had a stroke-  Just before Ellie died - of cancer. Last year.

I was born, in New Orleans, too-

Christ, Michael - what the hell are we doing...?  We don't even know -

Michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...?

Rowan...?

Go to LAX and get on a flight to New Orleans.  Go to the Ponchartrain Hotel and wait for me.  I'll call you there.

I'll bet she had a wonderful smile.

Everyone - this is Michael curry.

Either do I.    I love you, Ro.  You know that. You're a total mystery to me - but I love YOU. 

Maybe the shrimp you bad last night.

Gee - look at that.  I didn't know alligators came this far up on shore

ROWAN we're below sea level. I've spent time there myself.

Remember the first time we made love - and then ---

You alright...?

I - I...  I can't, Michael.  There's stuff --- at the clinic -

sooner Or later you're gonna run out of things to change.  You always do.

'Leave bees be - and the bees be nice.' Didn't your father ever teach you that...?

He's got great hands.

We'd better get to work on the papers.

That would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash.

OH MY GAWD!

Sounds good - thank you

When could I look round?

All the time?

This must be one of the old keys -

Do you take sugar?

If you want any - there's some left in the kitchen

No - the police say I've killed fourteen - but I've not - I've killed many more. It amazes me how they just haven't found the bodies. What is society coming to when people just don't get missed. I agree, some of them are well hidden - I probably couldn't even show you where I put them - one girl, number eight I think the press called it - she wasn't even mine - I don't know who did it but I didn't

Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You know what I want. - But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight.  The real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. It made such a mess of

The press think that the WHITE ANGEL is a woman - why is that? Do you dress up LESLIE?

Is white an expression of innocence? Do you crave innocence LESLIE?

No...I didn't do it...I wish I had but I didn't. I was beaten to it. STEPHANIE became my mother.

What was your relationship with STEPHANIE?

Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons

ELLEN, would you like a cup - there's plenty in the pot

I don't like sugar

I'm sorry, I couldn't - when is she due?

What's wrong with you?

I want you out now

It did give me a chance to meet you again ELLEN - It's all routine you understand...So where were you?

I'd watch her mate - she has thing for men - they disappear near her.

I'm really very sorry - I was banking on this coming through, because it's only five minutes from my surgery...

Just put it in my room

I'm sorry, I didn't mean to shout...

You're a novelist - why didn't you tell me?

I thought it was you - how are you?

Dead?

Oh no sir - just making some enquiries...Just tell her that INSPECTOR TAYLOR called on you - she'll understand

I shouldn't really - I'm not your surgeon...

Sugar?

Come on, bro. Spare yourself the humiliation, the degradation...

I genuinely think she wants me. I feel a vibe.

The only chick more untouchable than Christy Malone is Miss April.  "Hi, my name's Ginger. I love tofu burgers, rainy nights, and riding bareback.  My biggest turn-off is cell phones during sex." Here's a tip:  set it on VIBRATE, honey, and don't be stingy with the lube.  Don't knock it till you tried it.

Seriously, it's like we're being reborn. We really could reinvent ourselves here, just like you said. Nobody knows about your massive humiliation.

This is the life, baby. We get ourselves some tail and we're talking SPRING BREAK!

I feel like I'm entering a forbidden tomb...

Naked girls, wild sex, video games. No wonder it's called "Heaven."

That explains the emptiness that haunts me.

You go first.

I mean, what do you think?

We can't accept it.  It's much too expensive. Right, dear?

Ted, we put a lot of love in our business.

Grandpa was so strong back then. Working from the crack of dawn. So proud of his peaches.

Son.

I paid off the mortgage! I ordered that Winnebago you always wanted! Now you're ashamed of me?

Teddy, I thought we were having a moment here.

Ted! Do something!

But we did want you. It's just that you don't always get to keep what you want. We knew you needed a real mom and dad.

No problem, consider it done.  I had this idea of shooting on location. Outdoors, you know? Maybe at some famous Xenia landmarks. You think that would be a problem?

They're not my parents, Helen. My parents are back in Xenia and I hurt them very much.

James, what are you doing here?

Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home.

You're a peach.

Let me guess: retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof!

Is it true? Is ignorance bliss?

A few billion bucks and suddenly he's Cro-Magnon Man of the Year.

I guess.

She said peanuts, you cretin.

Considering this is your first time on a private jet, on which you are interviewing the world's most eligible bachelor,  you are extremely cavalier.

Charlie's right. Jealousy is so unattractive.

He cared enough to want you to have it.

I mean my father.

And then what?

You're amazing.

You forget, I dislike YOU at least as much as him.

A good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade. I'm honing my craft.

I don't know. This place seems pretty tame.

Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.

Do you trust me, Julie?

I want you to trust me.

Julie, wow. I was afraid you left. I was afraid I'd never see you again.

The thing is, I'll need a first mate.

That's part of growing up, honey.

Oh, good lord. Are those Neptunes?

Ted, you are the best editor this school paper ever had. You don't need to be pandering flesh. It's nonsense. It's beneath you.

With all due respect to Merk, he doesn't have to read my magazine. But he has no right to stop others.  Ever hear of the First Amendment?

Smashing!  Welcome to the family, Ted. You are going to breathe some new life into this place. You are going to set the world on fire! You are going to...call me Uncle Billy? Please?

You do like girls, don't you?

Ah, in other words, this is the apres-orgy salon?

Maybe she needs help, Ted. You should be a gentleman.

No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.

I never finished school myself. Never had to. My brother built this empire from nothing but his wife's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption. He gave me a cushy job on a silver platter. I never struggled for a second.

The world is a big, beautiful place.  We can open new markets in Africa and Asia.  Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine.

Don't forget to tell them all your qualifications.

Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for everything.

What are you doing?

How you doing, Artie?

Not that I'm going to be much good after last night...

She's going to wash your Jeep?

You look pretty.

How soon can we get something?

Ray.  Stop calling.  I told you the dental records will take time...

No.  Not after that night.  I don't know what happened.  Maybe he caught her with some john... All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... Indian kid named Davy.  Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night.  It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away.  That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette.

You okay?

How are you, Kelly? Would you like to take a break for a minute?

Did you try to fight him?

Try, Kelly.

How long?

I don't know what to say...

I've got that two o'clock in town.

We all have...

Where's the body?

Her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away.  And I found the car at the Miami bus terminal.

Will you do me one favor?

At that point were you able to fight him off?

Not that stuff about her running away, him trying to find her.  That's bullshit.

Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...

I told her I was coming with her.  She nodded, like she understood.  We stood up together.

You guess?  Did he or didn't he?

What did you do then?

Suzie!  Did this man rape you?

He pushed into me... I couldn't stop him... it hurt.

It's those rocks, up there.

I say something funny?

I thought we were goin' to a movie.

I wanna live at the beach someday.

Excuse me?

My friends buy me clothes, so I don't look like trash.

Kelly.  What is it?

Where's the hose?  We can set up.

All right.  I'll have to look for it.

The only way we're gonna blow this now, is if we do it ourselves...

I'm sorry, Kelly.  I'm sorry it had to happen like this.  She was losing it...

I just want my life back...

You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.

Who is it?

I'm placing your daughter under arrest.

Yeah, they're bad for your health.  I'm tryin' to look out for you...

Well, you're half right.  Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.

Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts.  Somebody's got to go.

You, Kelly, Sam.

Get away from me.

Davy.

But she ran away.

Did you become squeamish about these things before or after you bludgeoned little Suzie Toller to death with a wine bottle?  Jesus, man. It couldn't have worked out better. They're convinced Kelly whacked Suzie. I can't talk 'em out of it.  We should be celebrating.  This thing worked out just like you said, only better.

You mean this thing?

I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?

But I..

I was worried about you, Suzie.  I decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up.

I can't, Sandy.  I've got to run.

Sandy... What's up?

Didn't you see her this morning?

You're quite the wordsmith, fiddle boy.  But nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment.

That should put us ahead of the criminals.

So... what happened?

You might have mentioned you had that.

Oh, damn!  That's it.

No record of him.

What is that?

So the idea is if a guy punches me, he really hurts his hand?

Excellent detective work, sir.  You should have the honor of going first.

God in heaven, what is that?!

He's not giving up?

Anyone?

I could get used to this, looking down on people.

My name's Tyler.  Frank Tyler. Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory.  Texas.

Well, sir, you are proving to be one of my more interesting guests.

Just a little insurance... against the unexpected.

Look, I'm Captain James West...

Your private train, sir.

Listen, in two days I'm embarking on a tour of the western territories.  And I want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence.

Good work.  Really.

Where'd he say he was going to do this?

... And do give me some room, Voltaire.  You're breathing on my head!  I hate it when you breath on my head!

These lands were taken by force from Mexico in the illegal War of American Aggression.

I only met him once, but that was enough.  For such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself.  He offered me the "rare and unparalleled opportunity" to develop a new steam engine for him.  He claims to have some sort of factory in Texas, I believe. Said I could have the run of the place.  He had all sorts of specifications.  But when I questioned him closely, it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman.  Both he and his partner had no real love of steam.  It's sad.  So few men do.

Are you all right?

He... he's planning to kill us, isn't he?

We're going into battle, little one.  Find a woman to take care of it.

You left me to die, friend.

The way has been lost in time. But there is one person, a druid sor- ceress, who might guide you there. She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda many years ago.  Her name is Fin Raziel.

Why can't you do it?  You have mag- ical powers.

Gawd...you're...beautiful...

Who is that girl, anyway?

We're a tiny version of all that?

Bavmorda cannot transform you. I've protected this camp with a spell.

Don't make me angry, Peck.

Hey!  Somebody's coming!

Thanks for your help, Peck.

What's that?  I hear something!

Nobody's gonna take your baby. Know why?  Nobody cares...  Except me.  You wanna go back to your farm. You wanna go back to your family. I could take care of that baby. I'll look after her like she was me own.

You gotta promise to feed her.

When I left the crossroads, I got ambushed by an elf!

Madmartigan, I need your help.

She said lots of thing.s

She's a bird, Willow.

I have an idea.  Back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs.

Who are you!  Who are you!

Kill him!

I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self.  But what's this got to do with it?

I'm all finished.  Now what?

We don't have much time left!  Go on!  Go on!

Your will!  Your will!  What else could it be?

Oooh, this smells terrible.

Tir Asleen.

I did it!  Madmartigan!  Come here! Look!  You gotta see this!  I did it!

Get down!  The ritual chant! Quick!  Protect yourself!

Patience, Willow.

She needs to be changed again. Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re- lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror. Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire.

Ohhh, I hate this.

You don't know anything... borrowed your car. Didn't say why. And you never heard of that woman and her boy.

Nail it!

Tell you what  I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand.

Are you really ever coming back?

Amish.

That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.

Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it.

What's your first move?

What was that?

Believe me, I'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can. But Samuel will probably have to come back and testify.

But not a good tired.

Your sister said you don't have a family?

Why don't you arrest that man? Are you protecting him because policeman?

Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.

Enjoying your reading?

Where's the nearest telephone?

The... bullets?

There was a time when I thought you might have stayed.

I'm not so sure of anything as you are, John Book. You could live this life if you wanted to bad enough.  Just as I could live yours!

There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land!

What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven!

Where I'm at is maybe 1890.

You'd lie to protect him.

That has no place in this house.

No, Rachel...

We'll, them Ohio Amish sure must be different.  Our Lancaster brethren, they just don't have that kind of fight in them.

Momma... are they angry with us.

Auntie Em, really -- you know what Miss Gulch said she was gonna do to Toto?  She said she was gonna --

Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!

Look at you, Zeke -- you're just as white --

To see?

If she?

...resourceful!

If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises!

... -- Oz -- has spoken!

Yes-s-s -- that...that's exactly so.  I'm a humbug!

Oh!  Come back!  Don't go without me! Please come back!

I thought you said she was dead.

Pooh -- what a smell of sulphur!  I'm afraid you've made rather a bad enemy of the Wicked Witch of the West.  The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.

...Toto, too?

Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?

That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.

Here!  I've got an order!  Let me have...

...and right in the middle of a chop, I...I rusted solid.  And I've been that way ever since.

Oh! They're - they're gone now.

And I was standing over there rusting for the longest time.

And bears!

Oh, my!

How about a hippopotamus?

Because I'm still scared!

That noise don't come from no ordinary bird.

Oh -- Oh -- Oh!  Toto -- Toto!

...don't talk.

Down?  No, you see, I'm -- Well, -- I'm --

Did I scare you?

I don't blame you for that.

Hooray!  We're off to see a Wizard!

Oh, I'll try!  Really, I will.

Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had!  And it's funny, but I feel as if I've known you all the time.  But I couldn't have, could I?

Yes -- there --

-- A hot water bottle would be good if we had one.

Oh, come on now - everybody -- 

Would...would it do any good if I roared?

Wait a minute, fellahs.  I was just thinkin'.  I really don't want to see the Wizard this much.  I better wait for you outside.

Yes, you.

Up!

Come on -- I've got another idea.

Stop pushing!

Where -- where do we go now?

I haven't slept in weeks.

Whozat?

...the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door!

Beautiful!  What an echo!

That's right.

Oh, this is terrible -- can't budge her an inch!  This is a spell, this is!

Oh, did - did you see that?

Oh, I hate to think of her in there.  We've got to get her out. 

Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Universitatus Committeeatum e plurbis unum, I hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of Th.D.

What happened to Len Tashka?

Shame you had to spot I wasnt the real thing.

The plutonium is missing.  Theyve taken the core!

What the hell were you doing?  You nearly killed us!

Elektra King?  Are you insane?  This is her pipeline.

Do you know what youre doing?

Weve got to get out.

Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...

He survived?

The bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his sense of touch. He feels no pain. He can push himself harder, longer than any normal man.

Not the usual Swiss procedure, Mr. Bond, but you understand, a man in my position..

I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent.

I am just a middle man. I am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner...

Revenge isnt so hard to fathom. Whats clever is getting someone else to pay for it.

Who is it?

A word? Im sure by now hes engineered a hostile takeover.

He was my father.

Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women?

I have to check the upper lines.  Gabor will drive you back.

You dont take no for an answer, do you?

I cant stay.

The way I acted, in the snow...you must think Im a coward.

I dont want to be safe!

Whats wrong with you?  Are you crazy?

Wheres M?

It runs in my veins, thicker than blood. Im going to redraw the map. And when I am through the whole world will know my name, my grandfathers name, the glory of my people.

One... last... screw?

Valentin Zukovsky.

You, of course. I need some information.

I thought you were the one in her business.

Warm.

So beautiful. So smooth, so warm.

The parcels in the post.

Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.

The access code's been changed.  Your card won't work anymore.

As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt.

We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.

The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.

Then why don't you . . . do something about it!

I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to die I want to be with -- other people.

Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter a bit.  I want you to cure me.

You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.

Jon, where are we?

Okay, okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us made other choices.

Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .  How about you, Laurie?

Laurie, wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . . . LAURIE Oh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about --

Eight cops?  Oh, great.  A jury's gonna love that.

I just realized.  I'd never seen his face.  I guess it was just a matter of time.  He's totally -- Daniel? What's wrong?

Enough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we?

I took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some cows.  -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica.

This'd better not be what I think it is.

What the hell -- ?

They're practically on us . . .

What's he doing?

Sure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.

Where's Laurie?

We're running, Rorschach.  We've got no place to go.  We're hightailing it down to Adrian's.

Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.  Sorry about Laurie.

You're not "protecting" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on the answers you give.  These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --

You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.

He's a little farther gone every time.

Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with --

Bigger than I thought.  CTU involved . . .

What is this place?

Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. "Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?

Now I'm the one who's nauseous. So what's the deal? What do you need me for?

What do I get out of it?

How about a pedicure as long as you're down there. What's this? Lo-Jack?

Up yours.

I guess you got my E-mail. I set up a purchase. Ten cars.

This is good work, X, damn fine work. You need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this "Ahab".

Thanks.

They retrofitted Ahab with some kind of rocket launcher. They were loading canisters of liquid into it, light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate. Something tells me this it that "classified" stuff you didn't want me to know about. Does the song "Silent Night" mean anything to you?

Come on, Gibbons, you can do better then that.

Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we came up with?

Kinda funny, though, isn't it? We're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway. Guess we shoulda played by the rules.

How will you fix it?

So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven.

They're degenerates. There's not a man in there that would give a damn if the Chinese took over.

You what? A wire transfer of this size?

We seen this kind of parachutes before, you know. U.S. Army. You got some friends here, jump out with you guys?

What game is that?

Do you know what a wire transfer is?

I don't know what you're talking about.

Go to hell!

There's no more time for games. They made you. There's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. Tell me if it's true.

What's that?

No, I guess I've been no help at all to you.

What are you doing with the Ivans?

No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.

By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!

What was that for?

I think I'll hang on to these.

From the Beastie Boys collection?

French Polynesia? This wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you know how expensive it is down there?

Dude, what are you doing here?

I found something big enough for us to take these guys down with. They've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash.

Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?

To us it means no walls, no speed limits, no jails. It's everybody does what he wants. People think democracy is freedom but they don't have a clue. There's an old punk song. It says: "America stands for freedom, but if you think you're free..."

I've been here before, when I was a kid. My old man was in the service, we used to live on the Army base in Hamburg.

Hell no. My dad was a straight up tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged. Had a court martial and everything. The charges were total bullshit, so he was sure he'd get his name cleared, but it didn't happen.

And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much?

And here I thought "anarchy" was just something cool to put on a Tshirt.

It appears as though Magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings. And he is using Adamantium as its core.

Yes -- Only there's a problem.  The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature.  It's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to.  The Senator's body is literally burning itself out.  Scott -- this machine kills people and I don't think Magneto realizes it.

I'm going to assume that means that the Secret Service is out of commission.  Jean, can you raise me up there?

I'm o.k.  I'm o.k.

I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep.  Even with your healing ability, you're going to be hurting for a while.

I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.

Let go.

He takes himself seriously.

You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --

I do love a good check mate.

Come with me and I'll let her live.

What are you going to do?

Who?

Forty-eight hours, old man.  But if you cross me, I won't feel any guilt about what I do to you.

How?

You designed this yourself?

If I could make you understand.  If you could just be made to see it the way I do.  The way it's going to be.

Doesn't it ever wake you in the middle of the night?  The feeling that some day, some day very soon, they will pass that foolish law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and your children?  Take you all away?

And what do you do when you wake up to that?

What was your grandfather's name?

Give him an extra dollar.

Carlson!

You're incorrigible!... Aren't you?

MMMmm!

Oh, darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away.

Mother's going to help me with the invitations.

I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.

Goodbye, darling.

Darling!

Darling!?!

Are you suggesting I call him master???

Is your room just down the hall? ... in case I get frightened during the night?

That's a tough choice.

I hope you find this comfortable. This was Baron Victor's room.

You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring.  I'll leave it on the table here.

There seem to be quite a few books.

well, there was a public and a private library -- he said so in his will.  these books are all very general -- any doctor might have them in his study.

What?

I didn't do that.

One week at the most!?

No, it's Dr. Fronkonsteen!

Vermicelli.

I see.

No, it's pronounced Aye gor.

There wolf!  There castle!

What a filthy job!

It's always been one of my favorite names.

Throw the third switch!

You'll be getting me sad next.

I'm not that sort you know.  I appreciate you feelings, but try to show them some other way.

To you!  You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.

Better not get too close, master. This guy could kill you.

But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us.  I've got to untie it.

What's the point of my setup? It's not funny unless you repeat exactly what you said.

It seem to have stopped the big fellow in his tracks.

What monster?

Come on, big fellow!

How's everything?

It's alive.  It's -- moving! It's -- breathing!  It's -- standing!  What is your name?

Get the sedative ready!

MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmm.

What's that tune that you're playing

Nice!  Nice little balance to it.

Sometimes I'm afraid of the lightning.

Are you busy?

Oh please -- just till I get sleepy. Then you can force me right back to my room.

Would you like a sandwich?

Inga!

Dr. Fronkonsteen -- look!

Do you think you can sing it?

Just passing through the night.

No, not sound.

I'm getting tired.

Look how far we've come.

Igor -- are you sure the monster has a good brain?  Are you absolutely certain that you took the brain of Hans Delbruck that night?

Oh, must be around ten... ten-thirty.

Yes, sir, name, please?

Foooooood!
