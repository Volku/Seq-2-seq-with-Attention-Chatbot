Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?

You always been this selfish?

I hope so.

Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?

Is he oily or dry?

I don't have to be home 'til two.

My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.

I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.

God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself

So did you

No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.

Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.

And where're you going?

Otherwise known as an orgy?

It's just a party. Daddy.

Just sent 'em through.

Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.

Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.

They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?

I thought you hated those people.

Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.

Yeah -- we'll see.

I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.

So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?

Don't make me do it, man

Sure

She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.

Not at all

How much?

We don't chat.

An attempted slit.

William would never have gone to a state school.

I didn't have a choice.

Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .

Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.

My mission in life.

Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?

Funny, you're the only one

Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.

See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?

Who?

He just wants me to be someone I'm not.

So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?

Something like that

I hate peas.

No what?

So I have to have a motive to be with you?

You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?

It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?

Is that right?

Because I like to torture you.

Enough!

Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.

Right.

What?

The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.

Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.

Yeah.

Touch of the flu.

But -- who -- what --?

Absolutely not.

Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.

What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...

I know.

I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!

Thank God...

Yes... I remember...

I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.

There must be a passage to that other ocean.

I'm not bargaining!

Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.

Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him.  And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.

Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?

I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.

If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...

You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not my horse.

And what do you think Mendez?

You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?

We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time.

No, he is here.  Shit...

What about my movie rights?  Book rights?

Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.

Give me another one, please.

My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.

Your father put cigarettes out on you?

Somewhere else?

No.

So you were never a prostitute?

I'm just trying to find out who you are.

They're not gonna send you right back.

If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away.

C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?

Go on.

A shower!?  Did you take one, too?

What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.

But Chief?  Over this??

Yeah.

You ready?

It's okay.

Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up.

Nah, why should you?

Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?

You were right, they were both dead before the fire.  The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  That's usually an indicator of something personal.

There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.

This isn't homicide school.

I'll call it... tails.

Better than one.

I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already.

I'm on duty.

What would your girlfriend think of that?

So am I.

No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.

You know, I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him.

What's your accomplishment.

Then do it, asshole.

We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.

I can't talk right now.  We have some things to take care of.

Yeah.  Now's not a good time.

Alright?

Alright.

Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?

Answer it.

No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.

I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.

I'm not moody.

That's unique.

I am butcher.

I ordered a Czech girl.  Daphne, you know her?

Yes.

How long are you planning to stay?

We have no money.  Come on.

I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!

Shut up.

Yes.  But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit.

A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!

You spent all the money while I was in prison?  Now you tell me to get a job fixing toilets?!?

I want to hear everything he said.

Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight.

He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in.

I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?

Oh yeah, why?

Yeah?

How long they been livin' here?

Not good.

Your doctor?

And isn't there a movie in the works about you?

Right. Just a sec.

Okay, come on down.

Sure, what is it?

What's up?

Yes?

Yes.

I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.

Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.

I guess it isn't.

No.

I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.

He's got a point.

Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.

I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.

Yes, it is, Hal.

The antenna has to be replaced.

I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.

Well, what is it?

Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?

No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.

In three days, darling, I hope.

Thank you.

I'll bet it's a fortune.

How is gregor?

Please, it really doesn't matter.

You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?

How can you tell it was deliberately buried?

There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.

We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?

Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?

No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.

I will if I can, Frank.

That's true.

No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.

He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what I tell ya, you'll be okay.

Yeah, i been waiting three years.

I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.

Would you guys...

What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...

I don't think you're gonna make it.

I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.

What are you talkin' about?  This suit's mine.  It cost $900.

It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.

I think you better put him on ice, man.

If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?

Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.

Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.

Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?

You need five years training to handle a joint like...

I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.

You catch on real fast...Okay, Jack, let's talk deal. How much of my money you gonna let me keep?

Musta got some primo bondsman.

I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...

If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin', cause I already think he's real dumb.

What about Ganz?

You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.

So you took the rest of the night off...

When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.

I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.

Yeah, too bad.  They were real nice lookin' too...In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching TV...

I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything, I'm gonna know it.

Hey, Jack, real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was fantastic.

Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.

Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth's a little different.

Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.

The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.

Right.  I screwed up.  I fucked up. I messed up.  Anybody could have done better, especially you. I bet you're real good at hitting targets through crowds.

I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.

Yeah.

They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.

Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job.

Hey ... Dick Tracy.

Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?

What?

I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty.

You're hopeless.

What's wrong with that?

I guess he got the message...

Hey, you know what I really think?

What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place?

Jack, are you okay?

Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...

Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...

So what?

Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.

Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.

That's what I always say.

That's no bull.

What do you want?

Alright, I'm coming...hold on.

Can't complain.

Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-

I don't know what you're talkin' about.

You try to mess with us or go to the cops, I promise you, I'll put holes in her you wouldn't believe.

I'm sure.  Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.

It's loaded... I got some shells in here.

I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.

Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.

I brought the girl remember?

I know. I was there when she arrived.

Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.

Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!

Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.

I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!

They are... with me...

Leeloo..

...'Scuse me?

Vito Cornelius?

...Leeloo.

Take them and put them in a safe place.

I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?

Have you pulled yourself together?

You little sleaze bag!

Don't you ever ask me for another thing in my life again, you've killed your poor mother with your own hands!

How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK? I didn't.

I had the worst goddamn nightmare.

He's on vacation.

Fuck it! Hold tight!

Yeah... then I sighed... like this.

Just one... why me?

Why not?

Three of us will never fit in there!

Uh..you're welcome.

...Hoppi-hoppa.

The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long.

...The rain falls...

Because...

Wonderful!

Options.

Gentlemen?

Only too well... here you must be parched..

Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled.

Do you know how much I missed you?

We've been all through that.  I've been on my best behavior.

Sure.  I'll call the guy.

What's wrong?  Are you alright?

I don't know.  I'm sorry...

Don't...

Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films. Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free.

The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...

Is it?

I'd rather you didn't.

Machine's in?

Brooklyn.  Don't be late.

What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...

Why don't they come to me?

Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.

You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?

Don't bore me with that bullshit.

Fuck you!

I told you, I don't know.

Yeah.

Why?

You enjoy it?

Stop talking.

Don't think I won't.

Of what sort?

Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.

That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.

They're no friends of mine.

Shut up.

Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?

Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?

I'll risk it.

Max.

You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.

Four hundred a week, off the books.

Sounds good, pops.

Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...

See ya.

It's their Presidential Suite.

Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?

"Devil" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite.

Nope.

He's a lawyer.  Please, sit, here...

Do you want to tell me what you found?

The checks were for odd amounts...

Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?

You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.

Okay.

No.  You don't have any reason to think that...

That's her suitcase.  I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.

She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?

It was bad.

Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.

You could do worse.

Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.

We have matching luggage.

You're his sister, right?

The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.

Why can't we just talk to the authorities?

Then what else can we do?

Who?

Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.

Earth to Alice...

Now it gets weird.  She says he comes back in dreams.  If he kills you there, you're dead for real.

Your distraught.  It'll help...

Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!

Mother, you've just murdered me.  Take that to your goddamn therapy...

Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?

It's okay, Dan

My friend, with the funny hand.

He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people.

Alice...

No, I'm not.  I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.

I've got to go.

But Dad --

There aren't any little boys on your floor.

They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.

No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.

I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.

Krueger is reality.

What do you think I'm doing?  Look.  Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back.  He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??

That's the only reason you're alive...

So did Dan.

She must've fallen asleep at the table...

That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.

No shit.

You know my mother -- get real.  What about Alice's?

Yeah...

Mark...

Stick around, please?

We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!

You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?

You may not <u>win</u> them.  But without men like your father, to 'degrade' himself by fighting to preserve them - or as much as we have of them - they'd have disappeared, <u>long</u> ago!

Huh?

So?

Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?

Sounds like it!  Distress call, from a small freighter, between Ellesmere Island and Greenland. One mayday, then...nothing.

'Us?'

Not <u>alone</u>, you're not!

I...don't know!

Speed...about twenty-two knots. Course...due north!

Wonderful!

Under <u>water</u>?

As ready as we <u>can</u> be!  I'll report to the Skipper.

Who with?

Huh?

After torpedo room:  Report!

That's what I said!

What?

- for horrors like yourself?

Obviously.

The pattern.  Each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the Pole.  A line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle...

Toward the Pole!

All right - go to it.

Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.

About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?

Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.

Yeah. I know about that.

He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.

Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.

That was me.

Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.

Hmm.

Sun's gettin high.

Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?

Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.

Piece of fucking cake.

Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.

What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.

I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow.

Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.

Do what?

I guess they're stupid.

No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?

No.

I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.

That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here.

Grandpa. My father. It's his.

No.

Nothing.

Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight.

I figured you already heard.

You mean Twombley?

You want me to follow them to Littleton?

It ain't done, if that's what you mean.

Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.

What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?

Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?

Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.

Okay. She's fine.

Said what?

Forget it.

I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?

The hell she isn't. Lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day I met her. I'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing, this divorce thing, rearranged. I've been thinking about it a lot. It's like she owns Jill or something. Nobody owns nobody, especially not kids. And I pay her.

I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.

Jack doesn't need money.

It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?

Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?

It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.

Look, that's temporary, believe me. There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit.

Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.

There's a furnace.

I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?

Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.

You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know.

Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.

This town sucks.

No, I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting.  I gotta go.

Nothing.

Sleeping.

From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?

We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?

Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.

They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body.

Huh?

Yeah, I guess.

No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit.

I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.

Yeah.

We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.

For what?

I'm sure he's busy.

Big secret.  You said the same thing to Newsweek.

Yes dear?

You must be tired. It'll wake you up.

You are a resilient man, Mr.

It was the experience of a lifetime.

They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.

Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.

cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.

I'm doing what I can.

Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?

That kid's name was Jim Marshall.

This doesn't make sense.

Like any good poker player, they're checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard.

Sir, this plane carries the President of the United States.

Dead.

Come on, Alice.

I know he left you behind.

Yes

That was war.

Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.

They've gotta be joking.

Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.

Yes, sir.

Can't it wait?

I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.

Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?

This is the President.

You don't understand. This is an emergency. Let me talk to anyone.

I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.

Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging.

That's my job.

Yes, sir.

They better. Fuel's almost gone.

DO YOU SEE TEEM?

Accelerators down.

You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine!  It's all here in the design specifications!  Look!  It's all here!

Goodbye, Ted.  I don't want to hurt you.

Not now, Elaine!

Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.

Ted, please be careful.

The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds.  He'll roast like a pig on a spit.

Maybe.

Yes, sir.

Negative.

It's going to be terrific.  A whole new world, new kids to play with.

I don't want to hear that word!

Have you tried it with a little cinnamon?

Yes.

Now he's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury.

Don't try to stop me!

Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.

I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.

Then Elaine was right.

Pull yourself together!  We've got to...

We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.

People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.

Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.

Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?

Certainly.

He had fish.

I think you ought to know what our chances are. The life of everyone on board depends on just one thing: finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane, but who didn't have fish for dinner.

It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!

My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.

I remember everything. All I have are memories.

That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.

Headquarters!? What is it?

Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.

And a little ice.

Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.

Watch your altitude, Striker. It's too erratic. You can't come straight in. You've got enough fuel left for two hours flying. You've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather.

Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.

What is it?

No, why don't you take care ot it?

Does that cost extra or you throw them in?

That's right.

The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.

You ever try to make a case in Slagtown?  The list of Newcomer informants is about as long as the list of Mexican war heroes...

You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.

I am George.

My true name is Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'.

There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.

And that fits?

So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery.  I'd say that "possible" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.  Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night.

My partner is dead!  Because one of you bastards killed him -- then disappeared into a rathole down in Slagtown, where he's home and dry, 'cause nobody sees nothing, nobody says nothing...

In the camps, we were lodged four to a room.  The selection process was entirely random.  We did not get to stay with our friends... or families...

My wife?  She worries about me.

In the other man's rectum.

Ta ss'trakyona'...

No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.

Thank you.

We all did.

Ss-ai!

Do what?!  George-- ?!

No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on the drug.  Massive amounts trigger a... a change.  Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation.  When you emerge you're...

We can't let him get away.

Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.

You understand that.  But how many others will?

We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?

Who else can I ask around here?

... They took the stuff out, all of it -- this afternoon.

Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters.

Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.

Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!

Let's go.  Pull 'em out.

Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those...

Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course.

Well, thanks, I --

Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest...

Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...

Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?

If you go.  It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse...

Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.

But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --

You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.

PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.

Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?

...We're coming in.

About seventeen days.

But they don't know that.  They're probably looking for other ways to get in.  That'll take them awhile.

Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.

We ain't going anywhere.

Hudson, give us a break.

You're just reading me.

How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.

Just get back here!

Terrible.

What about me?

You promise?

Why do they tell little kids that?

Did one of those things grow inside her?

I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.

I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!

At present the girls only peck me. Their cruelty surely will wreck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown! At present the girls only peck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown. Up to heaven be flown! Up to heaven be flown!

His Grace is very angry with you.

Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?

What?

Well, what does it matter to you?

I'm so relieved.

What??

Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night, Signore.

Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.

Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.

Who the devil are you? What do you want?

Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height.

Oh shut up. I'm sick to death of that tune.

Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.

Why? People fart backwards.

Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!

No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!

No, this is serious. Say it backwards.

Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!

Of course.

They'll come anyway. They love me here.

Oh yes? You always know everything.

Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.

Wolfi.

Wolfi! Your father is dead.

Your father is dead.

Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!

It's killing me.

That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.

No, sir. This is my own idea.

Sir, we really need this job. We're desperate. My husband spends far more than he can ever earn. I don't mean he's lazy - he's not at all - he works all day long. It's just! he's not practical. Money simply slips through his fingers, it's really ridiculous, Your Excellency. I know you help musicians. You're famous for it. Give him just this one post. We'd be forever indebted!

Tonight?

What for?

But! I'm a married woman!

Not at all.

He's doing his best.

Adorable!

Hey!

I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.

Gertrude!

Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn.

Your Highness.

Yes?

Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.

Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!

Twenty-six.

What is it?

Ah! By all means.

I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.

Don't you have a maid?

How is your financial situation?

Why not? Oh, come, Papa! What better way could I spend it than on you? My kissable, missable, suddenly visible Papa!

I never saw this girl in my life.  Is this a kind of joke?

Papa!

No one calls you that.

Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room.

I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.

Why not?

And which one of them do you want me to teach?

Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose.  How long have you been playing, Fraulein?

Ah!

Filled? That's impossible! They haven't even seen my work. I need this post. Please, can't you help me? Please!

Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.

Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!

Oh no! My wife took it out in time.

Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon.

Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa.

This is only a vaudeville.

The man. He's here.

Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?

Of course.

What?

What time?

You go fast!

What for?

I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately.

But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.

Taking out what you should never have put in.

What is what?

Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.

Mozart -

Why not? It's charming. I mean, I don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! It's not indecent!  It's highly moral, Majesty. It's full of proper German virtues. I swear it. Absolutely!

Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?

In the sight of God that is a sin.

I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.

Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.

And do they believe it?

He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered.

Did you try?

God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know.

About the ballet.

Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?

Did we?

Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.

Excuse me, my dear.

I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.

Miss Gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital.

Dr. Hirsch?

He said 'Jack'.

Yes, I believe he did.

At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...

Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?

Has his friend appeared to him again?

Warn him?

David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?

What?

I'm not very hungry, thank you.

Leave the pills. I'll take them later.

Shall I be forced to feed you, David?

Will you give me a break?

'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.

I dream of death mostly.

No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.

I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.

Will you think about it?

I'll let you know the next full moon.

Your dead friend Jack?

Charming.

Do me an enormous favor?

The zoo?

Don't you remember?

Rational!?! I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake!

Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.

You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.

This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.

Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.

You really think I'm crazy, don't you?

David.

I don't know.

We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?

Wrong.

You ask them.

I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.

Pecos Bill.

Walk away, Jack.

I'll tell you when we get there.

Are you going to help me up?

This is too much. I can't handle this.

Rudy Levine the shmuck?

David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you.

We were attacked by a werewolf.

On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.

I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.

The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.

What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!

Jack, please go away. Please go away.

I wanted to see you.

You must believe me.

You don't have to say anything.

If I was still alive, I probably would.

Roger Mathison, Doctor.

Campari and soda would do nicely.

Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting that David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock.

That is precisely my point. David, as far as we are concerned, the matter is closed. We won't trouble you any further. Good day.

The detectives got Matt up there in Sampson's office.

It was more than that last week.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yes, sir.

Oh, is he? We carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city. We're fools to tolerate it.

I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind.

I know, Dickson. That's all very well. But you're taking too many chances. In these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble. In case of emergency!

What about?

Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?

You understand?

But I didn't kill that man last night. Honest I didn't, Mr. Dickson!

Get out, get out!

Why not?

All you gotta do is fix a few things for us , and we'll do the rest, see?

Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason why I should be, unless of course it's you . . .

Well, you can. You always could.

Well, aren't you going to invite me?

Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway.

Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?

Oh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.

No?  Then maybe you'll understand, Mrs. Dickson. Oh, gee, he's crazy about you. Nobody knows it better than you. If he ever finds out, it'll kill him.

This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me.  What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?

Hello, darling.

But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.

You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn

Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.

Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married?

Now don't you worry about it.

Yes, sir.

Yes?

Good morning, Mr. Dickson.

Yes, thank you.

I haven't any.

No, sir.

Why, I don't know.

There you are.

Were you in Cluett's apartment?

She was, wasn't she? How long has this been going on? Do you know?

But I haven't . . .

I'm afraid he's been stalling.

He says he can't get away in the daytime.

What are you talking about?

Mine too?

Is it safe?

It's his life insurance money, you know.

Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless!  If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?

Oh, is that so?

Yeah.

I tell you, I saw them!

Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.

All right, dear.

Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.

Yeah.  I got an idea. Come on, let's get to a telephone.

Mr. Williams . . .

Yes, why?

He was here?

I've been trailing the cashier like you told me. You're right about that guy, chief. There's something screwy somewhere.

Sure I do. He has the best room in me house. The one with the fancy wallpaper.

Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after

Yes.

Yeah, what did he do with his first one?

Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.

Nope.

They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --

One false move and I'll blow your heads off!

What?

Tell me.

What's going on?

I could use the walk.

It was exciting.

Sorry.

If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.

Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --

That's it.

Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!

Pass me some whisky.

Shakespeare.  He's European.

Yeah, Injun. What do you want?

What is it?

So?

My little Web did that?

Go home, Doc.  They ain't gonna hang no more Liberty boys.

Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here.  But out.

I think he's already feeling better.

Mm-hmm.

What worries me is that Jesus is talking back.

Your Zee? Hmm.  "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive: they sparkle still the right Promethean fire; They are the books, the arts, the academes, that show, contain, and nourish all the world."

And that's why you both lead the gang. Two of you went into that bank together, right?

If I could go back to farming --

I know. But that's how it should have ended. Your Dad and Mom, riding off into a new life, growing old together, happy.

They're making him a hero now.

But he killed a lot of men, too.

We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.

Mmmm.

Nuh-huh ...

What?

I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.

And what's this right girl like?

Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems you're trying to quote?

I'll explain on the way.

Not that day. I am guilty of many things, but that was Mr. Thaddeus Rains and Parker, that day.

Last February?

The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town.

You don't think God'll mind, do you?

Thank you.

No.

Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.

Tonight? Why, I'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm.

I think so.

I hope I'm not being too forward.

I just though you were awful cute.

They donate money to farmers, to churches. Rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of Maddox so much money they were able to build a school.

Move you fools!

And it is my pleasure to be here.

NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!

A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.

I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.

In English, Pinkerton.

Vengeance.

Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.

Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?

Pumpkin?

Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.

Yes.

Mmmm...thanks, Patrick.

Turn the light on.

Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.

Maybe.

Yes, Courtney?

Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.

Alright.

No-I can't take the time off work.

Everybody's rich.

It's not.

What are the rules for a sweater vest?

Good coloring.

Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about fucking dinner?"

But wait, Harold, what do you mean?

Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let alone...what was it you said he did to her?

No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.

Jesus lives, Luis.

Patrick?

Calm down. Let's do it anyway

But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.

Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.

I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!

Negative. Cancel it.

Yes, sir.

Come on, you're prettier than that.

Patrick, I think he knows you're here. It's only ten-thirty.

Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please. She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.

No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.

Well, I'd like to travel. And maybe go back to school, but I really don't know...I'm at a point in my life where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I'm so... I don't know...unsure.

No, not really.

Growing. I'm glad you said that.

Who's Ted Bundy?

Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?

No. I really don't.

Oh, can't, I'm afraid. Matinée of Les Miserables. Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call you.

You're at Paul Owen s.

Patrick, you re a lunatic.

No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?

You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?

No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  Was that anything important?

I think his family wants this kept quiet.

Shoot.

Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.

I know. I'm sorry.

Hang...out?

No, he just hung out there.

I just wanted to know if you know. BATEMAN Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's... Listen, I just...I just want to help.

But...has anyone seen him in London?

Oh.

People just...disappear.

Eerie. Really eerie.

Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think?

That's not the information I've received.

Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?

Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.

Not in the mood, I guess.

But how? Where do you place Paul that night?

I'm hungry.

Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.

It's...it's...all right.

We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.

Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?

What shit? Now where do we have reservations at? I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have reservations somewhere.

'Gonna wait outside.

But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high?

Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?

"Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about.

I went to see the Skywire model in Gary's office. You know. Just to hold it again.

Great.

Prick.

Give me two seconds with Lacy here?  Go on in, I won't be a moment.

Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.

Yes sir.

That'd change with a criminal indictment.

He just likes to write code. He's bummed there's so much secrecy and competition, everybody trying to own everything.

Definitely.

...Worse?

'Sorry about the late notice...

I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But it's meant a lot more.

Keep looking.

They know. 'Just they don't trust me with it. So we'll get the evidence, first, ask questions later.

I launched Skywire. Just pray the last set of coordinates Milo sent me connected us to Gary's satellite.

I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.

Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick.

But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --

Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake in Gary's set-top device. That also takes out CNN.  "GE joins Outpost in new venture," which means NBC is out. "Disney joins Outpost," ABC is out. "Outpost and Newscorp in new deal," Fox is out. Any of these places could have a mole. Or all of 'em.  It's like a a continuous loop. We can go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read, get them and us killed. But anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something Gary's got a finger in!

A what?

'Cause their apartments might be bugged?

Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.

Perfect.  How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to --

At this point the worst thing I could do is anything out of the ordinary.

What?!

No! I keep thinking it'll go away. But there's this -- connection. She's been hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot. Plus I see her every day, we're working on the same program. She's -- beautiful.

What does that mean?

His Snapples were in alphabetical order.

You wanna survive in the software business, you cover your bets... I gotta say, this is the weirdest car anybody ever requested.

Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?

Speaking of which...

Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.

Unless it's a diversion. Milo's in my office. He was tailgating, so I --

Groovy.

Or sometimes not at all.

Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.

Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?

Smashing!

Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good.

Oh, and Austin...

You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence.

We won, Austin.

Yes?

Right away, Exposition.

Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.

Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.

Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development.

Hey, Mick!

Excuse me?

A Chigro?

What?

Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone, an on-board computer, and a Global Geosynchronous Positioning Device. Oh, and finally, this.

I'm sure.

Why?

Let me see.

He's too well-protected right now.

Well, you know... cows, and shagging.

No worries, luv. We'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...

You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa.

No, this is me in a nutshell.

Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.

Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.

Only sailors use condoms, man.

Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.

Do you think she's prettier than I?

You know who.

Hey, wait a minute--

Hey! Wait a minute, that's my last piece of gum.

Can't you see I'm only half a man? Look at me, I'm a freak!

Right. Okay. Moving on.

Sea bass.

Not me.

You always do that!  Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil.

Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.

Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?

I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.

I don't want to.

Oh, really?  One-hundred billion dollars.  OK, make it happen. Anything else?

Great.

Just wait. Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out.

I don't wanna take over the family business.

No, he's really evil.

OK, Scott, no one really wants to "kill" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it.

There are limits?

... head ...

Black...

Love...

... love ...

You don't get rain like you used to in England. A good shower that's the ticket. Stiffens resolve, puckers the spirit, quells the namby-pamby in a man.

Out in India. So character-forming for the British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen inches overnight. A whole week of lovely rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ...

Have we met?

Sir August...?  What now?

Rules are made to be broken.

Let me guess -- 'Father'?

Next assignment?

Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...

But -- why?

One very small thing. A diamond 'cyclone' chip. A thousand times more information on a fraction of the size. If I possess that, my powers would be unlimited. My dear half-brother was developing it. But he suspected sabotage. He gave the chip to ... you, 'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But also your ring.

Mother?

Really?  I fail to see the connection.

Do you really think so?

Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you.

They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.

I meant me.

Any other vices?

Small talk.  Try the weather.

I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought you were just overdressed.

Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel.

Thanks ...  I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello?

Is there anything that isn't?

Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?

Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.

According to Dr. Darling, you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression, leading to outbursts of anti-social and violent behavior.  Q.E.D.

Have I trespassed on a male prerogative?  We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ...

... when I don't. It comes down to one thing, Mrs. Peel. Trust.

You lied.

No idea who. No idea why ...

... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.

Not to speak of. Peter and I were both loners. There was nobody.

You first.

'The Merry Widow?' I might have known. Where's the reception?

'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'

Peter's brother?  But --

I fail to see --

How did you guess?

She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.

You're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. Weather's turning very nasty -- and so am I.

She was ...

This way ...

Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...

Walk over to the window ...

Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.

Check out the other guy's buns.

He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.

They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.

I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car.

I feel like I'm spying on Rick.

Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.

Rick's got an important announcement to make.

When do the girls get to the party?

Bond... James Bond.

Oh, come on, just a little.

The best.

Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?

1002.

Yes, sir.

Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?

You're going to have a bachelor party?

It looks awful.

I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.

C'mere.

Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.

Did I promise that? I don't remember that...

C'mon, I knew it was you.

Yeah.

I know what I'm doing... Go!

Great, Mom.

My pleasure, Al... Always happy to help out in a pinch...  Excuse me. I better call my service... tell them where I am.

Let's see your bread.

They left an hour ago, pink nuts.

Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.

Let's have a toast.

Yes.

I want women.

Larry, you and your wife got problems?

That's it.

Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.

I'm trying to slash my wrists.

I couldn't find any razor blades.

Ha, ha, ha.

Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.

She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce.

Knowing Larry, he probably missed the flight.

Still drawing a blank.

Very.

Who?

My Debbie?

You got it.

Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.

Right. Give me the will to live. Let me go first.

Tim, fill out the alarm card.  Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose.

We're gonna be okay, man...

Let me take the lead, Stephen...

That was an accident! Jesus Christ, why did you have to go in there so fucking early? Why didn't you listen to me!

-- What he would do to your dad's department? You gotta let me finish it --

Not likely.

Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.

I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother "you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed" games?

I'm in heaven, Lt.

-- Never mind.

C'mon, let's crawl home.

He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him.

I know.

I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me.

Shut up!

"You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"

Jennifer.

Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today.

How's it going?

Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?

Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?

Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.

Yeah? And just how much of all this has been "doing your job"?

-- I work for the city.

Your boss is lying, Jennifer.

Just take it.

That's a dumb thing to say.

Who's doing this?

I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.

After it took your dad... the fire... did it look at you Brian? Did it talk to you?...

Your Dennis' kid.  I work alone.

"During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium".

But the right guess on this is arson.

That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience?

Are you going public with this?

Who all ended up wearing candles for faces...  Swayzak's up to his ass in this somehow. Guy can barely hold a drink in his hand, he's so scared.

I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close...  We're not looking in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place...

I know, I know, Should'a called. I've been really busy. I joined the fire department.

Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.

Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.

You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile.

Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.

Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office. They loved it. And you know what? You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight.

What the hell are we waiting for?

Engine 115, right?

"Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, on his very first fire, showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double-check a burning floor alone, emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company... McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father's death..."

It's in my blood, Willy.

Management were pin heads.

Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd you grow up, a barn?

Call in another alarm. We're gonna need some back-up.

I'm busy.

Fixing my roof.

He's got piano lessons.

He deserved it. He was born deserving it.

-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...

McCaffrey, hold this for us.

Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.

You like everybody, Ronald.

I deal with this stuff every day. But a fireman... you never get used to it.  What happened up there? He was a candidate. Did he pay attention? Was he listening?

I might.

Investigator Rimgale.

Who said anything about the fucking street. I've got more connects than you have, Lieutenant...

Yeah.

Nah...

Who?

"The Strawberries"?

I'm a Catholic.

Yes.

I was gonna bring it back myself.

Very good. Very good. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.

Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.

Please. Please don't forgive me. I've always hated you for that.

All right, cop. I want my money.

What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?

Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole, man. I'm a fucking cop!

Yeah, sucker. You better be there!

How about 7 1/2?

I've been dodging bullets since I was fourteen. No one can kill me. I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking Catholic.

I think of running for help, and falling to my knees in prayer.

You knew them?  Who were they, Sister? Who are these boys? What are the names of these -- good boys you knew?

Did he gots to be.

Ho!

Yeah!

Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You must be smoking.  Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?

Please.

What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.

There is a name, a term for your kind, the likes of you.  Back in slavery days, you would be classified as a house nigga.

What do I do?

You might be right.

Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual.

Naw, just jokin'.  That's you. That's you.

What are you talkin' about?

Damn skippy.

Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.

You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me.

We might need some mo' money behind this.

Did we get our bill yet?

Are you crazy?  The joint is crawling with cops now.  You wanna go to Rikers?  Go to the hoosegow?

DeLa, I don't know 'bout this.

Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan.  Believe me, it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her, just lookin' out for a brother.  I feel you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work.  You gotta be professional.

No costume.  No blackface.

Yes.  And I say yes because who is to judge?  Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not?  Who?  Who can play God?

Don't you people get it?  We're in the 21st Century.  Slavery was over four hundred years ago.  All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over.  Folks always crying, white man this, white man that.  Let's all grow up.

I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.

...to white?  I still feel all of my scripts would make good shows.

It's right and tight.  Good morning, let me introduce you to everybody. You know my assistant, Sloan.

Who are the other characters?

We think so.

I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.

No!!!  Just meet the guy.  That's all I'm asking.  Look, I'll even let you choose your own musical director.  You can have that.

Dunwitty, don't leave.

We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.

The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier.  From the gitgo, from jump street.

Pleased to meet you.

How did you end up here?

Where do you go from here?

I didn't mean that, in life.

Manray!

It hit me like a ton of bricks.

Good.  I'm going to need your support.

Manray better not be bleeding to death.  I need him.  After we're done he can do whatever he wants to do, until then, he's ours.

It was the principle.  Dunwitty had to be enlightened.  I was making a point.  I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money.

I'm gonna slit my wrists.  Cut my throat.  For the love of Joseph.

This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.

I don't want to hear it.

I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.

Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.

No.

Yeah.

If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.

I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.

Yes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy called?

My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?

First, I would like to say I love the show.  It's very courageous. My parents marched in Selma, Alabama with Dr. King.

This show was created, conceived by you, a non-threatening African- American male.  Voila.  End of argument.  It can't be racist because you're black.

A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies.

Tavis, thank you for having me.

You tellin' the truth.

The one with da big...

Oh her.

No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.

That's what I like about you and me. We git along...

You slept too near where you got in?

Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.

Maybe I need to do a lot of things.

Y'know what?

After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant.

And what?

Say what, Manray?

The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.

It was my joke.  I was tired, and did not care to go farther.  There's not prettier woman here than that. If she won't suit your fancy, my friend, then you must wait awhile.

And his baggage?

The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that?

It must have been some other gate.

You are going to drive to the frontier.

Your honor must lower his voice.

The gentleman has nothing contraband.

Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.

Only the agency of servants.

Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.

Make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, I warrant you.  Do take a last look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in Berlin.  The dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country, and, out of it, you shall go.

But, for a time... a passing fancy?

I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.

It is my only object.

Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent.

Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.

Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you!  Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? Ever so angry, but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side?  Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From the first moment I saw you, I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving you.  I married you, though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so, and in spite of reason and duty.  What sacrifice do you want from me?  I am ready to make any, so you will but love me, or, if not, that at least, you will gently us me.

With pleasure at finding the ribbon.

Well, sir, this nobleman is one of the gentlemen of His Majesty's closet, and one with whom our revered monarch is on terms of considerable intimacy.  I should say you would be wise to fix upon this nobleman your chief reliance for the advancement of your claim to the Viscounty which you propose to get.

Now, just have a little patience, my boy.  Your birthday isn't until next week.

Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?

Is he all right, papa?

Brooksy was better than you, papa, he used not to swear so, and he taught me many good things while you were away.

Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?

Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.

You know that was like a quadruple negative?

Yeah, and I could've used the sleep. I'm supposed to meet people here tonight, try and get some work going.

Who?

I'm -- I'm sorry...

What do we do?

None of that matters now. We got two dead bodies and a story that explains them. You're either with us, or against us -- which is it?

We found him like this --

What do you mean, alone?

We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. That's the story.

I'm not telling you what happened.

But not Pike's.

You wanna bet?

No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit. Making it through was kind of an honor. Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight, Command would consider you at the top of the class.

Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.

No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?

One went off, yeah, but it didn't touch him -- I thought you knew this --

We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --

Sir, Dunbar, sir!

Sir, yes, sir!

Your weapons, Sergeant.

West... he's dead.

West's. Any kindling for afire?

Oh, come on --

I didn't kill him --

But you didn't.

Well?

Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way --

And here you are going out of house. How's that make you feel, Jules?

And the problem is you only got three.

I'm not gonna let that happen.

There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.

Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.

Does Osborne agree?

That's horseshit and you know it.

I'm not even going to dignify that --

You and the Colonel go back.

You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.

I lied. Wait for it...

I don't think that has anything to do with --

Well, I'm sure if he'd known this was all going to happen he'd have tried harder to witness it for you --

Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that.  We can do this, Hardy.

What?

Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --

And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.

Positive. Hardy, they planned this.

It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add up. Plus, I got kicked out.

Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.  I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?

Hardy, for Chrissakes --

Tough.

Think it'll work?

I should probably write that down.

In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.

Although that won't matter much when coupled with the murder charge --

The faggot speaks.

Oh, you remember now --

He wanted more than that.

Because he'd shot Mueller.

We've been making progress, I see.

No, but it got you interested, didn't it? Got you to dig. Inspired Ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they didn't belong.

It will and you know why? Because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the United States Army; you have no identity, no Miranda warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you, I'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off!

Wait --

Where's your shirt, Mueller?

-- failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself --

No --

We know.

Fine, I will.

Don.

Was she nekkid?

You're pretty good at arithmetic.

I promise. Someday. When I'm really supposed to.

Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.

You're lucky to get four words out of them in English. But if you were to walk through the jungle, you'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French. Those parrots talk about everything: politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion.

I was dreaming.

No, I understand.

Stop.

You were talking about your wedding.

I can.

What's your name, Giant?

That poet, Norther Winslow did. He was going to Paris, France. He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again.  Tell you what. You take the other way and I'll cut through here. Meet you on the far side.

So how does it happen?

Okay.

Really.

It would kill you, huh?

Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.

But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you.

They're your favorite flower.

I called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way I could get my wife to marry me.

I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas.

Hello.

I need to lie down for a bit.

I am always on your side. And I think you should talk to him.

He's up with your father.

Of course.

But I understand you, Mom. I always have.

He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.

Yes?

I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.

I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.

Do you want to stop?

Name it.

What are you doing here?

Ch...

Uh... Yes.

Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?

What are you doing here?

Oh.  We are Russian.

Toast first then we talk seriously, I can see you are serious about us.

Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.

What?

Fine. I thought you were leaving today.

You can stay tonight.

John.

I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.

Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

You don't understand anything.

I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.

No I don't.

No you're not. How... Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ?

I don't have any money.

Okay we won't talk about it.

Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.

And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.

Sometimes.

There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.

Why?

Please, there's no... Oh.

Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.

No.

What?

I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.

Except for Small Eyes.

Whatever.

It's not mine either.

I'm not asking you to marry me.

Yeah, I know.

Been on the crop. May need to get some extra hands if I don't want to work on Sundays.

That'd be nice.

Come on, just a little somethin'. Right here. Go'on now, don't be shy.

Hey. You wasn't at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address. Hope you don't mind me comin' over.

Wanna get on somebody 'bout live music, get on ol' Laz, there. He the one got this place shakin' back in the day.

Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin.  This one's my favorite. It's called Ginger Souffle. I recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. So... perhaps just after a shower.

Yeah.

Sure.

She ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off?

Make yourself at home. You done it already.

You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you?

I begged him. Don't see why he had to go...

It gets worse there. Leavin' me to my own mind. That's just not good.

Yeah.

And you gonna live it with him?

Rose... please...

Let go of my arm...

You sayin' you'll do what?

BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT ME!  You need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason.  You know she been here with me, don't cha? Been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own.

Put all your love and dreams into one woman... she turn around and give it all to another man. That's a good reason to paint the wall with me, kid. She'd fear ya then. Cuz there won't be no more question in her mind. She with a real man now. A real KILLER!

Come on, gal...

Best try gettin' ya wits about you 'fore you try to...

Well I'm woke now... you can take this off.

What do you want?

WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!  WHATEVER YOU GONNA DO TO ME, JUST DO IT! AND LET ME GO!

In my house, you watch that lip...

Uh-uh.

We drinkin' buddies now?

No joke.

You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.

Right here. Be here all afternoon.  You ready for this?

Yeah, gal I been here before.

Woke up real early. Sun was shining. Just thought I'd mess around, try to learn a song.

No, you do it. I can't sing.

What I love.

I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow.

Been years since I fooled with that.  You know a white girl? Dirty blond hair, split down the middle like?

She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?

What'chu sayin'?

Nuh-uh.

Or what?

Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.

I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I found her beat. Left for dead. So I brung her home.

One thing at a time, Laz.

Y'all let me know if these steaks are too dry.

I'm dealin' with what God put before me.

Get me ten bags of mulch.

That's right.

You feelin' sick?

Yeah, I know.

Are you wasted?

All them people shoutin' your name like they were doing tonight! Shit! That arm you got'll get'chu on a box of cereal...

Ronnie. Please, baby...

Thought you had a man for that.

The hell you call me?

-- Cavello.  Ronnie Cavello.

The Wolf?

Saving your life.

Where is the subway station, please.

Number five with a bullet.

I didn't know.

You said that in the last two places.

I'd feel better if we had some heat.

Sure, a rice burning crotch rocket...

Give me a break, would you?

I wasn't expecting you.

Only one way to find out... Get her up in the morning and put her to bed at night.

No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!

Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere...

You were too far behind.

We're through.  I mean it.  This is the end of the line, Matsumoto.

A few minutes faster, we might've nailed him.

Big enough.

Let's go.  Him first.

Kampai.

Why's that?

We can't lose.

Gaiijin?

Maybe I'm a quicker learner.

Sure, but then I just pull out the photos.

You could fake it.

Who am I supposed to be?

Why would you care?

I'm amused.

Yeah.

What...?  What if I say no?

Incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms, carrying official documents.

Look.

I have to get to Sugai.

I want him.

You certainly have a nice place here.

Where?

Can the maker repair what he makes?

Come here.

If it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be...

Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to.

Tomorrow, he says.

If you hurry you'll get back before it gets cold.  I got a spinner on your roof in five minutes.  Good luck.

Then let her get away.  I thought you were a pro -- you're supposed to be a fuckin' tracker!

Yeah.

Soon as I finish the job.

Day after tomorrow.

Why, yes, of course.

Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run,

I know all that.

And what in your estimation works?

Nexus designated Pris:  incept data December 13 2017, competitive, programmed to provide pleasure for long term spacers.

Nexus designated Zhora:  incept June 13th 2017, athletic conditioning, highly competitive, special abilities in the entertainment field.

It's okay.  Forget it.

I'll but you one.  What'll you have?

Prosit.

Sorry, don't have the time.

Two months.  But this one is not guy.  It is girl.  His girl.

No thanks.

Four years.

No.  I got a problem.

These aren't just...

Huh huh.

They'll change the limit before I change my mind.

Yes?

Of course.

What night?

I don't know nothing about it.

You mean the snake.

Does it eat?

I'd never get an abortion.

I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.

I work alone.

I am.  Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out.

If they are smart, they take naps.

Yeah.  Sometimes.

What?

I don't like people snooping around my stuff.

You mean a woman?

Nope.  Nobody could stand me that long.

No, I don't.

You know where I been.  I been on vacation.

Severed spine.  You'd better get in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.

Yes.

Of course.

I never seen a turtle.

They left.

You scared me.

Is that why you're still here?

You like it?

I'm Adam Webber.

Fallout shelter. There's a difference.

For how long?

Oh, brother...

Do ya?

Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.

Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.

Oh, that's nice.

Yes, I'm right?

Get away from me!!

So what?!  I've got two of him!  And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons. I was holding these out, too.

It's Webber.  Adam Webber.

What is it?!

Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!

Why doesn't it never work out?

It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.

I've got to make at least a thousand a week.

Sure.

What?

It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.

And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...

The big one!

Everybody's divorced.

I like it.

Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!

Wow.

No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.

Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?

Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...

Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--

No way.

Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!

Okay. All right.  And what do I say?

You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!

Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!!

What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!

Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!

No.

Yes, Eve?

And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!

...All right, Eve.  If you say so.

Yes, it is.

Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes! But  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?!

Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father! Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for my wasted life?!  Everything has been so awful!!

The front door is open.  Will you be back?

Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.

Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!

No, son. A pitcher.

Then why go there?

No, son! We wait for night.  Now...is precisely when... we must be at our... most cautious.

Yes, father?! Yes?

Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.

Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.

Yes, sir. It's true.

I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?

You nut!

1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course.

You don't have a computer in your cabin?

I'm not wearing his pants.

Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.

I guess living up here makes people look older.

Up there!!

How do you do, ma'am.

Well, we're here to help!

Yes, ma'am.

Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents.

Yes.

I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--

Cute Little Old Man, if you want a boy, I can be a boy.  And if you want a girl, I can be a girl.  I can be anything you want me to be!

Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture.

You bet, hon!

We'll do this again! Maybe next week. Here's your hat. Could I wrap something up for you? Did you have a coat?

I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.

Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!

Yes, dear!

To you maybe.

The locks.

To go up.

No.

Honey?

No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!

Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.

You bet.

And I made these!

Yes...

Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.

I thought ten years.

Some time.

Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?

Money is no object.  He's got cards up the wazoo.

He's from Alaska.

To bed.

Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses...

I know...I know. You did the right thing.

What?!

Fallout shelter.

Give it back to him.

I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!

Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.

Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by.

Darling, where are the glasses? Oh, here they are.

EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. Let Tits see her kid.

Yes.

Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?

You did? A human ear?

It must be great.

Yes.

Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.

Oh my God. Is her son OK?

I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed.

Well.

Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.

No.

It's okay. It's okay.

Yes, I like you.

What?

You don't?

Who's it, you mean.

There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.

No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble?

No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.

Yes.

Beeeee careful.

There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. There is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. In every hole. It's opening me to a death.

If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.

Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?

Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.

Okay Frank.

Be right down.

It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.

Jeffrey! Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store, maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.

Yeah, I know.

I'll get a coat for her.

It's good to see you, Dad.

Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.

I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.

Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?

I don't know. He moved away.

Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.

I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.

I don't know.

Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.

There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. Sometimes, in some cases, it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment, you know, sneak in and hide and observe.

Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. Aren't you curious about my plan?

Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?

First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.

I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.

I'm really sorry.

That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?

Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well- dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.

Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.

Nothing, really! It's good to see you.

You look beautiful.

I like that idea, that's a real good idea.

I can't dance fast.

Go ahead!

Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.

Okay.

Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around.

I can't find the second one, sir.

Get a hold of yourself, man.

Yes.

Weird, huh?... Know what I think is weird? Decent men with loving families go home every day after work. They turn on the news and see rapists, murderers, and child molesters all getting out of prison.

Fuck it! I'm doing it. I deserve it. I've been working for those fat bastards since I was in high school and look at this place.

He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years?

I know what the fuck he looks like!

Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.

What the hell are you doin' with Da's gun!?

So you're telling me it was one guy with six guns? A-and he was a senior fucking citizen?

Shut it. It's Ma.

We'll find it. Just calm down.

Aye.

Oh, you're good. What were you gonna do? Laugh the last three to death, funny man?

Little girls catchin' stray bullets in their heads, playin' hopscotch in their front yards. And everyone thinks the same thing... Someone should just go kill those motherfuckers.

Holy shit. Who? How many?

I'm strangely comfortable with it.

Rocco, this is the real deal. We must kill without hesitation, without guilt or remorse. Evil man, dead man.

A-fuckin'-men!

We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.

With every breath we shall hunt them down.

Do you know where that term comes from? In the early 1900's it was legal for men to beat their wives as long as they used a stick no wider than their thumb.

My, my...

These guys were pros. I think they were coming for one target, the fag man, he was the...

No way they could have seen it?

Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy theory and Serial crusher theory. Top fucking notch.  What's your name?

Twist of lemon!

Okay, seriously, both you listen ta me now.

Just called ta torture us did ya?

Don't kill me. Oh shit, please no. I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man!... the funny man... the funny.

Hallelujah, Jaffar.

Hey, Murph.

Yeah. Anybody call for me?

I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.

This is some crazy shit, man!

So?

Well, what'ya do?

You believe?

Then you must find out what your beliefs are.

You know them personally?

Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?

Yes.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.

Open it!

Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.

He says, "What's your third wish?" And the guys says, "I-I want you to beat me half to death."

Right. The blond guy.

He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.

See, your mind is very good with the more mechanical details. Whereas my strength would be --

She's an attractive older woman.

What do you think the cops have?

Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.

Eight dollars.

Hang on a second.

You think we're going to be chased?

We know there's another stocker.

Unlock that door.  Check the aisles.

We got it. We got it.

Oh, shit. That was scary. In the middle of the robbery. The manager looks at me. Right in the eye. And goes, I'm going to remember you.

I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.

I keep it for emergencies.

I'll say it.

Bob?

Sure.

No kidding.

No, no. Look. OK. Let's stay here until we find out what's going on.

Yes... It's true.

He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.

Well, I didn't do it, did I?

I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.

No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you later.

What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.

I don't know, Dignan. I just --

You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred --

Who's Mr. Henry?

Let me feel that.

Easy, Dignan. It's OK.

Hopefully this trip'll go a little smoother than the last one.

Yes. I do.

Hang on a second.

It was Bob. His walkie talkie's busted.

I don't know.

I don't think so.

We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs.

How?

It's called a racquet, Anthony, and you're holding it wrong. That's ghetto play. Hold it like this.

Thanks.

Grammar.

What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person.

Take a deep breath.

It feels good.

I want to ask a favor, boys. One day, when I'm long gone and all but forgotten, make one last toast to Abe Henry. And remember me as a friend.

Yeah.

Yeah. He said that.

I hope not.

And if Future Man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. All right?

Is that OK?

Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time.

Sixty days?

Sure.

My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on.

No.

I didn't do anything.

I hear you're a good thief.

Uh-uh.

Abdul-Shabazz?

The front stairs.

Well, this isn't really a party per se.

I thought your parents were in Italy.

That never would of --

It's true, Dignan.

Good question.

I told you he's crazy.

I warned you, Dignan.

Maybe she turned.

I just want to see how much bullets it takes.

Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.

That's good. Keep it at forty.

Be cool, Bob. Be cool.  Make that light.

There were more than that.

I don't know.

Well, obviously, we got to go back.

Come on, Dignan.

I can't do that, Bob.

His name's not Future Man, Dignan.

What is it?

That's right. I only have one vote. We'll go talk with Anthony and figure it out.

Not a whole lot, Bob.

Yeah. It is.

I don't expect an apology and I don't even want one. I just want us to --

I don't want to fight you, Dignan.

We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.

I'm working on it.

Yeah. Hey, Clay.

Yes.

Who? Applejack?

He's going to watch the back stairwell, remember?  Don't worry about it.

I don't know. Maybe in literature. That's his section.

Sure.

Si. Tecate. You like to fight?

No. Me no Hoto. Tecate?

It's locked.

And the Landy woman?

Save it for Bourne.

Never heard of it.

He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files, Ward.

Did he say anything to you?

I'm sorry, Ward.

It was staged?

Keep going...

Okay... 

Then what?

How... how can... how can you be here and say this?

Conklin.

I don't know! Why would I lie?

-- take the back -- get another car --

-- it's always bad and it's never anything but bits and pieces anyway!  You ever think that maybe it's just making it worse? You don't wonder that?

We pushed it. We got lazy.

It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?

No. Not this. This is real.  And he's right there... 

We can't wait to be sure.

-- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --

It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.

Why you're alive?  You're alive because you're special. Because she kept you alive.  Because we want you back on our side.

-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --

Me? Four years.

Yes, sir -- ma'am...

You were his local contact. You were with him the night Conklin died. You're coming with us.

I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.

If you say so.

These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.

What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.

Yeah, that'll work...What the hell was he doing here?

Alright... I want you, Kurt and Kim to stay on Bourne, track everything that's out there...

Are we hacking or asking?

Saying goodbye in their own way -- in outlawed tartans, with outlawed pipes, playing outlawed tunes.

We cannot defeat this --

He strained his leg so that it pains him to ride. But he sends his greetings -- and says that I speak for all the Bruces. And for Scotland.

Before he lost his powers of speech, he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know Wallace was dead.

Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.

No. One of us is enough.

With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm!

You win.

The test of a soldier is not in his arm. It's here.

He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.

He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.

It matters not, he is thy king!

Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!

This night is too beautiful to have again.

My parents are growing suspicious! I can't keep meeting you every night!

He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.

Wife of Edward, the king's son?

York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.

She was my wife. We married in secret because I would not share her with an English lord. They killed her to get to me. And she was pregnant.

Exactly.

When I asked Evan about his drawing, well, he didn't remember doing it.

Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?

A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.

Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.

How soon?...

Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll have plenty of time.

But Lenny said that his dad's coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad...

Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one!

Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.

What? What could he do?

Can you protect me?

Weirder than this?

You know my father?

I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.

It's coming... argh! I can't!

Are you sure? Not even with my father?

But I... I need those books.

Photos?

I thought you were a December baby.

Like Ozzy.

Huh?

He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.

Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...

They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.

Of course.

Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.

Mmmm... You give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed.

Well I remember he had one... but he, like, put it away after the first day. Why would that freak me out?

Simple math. When I woke up this morning and saw your smile... I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.

Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.

Like how?

He's a fucking maniac!

No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.

You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.

Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?

Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?

I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit.

That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.

It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.

It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy.

Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your --

Maybe if I can figure out how the memories of a simple worm function, it'll help me understand the complexities of the human brain.

Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.

What happened?? Where are we?!

It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.

I think I'll go check out the chapel.

I come from a big family.

Oh my God oh my God...

You're such a retard!

What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.

My husband is with me, too.

No.

I thought so. Where's your husband?

Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.

Oh, yes.

Oh, yes, please.

I'm sorry. It is.

I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the --

I won't.

Goodnight, Monsieur Rick.

It has been a pleasure to meet you.

It's not for sale.

Good day.

You needn't be concerned about me.

This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.

And the other alternative?

No.

I will.

And I was wondering.

Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.

Looking for a job.

Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?

Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.

It doesn't matter.

Yes.

You can believe that if you want to.

Please.

You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.

What of it? I'm going to die in Casablanca. It's a good spot for it.

All except one. He won't have you.

No, not yet.

Everything is quite all right.

I'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away.

Hello, Miss Ilsa. I never expected to see you again.

Oh, he never... well...  he's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot. He goes up there all the time.

But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it?

Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.

But no intention of selling them. One would think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him, money would.

Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I don't know why he said that.

Sam?

He came from Paris with Rick.

Oh, you've already met Rick, Mademoiselle?

How do you do?

Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.

My office.

Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.

You love her that much?

Oh, save it. We've still lots of things to do.

Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?

Good. I've got the letters right here, all made out in blank.

I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.

Very well.

I slept very well.

May we proceed with the business?

I was in a German concentration camp for a year. That's honor enough for a lifetime.

Yes.

Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.

If I didn't give them to you in a concentration camp where you had more "persuasive methods" at your disposal, I certainly won't give them to you now.

Good day.

Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.

I expected no less, Captain.

How do you do, Mr. Rick?

How about New York?

Perhaps.

Mademoiselle.

I see what you mean.

How extravagant you are, throwing away women like that. Someday they may be scarce.

When it comes to women, you're a true democrat.

Yeah? Have a brandy?

Victor Laszlo?

-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.

Okay.

Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.

Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?

Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.

Oh, I see. Gestapo spank.

-- Thanks. I will.

Well, it looks like you're a little late.

Stay where you are. I don't know what you're talking about.

I never make plans that far ahead.

Take your hands off me!

Victor Laszlo published the foulest lies in the Prague newspapers until the very day we marched in, and even after that he continued to print scandal sheets in a cellar.

Good evening, Mr. Blaine.

Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?

For how long?

Yeah, but I ain't got time to spend the money I make here.

No.

Shut up and go home, will you?

Just a little something of my own.

No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her.

Come on, shape up, get going, you can do it.

Take it.

Take it, damn it.

You idiot, if he dives, he'll capsize the raft.

Shut up.

No.

As much as anybody.

Do you...have any more packages to deliver?

Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.

Sure.

Had a package to deliver.

You smell like formaldehyde.

I thought I did.

Let me guess, Russia came up?

For when I travel?

You can't go now.

You have any children?

Is that Jango?

It means a lot...that you came.

And how was your Christmas?

Under the circumstances your overall health is good.  Those salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated, but they're healing nicely.

And fish are very low in fat, which is energy inefficient.  So you're going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat.  Luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas, which contain some Vitamin C, so you didn't get scurvy.

I most definitely say I am.

Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You want a lift?  I've just got one more pickup.

Yeah.

Come on down to the plant.  It's state of the art.  We're doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business.

Don't you even think about it.

Roger got me on.  I wasn't doing anything, and -- but you're back, you're really back.  I would have come to Memphis, but --

The tide saved me, Mom.  I lived by it. I'm just wondering where it will take me next.

What about the sender?

It was fifteen minutes late.

We're warriors, not desk jockeys.  We've got to be bold.  You always want all your ducks lined up.  But nothing's 100 percent.  It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49. Hell, I'd take 40-60.  Then roll the dice.

It's me.

You beat 'em to shit, pal!  Jesus!

Want to see my raft?

Time I had lots of.

Deep, real deep.

It claims to restore monthly regularity.

You weren't dreaming about me.

You were! You *are*! It was fantastic.

They just want you to hire some new help.

We all know who trained Homer--his credentials are as good as mine are. Don't you be holy to me about the *law*! What has the law done for any of us here?

He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.

What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?

I know.

They'll believe it because they want to believe it.

He mentions Homer, too, you know.

Candy. Candy Kendall.

Two.

Really?

Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout.

When they watched at all. Do you like movies?

You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the movie.

Not with the right girl you wouldn't.

Right.

I'm just waiting and seeing. Like you said.

Okay, okay--I know you do, too.

I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere...

Hi...

Yes, I *have*!

No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...

Well, this *is* an orphanage.

Well, *picking* them is! It's about as exciting as... walking!

I love you, too. See you tomorrow.

I know what you've been doing.

You mean somebody asked?

But what about school records? Homer doesn't have any *diplomas*...

Is that soon?

Actually, someone did. I just didn't think I could eat anything.

Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?

The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring.

What about the trees?

Uh... actually, picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while. I'm grateful for the job.

Right.

Homer, you the only one who's read them rules, so you the only one who feels like he's doin' somethin' wrong.

Is it true?

You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?

Go on, cut my clothes. I've got other clothes.

One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.

Yes, for both.

Obviously.

I haven't read that.

But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?

We haven't had a Wilbur here in a year or so, have we? We used to have *dozens*!

Of course.

No trouble.

*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.

Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter.

You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!

Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*!

Anyway, I was just showing you this guy as an example of what's available-- I didn't think you'd be interested.

We see you next harvest.

They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree!

What view?

Tell him what you want, Muddy--*you* is the crew boss today.

That's right. I know you understand how I feel, Homer--you is breakin' them rules, too. Ain't that right?

That's right--that sounds like trouble to me.

You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...

She's about the most beautiful girl I ever seen--I don't know if she's the nicest.

The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...

He ain't never been outta Maine!

I wasn't sure if you'd make it.

You're welcome. I was just going to ask you if you'd like to join us.

A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.

Sort of like a letter of intent.

Jake? Right. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Yeah, it's going through --

Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.

Know who I am, Jake?

We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.

Isn't it always?

Suits used to say that in any con, sooner or later someone's going to start asking the right questions. Usually, it takes a little longer.

You know when the first con was ever played? It was when Adam fell for Eve in the Garden of Eden.

I was doing it for them.

After you cut her loose.

Probably safe in the hands of the Federal Government.

Guess so.

Let's see... Let's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught. We get our money back, but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation. I don't much like that idea. Then again, let's suppose he actually gets through Customs. Now, that'll be something. We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud. We double our money.

And how much did you say you wanted for this... What did you call it? A finder's fee?

Mob?

We're going to give him the money back?

People have tried this before, Jake. It's never worked. Teddy Fraiser and his crew went on vacation in Chicago for it. Last year, Mumps got pinched in L.A.

I gotta work off some of this adrenaline. I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn. Anybody want in?

Well, this is just fucking great...

And what about Big Al?

So then Miles walks straight into the Creative Director's office and says "The code's fine, the program's for shit" and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guy's desk!

And all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow.

You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. Good suits, good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. It's all take, take, take. You can't just be fucking witty about it.

I can't do that.

Let me rephrase -- I won't do that.

I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.

I need you to stake me.

You're not going to bust out baby oil and start rubbing me down or anything, are you?

All the shit we pulled with you and you're trying to shake us down? You guys got sack.

Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with your daughter. Carolyn. We met once or twice.

Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?

Very much so.

Sure.

What about this situation makes you think I can answer that question right now?

What?

Then show me how.

Good quality porn has it's place in the world.

Intuition. It doesn't make you Yoda. Like tonight. You killed that guy tonight. But I knew you would.

Sounds respectable.

Lily... Jesus Christ...

No, I'm not going to take it easy. You can't stay clear of this guy. He will be on this until the end of time.

What about what?

You sold me out. You should have trusted me like I trusted you. You fucked up. You fucked up HUGE.

Now you're an accomplice in a homicide. Everything you thought you were in control of just flew out the window or is dripping down your leg.

We never had a problem with that before.

What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.

You sure?

And we got rid of the red head.

With identification.

You going to have the time?

You were right. He's trying to fuck you. You want it, you gotta get it at the airport...

Not easy pickin's. Papers like these speak to larger issues. Sorry about Alfonse.  You into something big?

Huh? Oh. She's alright.

A little bit of both.

Then who's the Banker?

I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it.

I want him for something big and to do that, we have to catch him in the act.

We're here.

Roger that.

It's cosmetic. They don't cover cosmetic. Last year I had a tooth capped. The dentist tells me I'm not covered for caps. It's cosmetic.

Maybe another time.

All men are cheats.

I can imagine.

I despise the job.

Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others.

What are you talking about?

How about five hundred.

Seven-fifty.

Did she?  You were pretty thick at one time.

Habib?

I'll try and make it.

Not entirely.

Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it.

It's only hair. I haven't changed.

Probably.

What about a drink on the way home?

-- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it.

Leave it.

Marion!  What did you tell the police?

Well I've got something for you. In London, I mean. I've been chatting to some friends. Do you know the Golden Lion casino? It's in Bayswater, I believe... They're looking for a dealer, a croupier.

All right, dad. Yes, I'll call him.

You know where I'm from?

That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me?

There's a casino in this hotel.

In the casino.

Absolutely not.

I'll watch.

Then you're not a pro.

You keep the ten thousand pounds.

Wait a minute...

Let it go.

Jack! It's Jani.

Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months.

Because if a supervisor knew I'd seen you and I hadn't reported it, I'd lose my job as well. And I can't afford that.

I don't gamble.

Jack.

Has he?

No.

I was at Beadles.

Do you have a Salon Prive?

Give me 365.

We do. 

Five.

How?

Fine.

Does he win?

A pleasure. Pity about Bella.

What flickering light?

Eventual supernova.

Key?

Boiler, we're alive. My heart.

Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula...

I read the same here.

-- open quantum latches --

Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.

Hey, bomb.

I said I'm trying to reach Talby. Something's wrong with the damn intercom. I need a last-minute diameter approximation.

Doolittle...

Any planets?

Any of 'em any good?

What?

-- remove thrust drive repellant --

I wish I had my board with me now. Even if I could only polish it once in awhile.

Calm down, Talby. I'm coming.

Doolittle, you must tell me one thing.

Doolittle, hello?

Sorry.

Bruno's girlfriend.

No?

Sooo...whattya think?  Maybe after I betray the woman who trusts me and you take her and her daughter out and execute them...we could go on a date.  Play a little miniature golf or somethin'.

I like to keep it professional, that's all.

None of your business.

Where?

You mean until you showed up?

I'm really glad we're having this conversation.  You're right.  I was angry at you.  But talking about it-- The scales have fallen from my eyes and I see now that it was all my fault.  Can you ever forgive me?

No time.

Don't look down.

It concerns only Jah.  But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High.

Theo rode for this place a long time, man.

A grand.

Am I?

I got overhead...

Yech...

And for all his cattin' around, not much of a stick man either.

Every week.

But why can't we stay here?

If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me.

Mommy, I'm scared.

We're just a little tense right now...  It's okay.

The goddess who comprehends all goddesses, eye of Ra, protector, avenger, and destroyer, giver of life, who lives forever... I could keep going.

We didn't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night.

The one you're wearing?

Lauren's not my wife.

You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.

Me?  You're the one who tried to rip off this piece.

You did go through my stuff.

How well do you remember the lab?

The woman you met, Lauren.  She supervised workers removing cortodiazapine from gel caps by hand and replacing it with powdered sugar.  The real drug was shipped out of the country. The placebos were distributed to County VA Hospital and six veterans' clinics in the area.

Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.

I've never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen, I just know they do.  So the job's to figure out how to deal with the consequences.  Which you did... You took that sonuvabitch out.

Look, thank you for this but--

And I feel real bad about all that but it doesn't mean I need to get involved.

Ladies would be elsewhere.

You don't want to.

She may be easy on the eyes but she's trouble, trust me.  Hot run to two-oh-two Sansomme.

Can't help you.

Any idea when she'll be back?

A friend of your fiance's.

To set the record straight about where he was the other night when he said he was working late.

He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately?  That's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back.  Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting.  He didn't either...at first.

Now, here's how it's gonna be, Lydia. You're gonna take your threats and your acrylic nails, and you're gonna go home and figure out your marriage, instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do, understand?

I understand.

They don't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks, which is something I'm not even going to ask about--

Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?

What guys do.  'Nother order.

I just don't go in with any expectations.

You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.

How long you and me known each other?

Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?

They don't have a lot of moving parts.

I'll bet you can.  Sit.

Not right now?  Okay, when?

I know what I got, Max.  They put me back on that drug they're giving the other vets.  Only the guy does those cable hacks says the stuff's no good.

But I'll take a rain check...

Max--

Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged.

Lydia.

You don't.

None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't.

You're too kind. I'm Amanda.

I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me.

Gin.

Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we?

Believe it or not, you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband... the champion of lousy lovemaking. The man who thinks he's the biggest and the best... The man who thinks every secretary, stewardess, and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor. The man for whom faking it was invented. Christ, if I hadn't gotten pregnant with our son, I would have never known I even had sex with the prick.

Yeah, a man's drink...

Believe it.

Beth, I can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how I've always felt about you... Call me Jam. It's my band name.

Let's not think about the past. Let's just think about from today on. I'll never forget you, Jam.

Stan Lee couldn't think of a better one.

Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.

Stellas. I hate stellas almost as much as I hate dogs.

Okay, enough. Enough. Gimme the tickets. I wanna hold onto them.

The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar

The paint!

Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.

Oh, yeah...?

Hawk?

Kind of funny, I thought He'd be pissed as hell at me.

Jam, not another word out of your femmy-ass mouth! Okay, we're here, we got nothing, and we got an hour and a half. We're totally committed. It's time to brainstorm.

Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?

You're a smart boy, Jeremiah. And so handsome.

I just lost my virginity in a confessional booth! Lord have mercy!!

Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath.

Oh, this is terrible... Please go on.

Wake up, Lex! We just watched Jam's mom torch our fuckin' KISS tickets! Not REO Speedwagon! Not Journey! Not the Bay City Rollers! KISS! If you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom, I'd sure like to hear it!

We won?!

Yeah? I have a saying too, Lex. It goes, "Catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us, asshole." We're going this time and that's all there is to it.

Hello summer detention.

Let's lift up her shirt.

Fuck you, Lex! This whole thing wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you jinxing us. I just made an honest mistake.

A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.

No, you gimme your gun, boy!

Gene Klein, Stanley Eisen, Paul Frehley, and Peter...Criscula! Yeah, that's it!

Good morning...

If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?

What did you say?

Go home. Go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine.

Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.

I'm going home.

No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got there.

Why?

I don't want to talk about it.  So what happened to your neck?

No... Donnie, wait. I've never...

Are you okay?

Infant Memory Generators.

What's wrong with you?

But you're OK?

It's safe here.

Where are we going?

Who's Frank?

When did you stop taking your medication?

Fine. You know, Dr. Thurman isn't so bad a lady. I can tell her anything.

Do they know yet?

Where it came from?

So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?

Well... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds. When they flood the house. That like... destruction is a form of creation. So the fact that they burn the money is... ironic. They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.  They want to change things.

Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?

Of course. A rabbit is not like us. It has no history books... it has no knowledge of sorrow or regret. I like bunnies and all. They're cute... and they're horny. And if you're cute and horny... then you're probably happy that you don't know who you are... or why you're even alive. But the only thing I've known rabbits to do is have sex as many times as possible before they die.

Frank.

I don't own a television.

I met a girl.

I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.

No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...

Have you told Gretchen about the spears?

I... I was playing with fire.

But you were punished.

You've done it again?

Why did you do these things, Donnie? Did Frank tell you to commit these crimes?

I have the power to build a time machine.

Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.

Frank is going to kill.

If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else.

You will survive this... Donald. I promise you that you will survive. You must let me help you.  And when I clap my hands together, you will wake up.

What does time travel have to do with philosophy?

What I think is going on with your son.

You are entering a new dimension of sight and sound...

Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?

That's enough.

Mr. Cole... not only am I a TEACHER... but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex child. Therefore, I am the ONLY person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.

Fuck yeah there is! If the bus doesn't show up in thirty minutes, you're supposed to go straight home.

No. Mom said if I did, she'd look up my dad and marry him.

My mom wanted me to have this?

Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!

Your parents'd kill you.

Oh, yeah, sure. You know, every pageant is special, but this one is extra-special to me. When I was seventeen, I don't know if you know this, but I was crowned Mount Rose's American Teen Princess. And this year... drum roll please, my lovely daughter, Rebecca Ann Leeman is competin'.

Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant.

I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.

Honest to God, if I got to do it over? I'd start walkin' outta this town the minute I took my first step. Practically the only thing I wouldn't do different is have you...

I love you much.

Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant.

You heard me. Where is it?

Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!

Bitch!

Hi.

Then it must be Wednesday.

I tell Annette, I says, "You talk to me durin' my stories, you might as well be talkin' to the wall."  You guys want a beer?

Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.

I'll be right back. See ya later.

So? Be real easy.

That's right.

I wonder how she's gonna fix that one.

We're not in the showroom, Dear.

Oh, all right  How soon they forget where all this comes from.

Gladys! Stop it!

Let go! Let go of me. Oh my God, it's COPS!

A.k.a. Minneapolis -- St. Paul.

That's why we Lutherans use grape Koolaid for the blood of Christ.

"Proud... to be... an... American."

We need more bars!

Come on! Hankey here can't help it if he was born crazier than a shithouse rat!

The king can do no wrong! 

"My dear President"...

Is that all?

I'll have to enclose the check first.

Take a letter...

Eureka Ammunition Company, Gentlemen. Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight.  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way. However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty and I don't say that to everybody.  Have not received last month's drawing account; how come your neck is like a swan.  Yours very truly...

He's half poodle and half watch dog -

Yankee Poodle.

Then you don't wanna work hard?

He's-a very easy to insult --  I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.

You told it to me.

I think we oughtta have a standing army, so we can save money on chairs.

We've gotta have somebody who knows how to get secrets from men.  You know how to make love?

We gotta two battalions and one Frenchman.

Tired!  I'd like to stretch this into a week -

Your Excellency, haven't we met before?

Can't we go some place where we can be alone?

Well, why not say the least and get it over with?

No, that wasn't it...

You can keep it -- I've got a whole pack...  Now what were you saying?

You satisfied your selfish whims, while nations tottered, dynasties rocked and the world plunged headlong into a chasm of chaos and oblivion --  Not bad, eh?

Mrs. Teasdale -- no matter who rules Freedonia, to me you will always be the first lady of the land.

Perhaps he will listen to you...

How lovely.

Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.

Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.

...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?

Aw, Bytes, he's sick.

I'll show you! I'll show you!

Shut up!

He fell.  He falls.

Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.

All you do is profit from another man's misery!

No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.

Yes, I'm well aware of that. But this case is quite exceptional.

Yes sir, I'll look into that.  Would you like to meet him sir?

Well sir, perhaps I should explain...

Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee.

Speaking is one thing, Treves, but can the man comprehend?

Fine, fine. You know, your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing, Treves. But you must remember that this is a hospital, and there are many patients here. Patients who can be made well, and you owe them your first consideration. Just don't become so obsessed, old man, that you begin to neglect them.

I don't understand.

I could easily arrange...

No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him.

Steady on, Treves. Have a seat.

Everyone has been very kind. I am extremely grateful.

He's imbecile, no doubt from birth. He speaks, but... it's all gibberish. No, the man's a homeless idiot...  I pray God he's an idiot.

Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is "like me".

Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits.

I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward.

It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance.

Good day, Mr. Merrick.

I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited.

Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.

The main spire.

Yes John!

Yyyess.

Hello... my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you.

I promise you. You will never see the inside of that horrible place again. You will never, ever go back to the workhouse... or that man. It's a splendid room, don't you think?

Not at all, John.

Oh, our relatives... the children.

Oh no, I couldn't.

Yes! The workhouse!

We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.

A dressing bag.

Welcome home, John.

When I left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound.

And who might you be, sir?

There IS no one.

There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.

But one day I'll catch you... Like I caught her...

But, Father, it IS!

PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!

Put them down!  PLEASE make them put them down.

What... you mean "got into bed with" them?

Why?

Goodbye, Aud...

There is something I must ask the Gods...

But, Aud... I... I came to find someone...

Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods... so... I disguised myself to sabotage their plans.

It is day, of course, Freya.

No... no...  We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we?

REALLY?

No, no... It was very... er, nice.

Well, how d'you think I feel?

Don't talk nonsense.

Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.

Sh!

You don't love ME.

What d'you expect? You come in here, burn my village, kill my family and try to rape me...

And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.

I didn't mean to!

Find it... AND cross it!

Come on, move it!

It saved my father!

You don't go through all the hardships of an ocean voyage to make "friends".

I know!

Sorry.

Shut up. You there. You there and you there.

The sun! That's it!

Why should WE care?

Well, come on!

To the oars!

But...

How about making friends?

What is it?

We haven't got a spare place.

Bye... sorry...

You will wait?

Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.

That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.

Mum! Dad!

Help!

By YOU -- Keitel Blacksmith! Don't you know, Erik, that is why he went with you? Ragnarok was good for his business...

I know, Dad.

But it's a responsibility...

I must only let the red rage...

I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES!

Yes, Mother.

No, Mother.

She's punishing me for being honest. I should just go to her house.

I hope you feel better, sweetie.

Say hi to Naomi.

No one.

But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?

You did? You liked me?

You were not.

I can't. I want to, but I have to study.

In the room?

It's gorgeous.  Just my taste. I've never  gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I liked.  Thanks. So let's get going. Long drive.

Nothing is wrong with you. You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.

I don't know any jokes about your name.

See, I wouldn't think that about you.

Probably see you at the book store.

I don't want to take you out of your way.

Yeah?

What?

Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --

Very much.

Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?

I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!

No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?

I don't know.

I do have a tendency to use that word too much.

Yeah.

That's scary sounding.

I think so.

I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...

Yes.

It's three.

Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.

No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.

I don't want to talk about this here.

Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --

Would you get me another, Joely?

No, it isn't that.

Yeah, Tangerine?

Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!

I don't know.

I love it!

Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.

Not yet. Not married.

Okay.

You had the whole human race pegged.

It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.

I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.

I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.

I know.

I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.

Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?

Yeah, yeah. It goes "Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines"?

What are you doing?

I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. You said, "so go" with such disdain.

I love you.

Says you were a bully...

I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.

What old mill? Is that somewhere we --

I just walked in.

I loved you on this day. I love this memory. The rain. Us just hanging.

I didn't want to do this. But I had to or they would've called me a girl.

This is it. The night we met. My God, it's over.

Well... I did.

You have to stop this!

No. I just need some space, maybe.

It's not somebody else.

You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.

I miss you.

I don't know. I'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny.

Sorry. I just --

Go.

Yeah.

Where?

Do you swear you didn't know?

How did I look?

Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.

Nothing.

Is that Nietzsche?

It's a good quote, Mary. I'm glad we both know it.

Really? I thought it was appropriate maybe. That's all.  I really admire the work that you do. I know it's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to --

Okay. Good. Great. Thanks.  I like you, Howard... an awful lot. Is that terrible?

That's fine, Stan.

Thanks, Stan. Thanks.

Jesus.

Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.

Siwash, huh?

Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.

She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City.

I don't.

Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving.

About...

No, ma'am. No way. There's girls on the Rubber Rose who are political, but I don't share their views. I got no cowgirl ideology to expound. "Politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it."

So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?

'Drugged' is a stupid word.

I suppose it was mine. Yes, it definitely was my fault.

American Cheese. The king of road food.

I was a successful model once.

I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off.

Does that mean you might have an assignment for me?

I heard it.

I'm in the Second Containment area. It's pitch black in here. There must have been a coolant leak. Man, this shit is everywhere. I can't see a damn thing.

Justin?

Don't start with me, Cooper.

EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak.

You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's Justin's turn. Stay on station. If anything happens...

On my way.

You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.

You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you? It fell down.

What about the accumulator...?

Oh God...

Nothing. It's nothing.

I apologize for the short notice, Bill, but we've had something come up that requires your immediate attention. Lyle?

I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.

Thank you.

You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein.

What's on your mind?

It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...

The dark inside me.

We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.

That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering.

You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright?

Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.

No, no, its alright. I talked to my ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas and I'll get him this summer.  Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen him in two months.

Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze.

There's no one here, Skipper.

What you got, Peters?

Alive?

It's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core, distorting space-time. They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark.

It's complicated...

"Insane?" The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. The Event Horizon could be there in a day...

There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control.

The date.

The Core...!

What makes you think I'll miss?

Starck... Cooper...

Locked and cocked.

Yes, sir.

I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?

Get outside, go back to work. I'll join you shortly.

But you can breathe it.

We can take the filters from the Clark...

What about the life readings you picked up?

Dr. Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something...

Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.

He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.

We've got to shut it down, we've got to...

You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. You still haven't seen any crew?

I did.

Not according to the computer.

Keep him talking.

Dead ahead, 5000 meters.

She's not ugly.

Shit, Doc, any closer and we're gonna need a rubber...

Get them back --

I don't think this is a good idea, we don't even know what happened on that ship...

Do they have pressure?

I don't know. The life readings just went off the scale.

The forward airlock.

I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?

I wouldn't know anything about that.

Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.

Come on. Let me buy you something to eat. Looks like you could use the company.

To help you. I've run every test known to man. And they all yield the same result: the machine is ready.

And you can? Power it up?

Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.

I already got it. Everything I want.

This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA. And Victor's not that bad. He's just a little...  Larger than life.

Ben. This is business. Just work.

Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --

Youthful high spirits.

This makes five.

He's made a few changes.

Victor's better at these things.

Should?

I think I need to lie down. Bad shrimp.

Yeah, nine years straight.

If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.

Oh, you remember my name do you? You happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body?

Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--

'Course not. Strictly business.

They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.

Stay right. Left is trouble.

The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.

What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...

I can go hotter!

Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're... well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through. And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?

But all these people...

Please tell me you go silent too.

That's the temperature of the sun.

Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --

Are you kidding?

No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.

A gasket? Reed, we're at a party.

So reel him in. But we came here to do a job. So let's do it. Quickly.

I understand the business reasons.

I know it can't be easy. Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny. At least they can go out in public. But for you? People staring. Whispering behind your back...

Of course.

I don't want to talk about it here, Brad.

Come on, Spicoli. Why don't you just put your shirts back on? See the sign?

You really want me to put all this stuff back on?

U.S. History. Mr. Hand.

Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?

I don't care it you tell me or not. I got problems of my own.

Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent.

Why?

No, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. I took care of it, Dennis.

Yes, sir.

Dad says!

Oh, really?

Mark is a really nice boy...

Well...

I don't know. It's getting pretty late...

Come on...

I didn't see you this morning.

Mike. I want you to know that I'm pregnant.

All right, I take it back.

She's in my biology class.

Of course something happens. You put the vibe out to thirty million chicks, you know something's gonna happen.

Chicken!

Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove?

I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone says you're an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know him.' Well, you know, Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just finding out.

You're crazy. Those girls love me.

And they don't call my parents?

Fascinating.

Hey, mon, I don't know what your trip is, but...

He was hot, wasn't he?

What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.

There's nothing to it.

It was nice.

I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.

Not since November.

Stacy. What does it matter? He's a stereo salesman. You want to marry him? You want to have kids with him? You want this guy to come home, fifty years old, and he's still got that little Pacific Stereo badge on? Come on.

No. But it's a nice idea.

I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.

I don't know, I'm just so depressed. Everything is just so... depressing.

It could be. I had a pregnancy test at the clinic. I'll find out Monday. I guess it was Damone.

I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.

What?

Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open.

I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.

Did I do something wrong, Mr. Hand?

I don't know. I guess so.

No problem.

It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?

We keep them, in case the people come back.

Not at all.

Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck.

No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house.

Thanks. So...  What do you want to do?

Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan.

Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.

It's John Bonham's birthday.

I'll get you the notes.

Hi, Stacy. How are you?

Well... sure.  She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same.

My bags are out there in that white Cadillac convertible. Can you have someone drive it around to the room?

Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay.

Tell me. What do you want?

Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.

Dobermans don't talk.

Naw! Not a major.

Las Vegas.

What?

Wait a minute! Come back and have a beer!

It's okay. He's admiring the shape of your skull.

My heart!

You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your language! You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism!

And eat them! That bastard won't get away with this! What's going on in this country when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?

Maybe thirty more minutes. As your attorney, I advise you to drive at top speed. It'll be a goddamn miracle if we can get there before you turn into a wild animal. Are you ready for that? Checking into a Vegas hotel under a phony name with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid.

Lacerda?

But what about our room? And the golf shoes?

You bastard! They'll never let us back in that place. I leave you alone for three minutes and you start waving that goddamn marlin spike around -- yelling about reptiles! You scared the shit out of those people! They were ready to call the cops. Hell, the only reason they gave us press passes was to get you out of there...

Not much. Why?

That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.

Are you ready?

Why not? Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me! What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police!

She's perfect for this gig. These cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her. We can set her up in one of these back street motels, hang pictures of Jesus all over the room, then turn these pigs loose on her... Hell she's strong; she'll hold her own.

In a few hours, she'll probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering Jesus-based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel Samoan who fed her liquor and LSD, dragged her to a Vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing, uncircumcised member.

It just occurred to me, that she has no witnesses. Anything that she says about us is completely worthless.

They're actually nice people when you get to know them.

Right. Sure as hell some dope-dealing bomb freak is going to recognize you and put the word out that you're partying with a thousand cops.

Hurry up with those drinks. We're thirsty. Only two rums. Make mine a Bloody Mary.

We keep it quiet. It's not the kind of thing you'd want to talk about upstairs. Not with the press around.

Two glasses of ice water with ice.

We had abused every rule that Vegas lived by -- burning the locals, abusing the tourists, terrifying the help. The only chance now, I felt, was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could possibility believe it.

Never missed a plane yet.

Yeah... Explaining my Position. Some asshole wrote a poem about that once...

No! I swear I'm not!

You're damn right. But the first time you say anything about this, to anybody -- you'll go straight to prison for the rest of your life. What's your name?

Why not? It was getting warm anyway.

Yeah. I know. I'm guilty. I understand that. I knew it was a crime but I did it anyway. Shit, why argue? I'm a fucking criminal.

No! No! I swear to Jesus I never heard of that stuff!

Her fella.

With what just happened upstairs --

Hey. You noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile?

Come on, come on.

OPEN THE DOOR!

And the head?

Hey!

Easy.

There's a tunnel.

It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there.

This is a bottleneck waiting to happen.

The door... on three.

Just an observation.

Why don't you go check it out?

Yep.

Anyone else?

Uh, uh, I think if we can get everyone into it... we can get out of here.

It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.

Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue.

No, no, it calms you, makes everything nice and smooth. Just takes the edge off like a beer, but in a fraction of the time.

The girl's got rhythm.

How much I got, what?

Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising.

Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?

What?

Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex.

The boards are solid oak planks, and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this, least nothing the size of the beasts.

You're wasting your time, there's no one out there.

Holds four.

What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!

I don't trust you. No way! I pick who goes! And I'm holding you responsible.

Whoa!

I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew.

F-f-fuck you.

You smell like ass!

No bullshit.

What the hell's going on here!?

Gimme the keys.

REPEAT. WE NEED HELP. SOS. CALLING ALL CARS! WE NEED HELP AT THE UNITED NATIONS TAV--!

Ok. Let's see what happens.

Right. Were going to need some fire power.  Do you have any sort of guns or ammunition here? Anything at all?

Deal.

Um, my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where ragweed or spores might be present, sir.

'Forgive'...? For What?

Very fine bone structure.

Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific --

I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'

I'm not!

I'm not!

Huh.

Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have to sell me.

Who is she?

Well... well, you see, that's the point. You won't be opening in London.

I know, but --

In my eyes, officer.

GET OUT!

Dick, we need some time apart --

Dick...

I gotta go now.

All square, Doc.

Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.

But I'll never win that.

What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know.

Please, Francie...

Thank you.

I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...

As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due.

Oh, Angela! Go with these trappers! They'll lead you safely down the mountain...

I wouldn't miss it.

They'll mend.

Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that?

Right again. You're no more an atheist than my man's a Red, but what they're doin', see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours. Could look bad for your Daddy.

Well aren't you the smoothie. Now you're going to ask for my number, I suppose.

You looked okay.  Joint's pretty dead. How 'bout I take you home?

I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.

I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...

What?

Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?

Kaminski.

Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something --

I don't have what they want, Harry.  Harry, will you tell me something? How can I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?

Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?

Frances...

Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry.

For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.

I took the early rounds.

Frances, you're fulla drugs. You don't know what you're saying. Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her.

I guess.

Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground.

No. To thoroughbreds.

Huh?

Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this, I'll never ask again: Will you marry me?

Well... I'll act like I do until I do.

...Touch me again and I'll kill you, you pig.

I love you too, Frances.

Oh please, Harry... don't even think it. You're the only person who ever... It's just... Can't you wait for me?

Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.

Why do you say that?

What'd you do?

Who's writing this guy's lines?

I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?

That's fine with me...  Get it? Fine. A fine! Hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this, an audience or a jury?

'Golden Boy.'

Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!

You got it.

...You will.

Are you crazy? Unhand that woman! That's Amelia Earhart!

Why are these all opened?

Then why did you bring them?

Go on...

What's wrong?

Where are you going?

Yes, Mama.

Don't I know you?

Oh bullshit.

Please sit down...

All right. Will you please sit down now?  Symington says.

Stay calm, please.

And you accused her of tampering with your mail.

But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. Whom do you think I should believe?

'Cause if it's long enough, which I doubt, why don't you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass!

No!

What kindness?

Yes. Very close

People can be kinder than you think.

I don't know.

I will not! Kill me now!

Quite right!

Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors.

She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him.  I cannot do that alone.

He left a beautiful gift in her place. A baby boy. To cherish and love as our very own. Your brother

He needs to vent his outrage to the skies! Make yourself heard, Willie! Learning to walk is not an easy thing! Why should it be so?

Give me that child before you fill his head with drivel!

To be the best there ever was. To push our knowledge beyond our dreams... to eradicate disease and pestilence... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear...

Only you.

I know only that he is a killer. And I shall bring back his carcass.

I'm all right. I'm safe,

Why the change? What about your work?

I have been waiting for this ever since.

Open this door for no-one!

It wouldn't dare.

It's a letter to my father.

These are exciting times, Henry. We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought

Somebody has to!

Why Waldman? He of all people should have cheated death!

That is my concern.  I'm involved in something just now. I want to finish it in Waldman's memory.

Is that your diagnosis?

But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more... philosophical works.

It's utterly fantastic! This is the sort of thing I'm talking about! We should be learning this!

But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views!

I doubt that decision is still mine to make.

Why?

Numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system?

I'm... dying.

Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.

Who are you?

Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there...

Push on this side. Alice, this is Jack, Marcie and Ned. Push.

Thanks, Alice.

I finished the boats.

You're right. It makes no sense.

Artist.

Bad bulb or no power. It's getting a little gloomy in here.

Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.

I'll go take a look.

Don't burn that gorgeous body, or I'll scratch your eyes out...

I can't, Barry...

Where'd you get that stuff?

That was the telephone.

I was just wondering if you thought there'd by any other gorgeous women at Camp Crystal Lake. Besides yourself.

Makes me want to hold on and never let go.

Ned!

Mmmmmmmph.

Umhummmmph.

Rocky Road.

I think water got into the electrical system. You ride me back to camp? I'll get one of my counselors to drive me back tomorrow morning.

Vacation. I'm taking him to see his first bullfight.

Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.

You can't, but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a good start.

The truth hurts.

I have no idea.

Thank you, son.

To keep the daylight out! This is where they sleep! Get to the door!

On the dresser.

That's not fuckin' that...  this is fuckin' this.  Go sit over there.

Scott and Kate.

In heaven.

Yes.

How do I know you'll keep your word?

You won't let him touch her?

Shit, I been to bars make this place look like a fuckin' 4-H club.

No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.

To yours.

I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.

I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore.

Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half a chance you'd feed us to them!

Daddy's dead.

Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria Hill?

What about the report from an eyewitness at the liquor store who said one of the brothers was shot?

Is it safe to assume that because the death count involved and the loss of life of law enforcement officers, that the Bureau, the Rangers and the police force are taking this manhunt personally?

Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with the air conditioner blastin' all day long.

I'm by myself today, ate my lunch outta the microwave.

You could sue the shit out of her, ya know. That kid belongs under a circus tent, not flippin' burgers. You could own that fuckin' place.

Knock yourself out.

Letting him use your toilet? No store does that.

What? Are you kidding? I didn't do anything!

Well that don't matter now, 'cause you got about two fuckin' seconds to live! Richie!

This is a private club. You're not welcome.

Seth, he did it. You were by the beer cooler with your back turned. I was by the magazines, I could see his face.  And I saw him mouth:

You believe me don't cha?

How ya think, it hurts like a son-of- a-bitch.

Feels good.

What?

Really?

We are?

They broke when you fell.

When we get to El Ray, I'll take care of it.

That's how you're lookin', Richie.

That's what you look like.

It don't look together.

Yeah, it's mine.

He needs our help!

Thank you, ensign.

"Wickwire, Thomas Dane."  See what you can find.

-- nothing I can do about it unless you're suggesting I infringe on their civil liberties -- which I'd happily do if you'll just trim a little fat off the Constitution.

"Security"?  What the hell you talkin' about?  Your base isn't secure?

Then set out the good plates, we'll all have lunch.  My office will follow up with details.  Jumping off, now...

Same rules for everyone, sir.

So I'll get a fair shot?

Sir, if someone is suggesting that I'm a lesbian, they're wrong.

Fuck me.

I'll act surprised.

Yes, dear.

There'll be more to follow -- but yes, dear, right now you're the pick of a very large litter.  And your success would mean a lot.  Jumping, now...

Gonna be visiting that all-woman's America's cup team in a few weeks -- If I were a gambler, I'd say Dennis O'Conner's days are numbered.  But they're in San Diego, so I thought I'd take a quick promenade of the base.

Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.

Jordan.  Might we do this over lunch tomorrow?  I do very much want to talk, but now is scarcely --

I'm saying it's not going to happen. Not when the President is set to turn this into a third-rail issue should I choose to ever campaign against him.  He will fry me six ways to Sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war -- and, quite possibly, for bringing them back in body bags.

It's really "F. Lee Montgomery" -- but that gets whittled down to just "Flea."  For short, ma'am.

I'll work on it, ma'am.

Fuck.  Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction. Stand by for a PRC fix...

Spotted you, Chief.  Pri One is to slip you some air, so we're coming down with a tank -- just something until the A-team shows.  Over.

Sir?

Every class has its surprises, Pyro. This one'll be no different.

What "all females"?  If I'm the only --

Signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries.

Blank faces here, O'Neil.

Royce.  We're the same age, we started the same time -- and now you're sitting in the upperdecks while I'm still down in the bullpen. What does that tell you about the Navy?

You know, right up until you said that -- I thought I did know.

I feel like there's men here, there's women here -- then there's men.  But hey, what'd I expect?

Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you.

"Yes, Jordan -- I'll wait for you no matter how long."

Whose orders were those?

He was married?

You got anybody, Wick?

Let's keep talkin', Wick.  Just keep talkin' to me...

Sure, sure.

Just askin'

Mighta been civilian.

You heard me.  Move on.

McCool's that same rank.  We're both j.g.'s.

"Dad."

No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on --

I think you're the liar.

We didn't know we were compromised. Firing would only've given away our position.

No.

Show us where you are, Chief.

Listen, Sex Ape.  I'm here to stay. And if you don't want me for a roommate or classmate, you got two options -- move out or ring out. End of file.

Sure.  Now she wants to shoot.

Shut your hole, Slutnik.

Somebody throw a tent over this circus.

So am I.

Christ, I don't want to see her take a fall.  She thinks I do, but...

I don't...  What, someone on base?  A "mole"?

All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with.

Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.

Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna kill me.

We know, Audrey.

It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.

Didn't you tell me he left for the airport?

Perfect! You wanted a story, well, baby, you got one.

Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.

Oh yes he will.

Yeah, well...

Sure. I'd like that.

I got pretty close.

Are you sure?

So you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes?

I know a way. I know how you can get a message out of here.

How do you know?

Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting.

Oh, just some insurance guy.

Speak of the devil.

Oh, please, your life doesn't suck. His life sucks.

He's scum! As far as he's concerned you're just a pair of breasts that talk.

What's it to you?

Call me Charlie.

So have dinner with me tonight.

What?

We? I don't think so.

Oh, I'm not married.

I'll try.

Allez, allez!

It's Tatopoulos.

We have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise.

Last time you didn't even scratch it!

You don't have the authority to do that.

Are you sure? How do you know?

This is America. There is nothing you can not buy.

Well good, that's very... nice.

Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.

Is that the bathroom?

... It has been my greatest honor to serve with you.  LIving by your example these years, my life has had meaning.  I have been blessed.  Sir, I... I...

You'll forgive my impertinence, sir, but even though we had never before met, always considered you as a father to me.

I won't and nothing you say-

COME IN PROTECTOR... PROTECTOR...

Like throwing gasoline on a fire...

DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!

Nothing.

... . Well  you have to figure out what it wants... What's its motivation?

Yes. Good was done this .....

No. I can't go out there! I won't say that ridiculous catch phrase one more time. I won't.  I can't!

Shut up.

I don't know... It just wasn't like him.

All this from watching the.. historical records?

The ships are gaining...

No I didn't.

By Grabthar's Hammer, this is true. 159	NT. LIVING ROOM - SOMEWHERE - NIGHT	159

You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?

We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.

It's okay. Listen-

It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.

Okay, you can go on in... I'm going to get Kyle. He knows the utility tunnel system better than anybody alive.

We'd never have the budget for this.

No,  I am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer, but a matter REARRANGER, converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past.

Okay, now. But-

The enemy is matching velocity.

Right.

We're doing episode 31, Jason?

We should have a turbo. I'm always saying "activate turbo boosters", right?...

Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?

We're doing episode 31?

Where'd they go? Back inside?

Not a clue. You?

We made it. Commander, we made it.'

How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?

You know it's one thing to treat us this way, but how can you do this to your fans?...

One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'

Tell them? About...

Let me think. I need time to think.

JASON...

I don't think that's a cloud...

Nothing. Hold please.

Right.

Because it was on the show!

Closer?  I can try.

I see them!  I see them! RD STREET	PASADENA 57

Please, don't hurt them, it's not their fault. I'm not the Commander, I don't know anything.

This is embarrassing, really.   I shan't tell this story when I return home.

Right, If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure I have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one of these

Catch me later, okay?

Thanks

Wherever a distress signal sounds among the stars, we'll be there, this fine ship, this fine crew. Never give up, never surrender!

NO, Thank God he has not.

But...Why?

Why don't you just turn it on and see?

It's a ROCK. It doesn't HAVE vulnerable spots!

Congress has picked up it's skirts and is racing for Baltimore. They're not waiting for spring!  Of course, they still had time to deny my promotion.  Even John Adams voted against it...

Don't do anything rash, please, Benedict.

The army can survive without me.

No.  I guess.

Yes, my lord.

Many of them, many did not possess proper arms.  My lord.

Lafayette will not be happy...

No one wants to turn the table on the enemy more than I.  But if victory is remote and there's any hope for a negotiated peace, we must keep this army intact.

It's a wonder they find the British cause worth dying for.

Get the body of our army up to Greene's vanguard as fast as we can.  All the damned fool has to do is hit the British rearguard and then hold for us.

Colonel Hamilton.  Anyone who served under Arnold, I want them shipped north.  I don't want any troops here who served under Arnold.

Don't lie to me, Hamilton!  If I had not court-martialed Arnold...

No one knows...

Yes, I believe so.

Lafayette is a child!

It's the political 'cost of doing business', George.

A ground swell-Christian movement, George, you see?

I mean, I'm a Deist.  A belief I share with the likes of Tom Jefferson and Ben Franklin.  Surely you knew that.

I... they look both the same.

I only meant...

Yes, I will write him and tell his ministers and the court.

Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen.

That's when Sally Fairfax was tutoring you...

I think I heard that.

Oh, indeed?  You know very well people are frightened of arming the Negroes!  They beg you to consider the future.  What good is a revolution if it overturns those things we cherish!?

We're leaving them?

Well sir, I was an ironmaster before you got me.  Maybe I will let you down yet.

You wrong me, general; I am an officer and a horse-shoer.

I'm with Captain Hamilton.

You don't believe I can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism?

You've got to stop them here or our whole line will cave-in!  It's all right boys, I'm here!

It is; we need you George.

You know very well who it is that I love.

I remember a pair of young philosophers once, who laughed at the world.

George, I'm sorry.

Except for that, quite like home; England, that is.

Slavers capture them and bring them here.

It's stupid, of course.

The place to want to be is America. Every English child dreams of it. I dreamt it.

Let's get you darker!

I'm lost in ecstasy!  And dost thou love, Thou charming maid?

I see...

God damn you, Sam Adams!  You wanted a revolutionary army and now that we've really got one it scares you more than it does the British!

Yeah, well, this one's the Cadillac of minivans.

Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo.

They all sound big at the talking stage.

I was thinking tonight you could go have a look around Palmer's hotel room while I go check out Karen Flores' place. See if he hasn't stashed it somewhere.

Calm down, Bear...

Hey, he should have a weapon, a knife or something.

No shit? What're some of 'em?

Your who?

I hear he's around Palm Springs. Dealing our product. Product we sold to you for five hundred thousand dollars.  Why do you keep talking to me bullshit? I think maybe I have Ramon and Ceasar staple your tongue to your chin. What do you think?

I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.

With Ilona? You know how old Ilona is?

Yeah, well, we need a ride somewhere, we'll let you know.

What money?

She can't talk right now.

Gimme an hour.

In the can. That the money?

Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.

It was waiting out there on another deal, one that didn't go through; one you don't want to know about.

Okay. So who are you?

Ray. Look at me.

Look at me, Ray.

I told them I was you. I acted stupid and they believed me.

Don't insult me. Get up and turn around.

I don't like waiting.

Whatta you got there... some kinda pop nine, the fuckin' Fiat of guns, always jammin' at the wrong time.

I'm a producer.

I am. I'm a fan of everything that's L.A. I love it out here.

That's what I'd do.  Make sure I got the right guy next time.

Movie producer? Yeah, why not.

I want you to keep looking right here, okay?

You just did.

Or the guy thinks he could get 'em broken. You have to understand the loan shark's in business the same as anybody else. He isn't in it to hurt people. He's in it to make money.

Well, since Leo's name was on the passenger list...

You wouldn't be talking to me if you were.

Who's the star?

His shrink's trainer.

Get the fuck outta my chair.

Yeah, he wants us to talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.

He died.

Personally?

What Get Away jet?

'E.g.' means 'for example', Ray. I think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'

It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional views.

If you'd like to tell me, yeah.

What happened? The pressure got to you?

Like this?

Who told you that?

At eighteen percent, okay? And don't ask me no more fuckin' questions. I'm leaving.

You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine.

Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me?

I know what a vig is.

A hundred and fifty-six. Some'll charge you more'n that, go as high as six for five on a short-term loan. So three a week's not too bad.

How much is the wife offered?

Lemme get this straight, you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before?

Yeah, well make sure you lock it on the way out.

For any movie.

Man, can you scream.

"Cotton".

I just caught the end.

I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.

Sounds fair.

I want to know.

Depends, who pays?

Yeah. There's a girl in it now.

Whichever. Let's talk about it tomorrow.

What happened?

Yeah, Harry, you look like you belong in one of your horror movies.

What's Momo gonna want with an old place, shows old movies people don't care about no more. Outside of maybe turnin' it into a porno house, I don't think he's gonna give much of a fuck. And you already got a job.

How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?

I'm thinking about producing.

You heard me, Pick 'n' Save.

Yeah, me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him. Made him what he was.

No. But now that you mention it, I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day... who just happened to get his hands on the script.

He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.

No problem. You go on off to bed.

He happens to be loaning me five hundred grand, no strings, I write any kind of agreement I want.

Man's in town two days, thinks he's David O. fucking Selznick.

Hello, Martin.

I know. I'm doing Shylock instead of a shylock. Okay, what's my motivation? The acquisition of money. To collect. Inflict pain if I have to.

I'm intrigued, yeah. You know what might help you, take a look at the Cylone again, the way a visual fabric is maintained even while the metaphor plays on different levels. Hey -  This your ride, Chili?

Thanks.

A passenger liner. Over.

Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago. You don't think that's just a little freaky?

Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a piece of metal.

Looks like it took out the backup genny too.

Amidships starboard at the beam. Just under the waterline. I don't think it's a problem.

Ever heard of insurance, big boy?

Yeah, well how the hell you get something like that wrong? That's a damn big boat. It's either sunk or it ain't.

I tell you one thing, we're not gonna be towing no ship now.

Gimme a break.

Oh yeah.

You have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage? The fittings alone could go for a few million.

The damn thing's been floating around for God knows how long and it hasn't hit anything yet. So we take it easy. A little of the old push pull.

What is it?

How long to fix?

What, you think there's something funny about it?

A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself. It's ours.

The sooner we get under way, the sooner we are to spending what's ours.

Yeah, yeah.

Conveniently enough for you.

If money can buy what he wants.

Probably didn't have time.

Because of the gold.

Yeah. Thanks.

You're more practical than superstitious.

Did you see him?

There's somebody else on this boat.

I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.

It wasn't you. It was somebody else. There's somebody else aboard.

I'll call us in. Dodge, see how many signal flares you can scrounge up.  Keep an eye on him.

Same. Any luck?

If they were close enough to shore, they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats.

But, who -- ?

Collision? With what?

But where's the damage?

What's that supposed to mean?

Leave him till we can get some help.  From now on, nobody comes down here.

Could be a stroke. Who knows?  The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. "Like wild dogs."

Maybe it was more than that.

The way I figure it, it was them or me. I thought putting Dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a little time. Made it look like whoever killed those Greeks was still around. But it's just us on this ship. Us and your... spirit friends.

What do you say, Dodge?

Red sky in morning, sailor take warning.

Sorry.

Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million.

It's worth the effort. Believe me. Besides we're gonna need her to prove the salvage.

Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs.

And look what happened.

You don't remember?

Dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins.

The coast guard has our last position. They'll send somebody out soon enough. A ship this size you can't exactly miss.

The mooring hasn't come taught.

Leave it.

Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you got your hearing aid turned down?

You got about two seconds to get your paws off me, Tarzan.

You want fair pay, make hamburger for Mickey D. Otherwise, please to sign.

Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter.  You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to.

How should I know?

Who?

Tell her to forget it - I don't need her help.

Nothing.

But I can't --

Oh -- please - don't let me interrupt finish your phone call.

Well, I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook's Chicken used to be called Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture...

It's complicated... I guess I'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it's hidden, or something...

You can count on me, sir!

But I was only trying to be friendly...

Okay, okay... I won't say a word...

Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.

Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...

Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?

"Yeah, right"... well why not?  What's so wrong with me?

Then why do you hate me so much?

You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.

That's just the way I am!

It's just my stupid way of getting attention! God, I practically love you, Josh!

I couldn't sleep... I should get going; I feel really weird...

It's totally sickening.  Let's see if they gave me the right diploma...

Why?

How perfect.

Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest.

I know, it hasn't really hit me yet.

We should follow them!

You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...

Or maybe not.

Can we call you "Weird Al"?

God, this paper is so boring. Who reads all this shit?  Here we go...  "Windsurfing Doctor, Mensan IQ, maverick Sagittarius. Let's hit the clubs, make each other laugh!"

You lent it to me in like tenth grade.

I remember every minute of that party.

Which loser?

Oh yeah.

It's still twenty-five minutes early.

He's still just sitting there. God, this is totally unbearable!

He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance.

Bingo!

I know... I still can't get over that his name was "Seymour."

I dunno... I kind of like him... He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate... In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool...

Somewhere downtown.

It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it!

Hey, you have to see my new good luck charm.

Wait...

No way... when?

He's a total asshole... He doesn't even need that wheelchair, he's just totally lazy!

We were such desperate sluts back then.

Yeah, thanks.

Go ahead...

I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that...

What are you talking about? Who?

I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.

Actually, he's a really nice guy.

It just came yesterday...

Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.

What are you doing here, Melorra?

Him. Seymour. He's the man with the records.

That tape sucked, by the way!

You're late, asshole.

Did you bring that tape?

God, fuck you!

I don't have anything after about 1935. I may have one Hindu 78 from the twenties in my collection, but it's not really for sale. I don't really collect "foreign."

Nah, it's not so great. Here's the one I'd recommend.

Wow!

A dollar seventy-five.

Good luck...

I appreciate the offer but you really don't --

Well, let's see... I guess I'd have to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and Ragtime music at the top of the list, then probably...

PLEASE? We have to!

Jesus, Seymour.

Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?

I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label.

Look, I really appreciate your help, Enid, but let's face it, this is hopeless.

It doesn't matter, I'm not staying long... I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet.

What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.

Yeah, well "Cook's" is just a made up name. When they originally opened back in 1922 they were named "The Coon Chicken Inn" -- that's an early painting of their first logo.

I dunno... they're very sensitive at work about all this stuff. Maybe it would be better if you --

Are you okay?

Oh... uh... It's just this elastic thing I have to wear for lumbar support...

Maybe now you understand why I can't get a date.

I'm starting to think that even if I did get a girlfriend it really wouldn't change anything.

Oh yeah?

Why?

I won't even dignify that with a response.

Let the machine get it. I have no desire to talk to anyone who would be calling me...

I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy...

Sort of... she doesn't dislike any of that stuff... she's trying, anyway... actually, we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon...

What's her problem anyway?  Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?

I don't think you understand how I really feel about you, Seymour.

I had to see you.

That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!

What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.

At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags!

...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.

I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.

You must know I always... did you really mean all that about moving in with me?

Right.

Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.

Yeah.

It's a tampon in a teacup...

What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?

Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.

Why don't we start with that next week?

Don't thank me. You're doing all the work.

On that I choose to remain dubious.  Two are dead now in two nights. 

How; we don't know where they are?

My wife is the game player in the family, sir.

You don't enjoy killing, do you? 

-please- you needn't be so graphic-

What if there are complications?-

Almost three hours.  But I've been getting ready all my life. 

-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.

What?

So that's what a lion looks like. 

Let me save time-  you are the engineer;  you are in charge;  you're sorry I'm here. Right so far?  Good- because  I am not an engineer,  I don't want to be in charge, and  I'm sorrier than you are that I'm here- I hate Tsavo. So I will help you by killing the lions and leaving, and you will help me by doing what I tell you so I can leave. See any problems?

No, but you do-  -see, you were needed after all.  And fifty warriors at the camp before dawn.

It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.

Not for me- I'm too bulky and it's your idea, you go up there.  Take the others to the water tower for the night.

Yes. And I'll be in some distant tree where I can provide no assistance whatsoever.  Can you control your fear?

You think they'll come then?  Why?

Because they are here.  Because Tsavo is the worst place in the world.  Come, John- to the bridge. 

This is more difficult-

Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad?

Thank you, Samuel.

I expect so- it's from my wife.

I don't believe you had a mother. 

Because I have two plans to kill the lions- one involving the cattle, the other the men.

Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?

No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway.

Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha.

No harm will come to the child.  You might even say it's a privilege.  He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo.  And you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.  Doesn't that sound nice?

I'm not saying you did.  In science we always look for the simplest explanation.

Do you ever see him?

Does he ever mention me?

Okay, that's no problem.

Unusual?  I don't know.  I haven't had a lot of experience with babies.

I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.

As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell you that I haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case.

Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?

It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.

For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?

Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know.

A little to the left.  Right there!  That's where it stopped.

No, you can't, and I think that's the whole problem with aliens; you just can't trust them. You may get some nice ones occasionally like Starman or E.T., but most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard.  Anyway, we're just about out of time.  Next week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless pets.  Until then, this is Peter Venkman saying ...  ... Good night.

No, that's what I want to talk to the mayor about.  We did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued, screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you.

Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?

So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a beautiful princess came to live with them.

Okay.

How are you?  What's that you're working on, Johnny?

Oh, Johnny.  Did you back the wrong horse.

Command me, lord.

-- the sorrow --

I await the word of Vigo.

Lord Vigo, the mother, Dana, is fine and strong.  I was wondering -- well, would it be possible -- if I bring the baby, could I have the woman?

Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that I can't resist.

Maybe they just want to appeal.

I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.

Objection.  Irrelevant and immaterial.

Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many holes already we didn't think anyone would notice.

Yeah, you would.  Is that for personal or professional reasons?

This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman. It's hot and it's ready to pop.

Why don't we try the Giga-meter?

That's it.  It's on the bottom.

Butt out, you pencil-necked geek.  I've had it with you.

Oh, hiya, Pete.

It's an interesting one, Pete.  If anything was going on it's totally subdued now.

This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman. A psychoreactive substance!  Whatever this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states.

Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say supportive, nurturing things --

Nothing.  Just some mood-slime residue in and around the bathtub.  But we did turn up some interesting stuff on this Vigo character you mentioned.  I found the name Vigo the Carpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians, Martyrs and Madmen.  Listen to this:

We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along.

I hate Jello.

Oh, right, you told me that.  They came to America seeking other kinds of cheese, as I recall.  How about you, Winston?

I'm ready.

Yeah, but what a ride.  You can't make a hamburger without chopping up a cow.

Now if you don't want to be the --  -- fifth person ever to die in meta-shock from a planar rift, I suggest you get down behind that desk and don't move until we give you the signal "Stabilize -- All Clear."

Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.

And decent.

It's okay.  I have my Senior Lifesaving card.

It is a star!  That's great.  You're very good.

No.  They're just coming to me.

Fine, Louis.  We'll stop in for a drink.

Barrett.  Dana Barrett.

Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?

Out!

Then leave.

The "stiff?"  He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man.

Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.

Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?

Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.

I am Zuul.  I am ...

There is no Dana.  I am Zuul.

Back off, man!  I'm a scientist!

Is that a game?

I collect spores, molds and fungus.

Here are tonight's calls.

Did you ever report it to anyone?

Are you Peter Venkman?

Forget it, Venkman.  You had your chance to cooperate but you thought it was more fun to insult me.  Now it's my turn, smart-ass.

Probably a mixture of gases, no doubt stolen from the Army ...

Yes.  I don't like this.

You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?

They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.

I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.

I'm always serious.

We'd better adjust our streams.

Neutronize.  System shut.

Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff.  You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience.  And what have you seen?

Uh-huh.  I've heard about the rockfall, Ray. I think you've been spending too much time with Spengler.

What do I say?

If anyone deserves it, it's Spengler and me. We're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment.

Good idea.  Were any other words spoken that you remember?

No sense worrying about it now.

Where are you, Pete?

Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.

And the seas would boil ...

Right.  We'll believe anything.

We're nearly there, Lucilla.

Will you please get back in your wagon?  And stay there?

Why not do it in the Colosseum?

Taking my pleasure.  Do I need to clear my lovers with you?

You can't do that... listen to the mood of the crowd.

Not yet, dear brother...

Respectfully Caesar, Quintus and I must report.

That's difficult to say, general.

Oh, but with the army behind you, you could become extremely political.  Not a Republican by any chance?

Do we really need to repair this fort?  It seems like an expensive undertaking.  I propose we burn it to the ground.  That way if the Germans cross the Danube here there will be nothing to help them build an offensive position.

You flatter me, Caesar.

We have to stop the Germans now!

Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate.  I could have executed you.

If you set me free I will find my way back to the army, march on Rome and depose you.  Then, the army and I will restore the Republic so that animals like you will never control human destinies again.

Until your confirmation date.

We can crush Gaius another way. What if you do throw something to the people they really want?  Make them a gift of food.

Sacks of grain, even bread.  I own the grain licenses for the military, I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube.

Narcissus will never support you, Caesar, he has too much of a philosophical temperament.

I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?

Fools to let us both live; we'll be our own best witnesses at our trial.

They can't... if this is Rome...

Only from a distance.

Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.

I'll do anything in my power to help you restore the Republic but I can't be that power.

The 'people'?, listen to the people, they know what they want:  A government that gives them what they need and doesn't bother them with messy thoughts of issues.  You know, messy... thinking.  They want a dictator!  As far as the children, there is only one thing that every Roman child dreams of:  being you! A famous gladiator!

I never knew a more idealistic man than you.

I don't even want to imagine the things you've seen...

No!

You are to be killed, exactly. They'll give you a sporting chance, but just enough to make your murder... entertaining.  Romans like to mix their metaphors:  laughter with their executions, you know?  If you survive, though, you will become a gladiator.  A gladiator at least gets a fair fight.

Chain him.

Don't be ridiculous.

Make us rich, Proximo, make us very rich...

What the hell are you talking about, Greek?

As, what, 'The Galloping Gladiator?!'

You were a soldier, and then a gladiator, weren't you?

Yes.

No.

I'd love some.

No.

No.

Wait a minute.

I don't know. They must think I look like this guy Gladstone.

It just happened. It was just this thing that happened along with everything else. Can you understand that?

Because I wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to!

Because I want to know what's happening.

GET OUT!

I've got a real feeling that this is the fellow.

All right then! Yes!

What did she say?

But Elaine --

What?

I don't know.

I just don't think it would...

No.

What?

Thank you.

Yes, sir.

There is a great future in plastics. Think about it. Will you think about it?

I said -- not exactly -- no.

What?

Oh -- no sir.

Who screamed?

Look -- she's all right. She's upset and she screamed. But she's okay now.

You heard me. Out of here.

I am going to call the police now.

Yes.

Could you bring it up?

For God's sake, Benjamin, will you stop acting that way and bring me the purse?

What? Oh -- no -- I'm just --

A single. Just for myself, please.

What? No. Nothing.

I mean I'd -- I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. I just have a toothbrush. I can get it myself. If that's all right.

No.

What?

What?

Look -- I drove you home. I was glad to do it. But I have some things on my mind. Can you understand that?

No.

What do you mean?

Look -- I think I should be going --

What?

So?

Sit down.

We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.

Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?

Yes.

We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?

Oh. Well, goodnight.

I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.

Right.

I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.

What if he did?

Would you like me to seduce you?

Oh. Hello. Hello.

Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.

Why don't I get it? Well -- I will then.  If you'll excuse me.

That's fine.

What?

Either one will be fine.

This is all terribly wrong.

Wait a minute.

Well?

Don't you?

Neither.

Your husband! Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about.

I mean everything. I don't know anything about how you -- how you work this. I don't know how you get out of the house at night. I don't know the risk involved.

I walk out.

Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.

What?

Calm down, Benjamin.

Can I undress and talk at the same time?

No we don't.

No.

Art.

Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?

I don't think we were the first.

What?

It was a Ford, Benjamin.

Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.

Benjamin?

Of course you did.

Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.

Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.

But if it's sickening for you --

Thank you.  Benjamin --

Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.

Listen to me very carefully, Benjamin. You are not to see Elaine again. Ever. Those are my orders. Is that clear?

Where is Elaine?

Goodnight, sir.

When I go off?

What else?

Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?

Benjamin, I'm not going to pry into your affairs, but I'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin.

Not if you don't want to.

Goodnight, Benjamin.

I do.

Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --

About what?

You got me.

Standing guard over the old castle, are you?

Oh no.

No. No -- I'm just -- I'm just a little worried about my future. I'm a little upset about my future.

I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben --

Oh no.

Oh yes.

No, it's not --

You don't respect me terribly much either, do you?

Don't shout at me, Ben.

It's Benjamin.

Could I speak to you for a second, Dad?

Dad -- can you listen --

Your bank, Mr. Kringelein.

Every glass high to life -- the splendid, dangerous, mighty, brief -- brief life -- and the courage to live it.  Baron, you know -- I've only lived since last night -- but that little while seems longer than all the time before -- all the -- 

The pearls are in her room.

No.

How?

That.

No -- why? -- should I?

Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought herself?

Where downstairs?

All right. We'll dance.

Chasing what?

Yesterday -- yes -- that was yesterday.

I thought that, too -- but I found that it does. Come along, dance with Kringelein.

Yes --

Nerves -- just nerves. You must forgive me. I have had a bad evening. I am very tired. Do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence?

I'd like to smoke a cigarette.

A man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you.

I saw you just now -- then I saw you cry -- and now I see you in the mirror -- Grusinskaya...

You are beautiful!

I'm a gambler -- I'm running at large like a happy pig, devouring anything of life that pleases me, I really belong in jail

Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night.

Oh -- yes but -- later.

Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave?

Don't worry. I'll be on the train.  He leaves.

Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- A Louisiana flip?

Ready, Baron.

All of that at once, Baron?

Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me, Baron.

That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You know him?

I must have made a mistake.

Look here, sir -- I'm completely at your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death -- I had to get some money -- tonight.

No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought. 

No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.

No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't let it interfere with my duty. Any news here?

No, Doctor.

No, Doctor.

No, doctor.

The Grand Hotel.

I'll take the bank -- All right, gentlemen.

Silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are, too.

Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, Miss Flaemm, won't you have something sweet -- a Louisiana flip.  A Louisiana flip.

Yes.

For the first time in my life, I'm happy.

You don't like to see me enjoying myself.

Quick -- something awful -- awful has happened. Go -- go at once, -- Mr. Preysing --

Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.

I didn't like Preysing right off.

What?

Moreover --

Moreover...

I got ten marks for that.

Me.

Should throw a great weight into the balance...

Definitely off.

Hello!

I must speak to you, Miss Flaemm -- business.

You mean Baron von Gaigern?

Here, hold up!

You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen. I can't make you out.

Exactly.

We have a good many connections in England, naturally.

Since, on the eleventh of June, this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger between our respective firms was entered into -- both parties have fully agreed that this merger can result only in mutual advantages.

Gentlemen, I am now free to announce...  ...that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated.

Foggy -- frightfully foggy, always, I'm told.  Have you said anything about Manchester, Mr. Preysing?

Thank God we're beginning at the beginning.

We did not approach you.

He likes to play the great man.

It will pass -- it will pass -- come.

Send it away -- I shan't need it.

Good morning, Madam.

Oh, yes, Suzette.

Five minutes, Suzette, come back in five minutes. I'll ring.

Goodnight, Suzette.

Where is Pimenov? Where is Pimenov? 

The house is not full -- Is it really full?

There was -- there was.

Yes, Pimenov.  One minute, Suzette, I will call you.

Does that mean that the bath is my own? --- Private?

I could not think of not accepting.

Do you think you have free license to be insulting? Believe me you have not. You think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man.

Me?

-- We must do something...

The scandal -- we are men -- you -- you could take that affair of the young lady upon yourself -- take her and hold your tongue. Then you can travel -- I'll give you anything -- anything -- she was with you.

No, I won't wait -- I can't -- Every day is precious -- every hour -- Every minute.

When she gets her paint on and hears the music -- she'll be all right. I know these people.

I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.

Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation?

Well -- gentlemen.

Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head.

Zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty?

Did I buy you that dress, you piece of shit?

You work for me, huh? Then I just may flush you down the toilet. Drive me to the Durando.

Bobo, no, I --

My son was in the hospital --

On the square, huh? And how are you making out these days? Stealing much?

A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo?

I will. So long, Bobo.

I like you, too.

Fine.

Goody!

We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately.

These machines -- They're in here.

What? He's going to be all right!

Well, make it stop!

You know who I work for.

Why? What's wrong?

But what's wrong?

What is?

I'll get you a check.

Just myself.

I don't know offhand what your best year's been, we can look it up. The idea is, we'll top it by fifteen percent.

No?

They twisted my arm.

I guess I owe you my life.

My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore. When a long shot gets too much action, I have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down.

You don't have the stomach for it.

That's right.

We won't hit the track. The beach. Couple a nice restaurants.

I pay my debts.

I've really got to --

As though you do what I say.

You've already made a start. Doesn't look that clean, though.

I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.

Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different.

A future. The only future I've got.

I have to have that money, Roy. What do I have to do to get it?

My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.

This time...

Always, for you, baby.

Taking you for granite?

Are you sure?

Oh, yeah?  Thanks.  How long do they say I'm in here?

I want to know everything about you.

Oh, don't be stupid.

Join up with you! I watched you, Roy, I've been watching you, wondering if I should talk about this at all, or maybe just... 

Sure.

I called a fellow I know in Tulsa, the one who plays my chauffeur. There's a sucker there he says is made for us. And a boroker that just shut down, we can use their office, not change a thing! Now, I can scrape up ten grand without much trouble. That leaves fifteen or twenty for your end. We could start this weekend, get the sucker into position --

What?

You're too good for the small-time, Roy. Move up to where there's big dough to be made, and you don't have to stick your neck out every day.

For Christ's sake, why not?

I'm wise to you, I should have seen it before, you rotten son of a bitch. How is it, huh? How do you like --

Well, mostly, I don't believe it.

Gun?

It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide.

Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem. It's just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock.

No question, huh?

Oh, yeah. That's that.

It's for your cigarette.  I prefer not to contaminate my crime scene with micropollutants.

That don't match either of the victim's.

The cemetery...

Do I know you?

I'd prefer you didn't.  I'm very busy.

Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing.

What the fuck are you talking about?

No shit.

You're so predictable.

Forget it.

Nothing.

I just went for a walk.  It's no big deal.

Well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends.

Just get on the bus.

Where'd you get it?

Why not?

Then you come out here.

Okay... thank you.

Looks great.  It does.

It's not going to happen.

I'm fine.  I just need to lie down...

I did alright.

He gave me a fuckin' A?  Wow.

I thought you were allergic to latex.

But the dance is in the gymnasium.

Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the Strode house.

He's in the bathroom.

Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my sister?

The voice man!  He's here!

The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here.

Danny, you're just going to have to wait!

You'll never pass that exam on an empty stomach, Kara.

Who are you?

Jamie?  But I thought she was --

It's ... Michael ...  ... Michael Myers!

Danny, go downstairs -- Now!

Wait a minute ...

That's the whole idea of living in the country.  I thrive on the seclusion.

Jamie's baby ...

Stay away, Sam.

I know he's alive.  People in this town -- they want us to believe he's dead.  But I know. I've always known.

Home.  Jesus.  I'm like this.  Home!

Must have changed that law.

You know what gets me?

This room is full of ghosts.

Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all I care.

Go home!

I'm certainly not going to come horning back into your life tomorrow, and I will not welcome your horning back into mine.  A chapter has ended.  We are old comrades--at a parting of the ways.

First Nagasaki--now this.

What's this?

In what way, pray tell?

Tit for tat--as simple as that.

You did?

Everybody thinks that.

For seven and a half of those years we were heavily drugged--or we would have been home long before now, believe me.  We were saved from starvation by the Lupi-Loopo Indians, who fed us a strange blue soup.

I'd rather go to Viet Nam.

I just want one true adventure before I die.

Out!

Thank God!

I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my mind.  If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much.  When did you know my father?

Everybody says he was so brave.

He worships Father.

Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.

He was a stretcher-bearer in the Korean War.  Were you in a war with Father?

Dad was never in England?

Tell me that.

Tell me that!  Tell me that!

I wanted to go out for football, but Mom was afraid I'd get hurt.

She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.

I can't take my eyes off you.

Penelope!

Damn.

Your mother and I do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours.

Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?

We've got to do something to make this boy's voice change.  I wonder if we couldn't get bull balls somewhere, and fry 'em up.  Still miss your mother?

What's this?

I'm talking to you gently now.

How do you do, Mrs. Ryan?  I'd heard you were beautiful, and so you are.  Am I intruding here?

I don't know.  This is a new disease to me.

Situation.

Have some.

I could carve a better man out of a banana!

You and your damned bedside manner and your damned little black bag full of miracles.  You know who filled that bag for you?  Not Alice-sit-by-the-fires like yourself.  Men with guts filled it, by God--men with guts enough to pay the price for miracles--suffering, ingratitude, loneliness, death--

A trip, you mean?

What a honeymoon.

Well, I can.  Some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me.  I'm not a silly carhop any more.  Maybe you're right about fish. When I was a carhop, I didn't feel much more than a fish would.  But I've been sensitized.  I have ideas now--and solid information.  I know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you.

Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there.

And they have very mixed feelings about women.  They hate them in a way.  One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently.  They can scrog them, as you say--  for revenge.

If he wants to go.

It's a big and busy funeral home.

I'm dying to hear of his reaction. The thrill of smashing something isn't in the smashing, but in the owner's reactions.

About a broomstick and a cigar box--and the attenuated intestines of an alley cat.

How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.

He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.

Sounds quite beautiful.

If he thinks he's man enough.

There has to be a threat of some sort, nobility of some sort, glamour of some sort, sport of some sort.  These elements are lacking.

Of course he can go--if he'll just go down on his hands and knees for a moment--and promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree.

Oh dear.

I've got to run!

A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab.

Are--are you crying, Penelope?

What next?  You leave promptly, of course.  There is no question as to whose home this is--

This little corpse is intended as a lesson?

Oooooo.  That hurt.

Comical?

You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.

Poison.

And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.

More clowning!  Don't you see?

Man, as man was meant to be--a vengeful ape who murders.  He will soon be extinct.  It's time, it's time.

For what it's worth now, Harold Ryan, the clown, gives his sacred word.

Colonel Harper, retired now, dropped an atom bomb on Nagasaki during the Second World War, killing seventy-four thousand people in a flash.

You don't know?

Jesus.

Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, "Guess who?" She conked right out.

What will you do, Colonel?

Thought you were another wife, maybe.

I heard you were looking for me.

Do I have to?  Who's the little girl?

Premature ejaculation.

Ja?

And I wish you'd quit touching me all the time.  It drives me nuts!

Explain it to them.  I'm bugging out of here.

Men can touch other men, and it doesn't mean a thing.  Haven't you ever seen football players after they've won the Superbowl?

Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?

You're married!  You've already got a husband!

How did she lose her feet?

I was afraid to ask.

It's beautiful.

It is you, isn't it, Harold?

He can hardly talk.

Then get him.

Oh?

A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.

How's the fungus around your thumbnail?

It's jungle rot!  This room is making everybody sick!  This is your family doctor speaking now.  Here--I brought you something else to hang on your wall, for the sake of variety.

That's something I suppose.

If you'll pardon the expression, that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly.  Good night.

Beautiful!  I've never seen that coat.

How long has this been going on?

You're saying no.

Take plenty of cigars.

No doubt Paul thinks it stinks.

That's not true either--or needn't be, unless we make it true.

Which we do.  But we can stop doing that.

You're preparing him for a career in the slaughterhouses of Dubuque?  Take care of your body, yes!  But don't become a bender of horseshoes and railroad spikes.  Don't become obsessed by your musculature.  Any one of these poor, dead animals here was a thousand times the athlete you can ever hope to be. Their magic was in their muscles. Your magic is in your brains!

What a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage.

You bet! "The Harold Ryan Fan Club." Pink, eh?  With a yellow streak up the back.  We got very good tailor shops up here.  They'll make you any kind of uniform, any kind of sweatsuit you want.  Judas Iscariot--he's got this black jacket with a skull and crossbones over the heart.  He walks around all hunched over, and he never looks anybody in the eye, and written on the back of his jacket are the words, "Go take a flying--

I don't really want... 'body to body contact.'

What do you mean, not the type? Don't you know who I am? I'm Big Dick Brown! I've been in more porno movies than you ever saw. I've worked with Harry Reems. I've worked with Johnny Wad. Not the type! I can come ten times a day. I can keep it hard two hours at a time. My cock is nine inches long.

Well, I want to...

You're not Vice, are you?  Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?

Are you going to stiff me?

Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I don't get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my money on tips.

Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.

I said I just wanted to talk to you...

...about this woman.  I'm trying to find her. Do you know her?

Overpowering?

Yes. I think it'll look better.

You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.

She thinks so.  What do you do?

Sure. Like in Mikey and Niki. Did you see that picture?

Do you know where she lives?

Last I heard he went to San Diego.

Three hundred?

I'll give you $700 a week, cash, if you help me find this girl.

Half now, half later.

I am.

Her name is Kristen. She disappeared a couple of months ago.

She's dead.

You don't understand shit.

Tijuana.

Christian Reformed. It's a Dutch Calvinist denomination.

They believe in the 'TULIP.'

So it's already worked out. The fix is in?

If you see anything from the inside it makes sense. You ought to hear perverts talk. A guy once almost had me convinced to let his dachshund fuck me.

Where does he live.

On your own land?

Yeah.  She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out?

Don't get upset. I lied too. I don't make no five hundred dollars a week. Everything I make goes to Granville.

Mr. Van Dorn?

What do you mean?

Hmm.

Do you think she's safe?

You like this, don't you. Showing me... this.

Like what?

Does she know anything about this?

Just leave me alone.

No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get over to the office.

Wes, Anne, come here a moment.

Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.

What is going on?

It was called 'Slave of Love.'

Where does he hang out?

Good.

I want to know where my daughter is. Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She's with you.

Who?

I don't know nothing, man.

No.

It's cool. Why do you think I got in the movies? How much poon do you think you get in the car wash business?  Look, fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy. You can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for fifty thousand dollars. So why fuck with the movie business?

Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?

You never heard of that?

Well, each time he comes in closer, like this.

He didn't look good at all. Something strange is going on. He's got himself into some trouble. He wouldn't say what.

I also want you to protect my brother- in-law.

My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica.

'Was.' He and that shitheel Ratan went down to T-J. Maybe I shouldn't say that. Anyway, I hear he's back in Frisco now.

No.

Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?

Hello.

You too, Buster. Stand over here. Lady, you're in a heap of trouble. I have you down here for several violations; speeding, resisting arrest, driving without a license, driving a stolen vehicle, possession of a stolen tree... Where's the tree?

Where are the papers?

Not very.

I'm in charge of all the invoices for the southwest. We supply, for example, most of the egg farmers in Southern California. So you can imagine.

Harrison. Harrison Feed and Grain... At Hamilton and Fourth... I'm in charge of the invoices... And I type up the schedule for the trucking fleet...

Eh, could I have my pen back now, please?

Oh, so do I. They're such fun, aren't they? It's all change. All revolving. Burials and births. The end to the beginning and the beginning to the end -  - the great circle of life. My, this old thing handles well. Ever drive a hearse, Harold?

Your hearse?

Oh.

Thank you, but I really have to go.

Oh, it's fine. Fine.

Yes. Very much.

Oh. Eh, I like it.

Sterling silver. It was my dear mother-in-law's, part of a dinner set of fifty pieces. It's one of the few things that survived.  Oh, but I do rattle on so. Tell me about yourself, Harold.  What do you do when you aren't visiting funerals?

Because they are all the same.

But we can't just dig it up!

What is that he's working on?

Well, I really don't drink...

Some nuts? Some licorice? It has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait.

But I don't play anything.

Superb.

The old double U-turn. Gets them every time.

Me!  When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. "The wisest," he said, "the truest, the most instructive words for all men at all times." Frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - "And this too shall pass away."  Well, the wise man was right - if you remember that, you can't help but live life fully.

How ingenious! Tell me about them.

Pray? No.  I communicate. 

Boy! It sure has been a wonderful day. And you - you are beautiful.

Shall I drop by tomorrow?  Oh, I have a luncheon date. With this girl.

I've never met her. My mother set it up.

Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.

Maude.

Harold, that picture is almost twenty-five years old.

Well, not <u>dying</u>, actually. I'm changing. You know, like from winter to spring. Of course, it is a big step to take.

Harold!

No, thank you. They stain my fingers.

An accurate number would be difficult to gauge.

Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?

Yes. What kind of things do you do?

Yes.

I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff.

To kill. The taste of blood in your mouth.

ZAT!

Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.

Oh sure.

Yes.

Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.

Oh, yes. How did you like that?

No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.

Julia.

No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It SHOULD'VE been a trick!

I'm a girl who keeps her promises.

You a doctor, too?

What's the matter with her?

What?

Hey, so for it. Don't let pity stop you. I'm down. Nail me.

Yeah. The things you were talking about.

Are you crazy?

Kyle, you don't have...

No. Don't let it. You've come this far.

It's you! You HAVEN'T always been as you are. You were HUMAN. Remember. Remember all your confusions. Think!

Oh, pardon me. I obviously didn't convey my hesitation to take his story at face-value. No, YOU talk to me. But -- do me a favor? -- none of this DEMONS crap.

Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough --

Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.  "Unique." That's a word you'll hear quite a bit around here.

Nah. I'll be around, Red, just back in the field.

Noooo! Noooo!!!

Anung-un-Rama...

My job.

Not from you.

Alone?

No. Not this time, H.B. It's been months since I've had an episode. And you know what? I'm learning to control it.

No. Myers is taking me.

Oh, okay then. Maybe later then.

Marco...

Doesn't sounds like him.

What -- ?

What?

-- Section fifty-one. Step back.

Look, do you want the bed in or not?

It's just a puzzle box.

You solved the box. We came. Now you must come with us. Taste our pleasures.

No tears please. It's a waste of good suffering.

No. That wasn't the deal.

Stay the fuck away from me.

I have to speak to my father.

One last time. Give me the box.

That's right. This is Frank you're talking to, remember? FRANK.

That's right. Who are you?

Forget him.

Who are you?

His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.

Good.

What kind of doors?

And you came back here to solve the puzzle --

And the blood let you out?

Oh my God.

He won't complain. He can pay off some of his creditors.

So what's the argument?

He's BEEN here. There's stuff in the kitchen. He must have made a hasty exit.

It looks like a bomb's dropped.

Just feeling a bit sick.

O.K.

Kirsty.

No. I'll do it.

Please.

There's a first time for everything.

That's right.

Yeah, why don't I?

Maybe I will.

Steve.

I said: I found a room.

Well come over, will you? See the place?

What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture --

Call me tomorrow.

You like?

Sure.

I've forgotten.

Never better. You sleep well.

Gone?

No. It's all over.

Just upstairs.

I thought we'd lost you.

Please. I want to see you home. All right?

Are you alright ?

Just trying to get my apartment in order.

As long as you don't mind the smell of fur --

Don't let them take me, Steve --

Will you GO, damn you?

I hate to quibble with you Rob, but she married her first boyfriend. Kevin Bannister.

Say it.

Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?

Oh, so what's the point then?

He offended me with his terrible taste.

Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?

Ha.

Suck my ass.

You are not in a band, Barry.  You are not a musician.  And no posters.

That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. But --

How many tickets can I put you down for?

Whatever.  Okay. "Tell Laura I Love Her." That'd bring the house down. Laura's mom could sing it.

What?

What do you think?  Dick likes it.

I owe it to myself to go right to the edge, Rob, and this group does exactly that.  Over the edge, in fact.

That's what we want.  Reaction.  And if Laura's bourgeois lawyer friends can't take it, then fuck 'em.  Let 'em riot, we can handle it.  We'll be ready.

Do not get ahead of yourself.

Nothing.  I just prefer the other one.

You can be and are wrong.

Nobody.

Anna Moss.  Mossy.  The Mossy Thing. The Swamp Thing.  Is she all green and furry?

Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --

The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street is in his executive suite.  Do you have an appointment?

I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.

So.  Is now a good time?

Can I go home and work this out and let you know?  In a week or so?

Uh...yes, at the moment.

Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.

There's been a rash of them, recently. I find it a little unnerving.  In fact Marco called a few months back, and he wanted to see me, and rehash the past as they say, and I wasn't really up for it.  Do all men go through this?

Well, I'll just make it for you.

The new Belle and Sebastian.  Like it?

-- FUCK OFF!

It's Vince and Justin.

You look upset.

Maybe I should talk to him.

We've noticed and we're glad.  But, you know... how are we going to make peace here?  We want to make things easier for you.  What can we do? Obviously I know how special Laura is, and I know things can't be good for you at the moment.  I'd hate it if I lost her.  But I'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want to see me anymore, I'd respect that decision.  Do you see what I'm saying?

We won't leave it, Ian.  Not ever.

I dunno.

I thought I could give you a lift back.

Well, I liked you.  You were a deejay, and I thought you were hot, and I didn't have a boyfriend, and I wanted one.

Yeah, sure.  More so then than I am now.  That's life though, isn't it?

And do you like it that way?

Don't you think there are more important things to talk about than my record collection?

I think you know that.

Good.  So.  Is it my job?

So we have a chance of getting back together again.

Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?

Well the answer is that I don't know either.  We haven't done it yet.

Will you please just go?

No, not -- I mean have you, you know --

Nothing.

You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at.  But I already knew you could make me laugh.  It's everything else I don't know about.

I'm sorry to go on about it.  But, I don't know, there's a lesson here somewhere, and I want to make sure you get it.

You're being deliberately obtuse.

Sure.  I'll see you on Friday.

Uh... No.

I didn't mess things up because I was scared.  I slept with Ray because I was sick of you.  And I needed something to snap me out of it.

I lived with you.  You were my partner just a few weeks ago and now you're worried I might kill you, and you're entitled to worry.  Isn't that a terrible thing?  Isn't that sad?

Ray's a disaster.  I don't know what that was all about, except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade, I guess, and blow it all apart.

Look, we're okay now.  We just had a nice time.  Let's leave it at that.

Hey, great idea.  What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way.

But it wasn't supposed to be like this.  When I met you we were the same people and now we're not, and...

But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?

You're being stupid.

Hi.  What are you doing?

And the "triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon?" "Triumphant?" "Return?"

Barry?  Barry knows about this?

That's okay.  You seem pissed off all the time, though.

I mean it.

Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?

Fair enough.

It's gonna be fine.  These people are ready for anything.

Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --

Yeah, I know the Crumblers!  I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it.  My everything changed for a couple of weeks.

Exactly!  Fucking ex-actly!

I'd better go.  I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'.

God, you ask a lot of questions.

How's the store?

Your lucky Laura's doing so well. If it wasn't for her, I don't think either of us would ever sleep...

Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?

It's the best collection I've ever seen.

I know what they're worth.  Give me fifty and get them out.

Go to hell.

The boy _died_?

Carl Smith.

It's quite rare you know, some- thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years.

I think you do.  Better yet, I don't think anything was stolen because nothing was there in the first place. And I think Mr. Smith, whoever he is, now knows that.

I've been to Church Hill.

I doubt that.  Good day, Miss Cartwright.

Not your concern.

Are you?

Richard Taupin has become cumbersome.  It would be best if he just disappeared.

Yes.

It's beautiful.

You won't.

What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction.

That's insane.

Of bodies.

You killed those other two.

Come here, Brenna.

I'm the last.  Oh Christ, I'm the _last one_!

No!

I'm just curious.

It'll never stick.

What's all of this got to do with me?

I'll take care of that Corey, but I need this now.

It's that important?

Some job.  Card filing and cabinet dusting.  Four years in this dump and I haven't written anything for Wilson that a wounded yak couldn't do.

Not who.  What.  Worstick's a town in Pennsylvania.

I've seen nobleman swords that weren't as well preserved.  It's just a hunk of peasant iron.  Why would he be carrying it around in an alley?

Your name is Conor?

Please go to no trouble.

And but for a mark you are well as any man, no?

And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.

First food, no?  A good meal makes conversation so much easier.

Yes.  Always.

No!

It is always less with my living. Far or near.  But if I were to die the push would become stronger than ever before.  There is power in this.  And as long as you and I live, The Knight can never have it all.

We are brothers.  And you are a defense-  -of sorts.

All living things pay dues, Conor.  They must be respected for that.

I feel hardly nothing.

I am not ready for this.

What are you saying?  I'm standing here as real as you.

Like you.

Certainly not me.

Romirez is dust.

I had no choice.

Won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon.  Looks good though. They found the receipt in his townhouse.  It was pretty smeared but had Taupin's father listed as a signatory.

He knows I'm here.  How?

Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.

Offered the Pope one of his whores.

You're wrong.

Not so long.

It's all we have.

Leave her alone.

American.

I presume it's a sword.

Your murder weapon?

I only just heard of Conor.  I came up from Catroch as soon as I could.

When may I expect the cleaners?

I should say not! That was one swell story you had in the paper this morning.

Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you.

He certainly -- hic -- does!

Oh, no. How could you ever think of such a thing?

The Criminal Courts Building.

Hello, Bruce...

Bruce, you know I'm mad about you and stop talking like that.  Walter!

Thank you.

Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.

I don't think she'll need you very much -- I aim to do most of the protecting myself.

That'll be nice. A home with mother. A real honeymoon. In Albany, too. Ow!

Well, you'll take care of her. After all, if that doctor's right, I'm going to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. She had it coming to her, but she was too independent.

Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years. By that time, you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything. But suppose you haven't made good -- don't you think Hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries?

No, Bruce, you didn't come between us. It was all over for her before you came on the scene. For me -- it'll never be over.

Oh, sure.  Well, thanks for everything.

Oh.  I wonder what's keeping mother? She was supposed to come down and get you.

You'll ask me to what?

Oh, you did! Well, that's very, very interesting. This happens to be the gun that Earl Williams shot his way out with!

You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff.

Oh, trying to frame me, eh! I never saw this woman before in my life!

Give me the District Attorney's office.  I'll tell you what you'll be doing -- making brooms in the State penitentiary.  Hello, D'Arrasty! This is Hartwell. Come over to my office, will you? I've just arrested a couple of important birds and I want to take their confessions.

You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it.

Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between us nothing can change.

I know, Walter, but I --

You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been doll-faced!

Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter.

You -- you --

Dead?

I know you, Hildy, and I know what it would mean. It would kill you.

Where'd you meet this man?

Now you got me.

Oh, I'm sorry.

How do you like that? Here I am being nice to you and your sweet-heart and that's the thanks I get!

I might have, Walter, but you were never there.

You see what I had to put up with? She never trusted me! You argue with her -- otherwise you're going on a honeymoon with blood on your hands!

Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.

Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.

No kidding, Hildy.  Say, this isn't a rib?

Oh, get off that trapeze!  There's your story! Smear it all over the front page -- Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post! And take all the credit -- I covered your story for you and I got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now I'm getting out! I know I told you that twice before today -- but this time I mean it!

Let me get at that typewriter and I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write!

You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.

Where's some paper?

Where's Butch?

Hildy, you think I could? After this story?  Here! You're just nervous.

Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.

Hello -- Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup?

Come here. See if we can move it.

Will you come here?

What is it? Here!

Yes! What are you afraid of Hildy? I dare him to move that desk out of here.

Uh-uh. As long as we were in there together pitching -- they couldn't lick us. Well, it's been a lot of fun.

That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.

Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.

Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --

What's the difference? I'm going to write that story -- and you know it!

Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!

Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven help me!

No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming.

Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.

A fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! And that other honeymoon in a coal mine!

Walter!

Sure, Heaven! You've probably thought up another coal mine to send me down in -- to get a new story for your paper!

They can't do that to me!

Me, too.

Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me.

Well, it wasn't exactly that way --

Mollie, drop down here! You've fainted!

Aw, why don't you let her alone? She's ill!

What's the use? I can't win a pot.

The Crime Commission has offered a reward of ten thousand dollars for Williams' capture.

Something smells around here. If you ask me Mollie gave her the story on how Williams got that gun.  Did you smuggle that gun into Williams, Mollie?

Probably goin' out to get Williams.

Little rum in yours, too?

I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission.

Oh, that'll be all right, Hildy. Go ahead, run it. And you can say I treated him well, too.  'Lo, Earl. How are you feeling?

What do I know about Williams?

What?

The names are Merwyn D. Mayor, who is the Mayor's brother-in-law --

Howard Shenken, the Sheriff's uncle on his mother's side --

Where he used to live. You can catch the Riot Squad -- it's just going out.

You're certainly a hard fellow to find, Sheriff.

That's good, because my health ain't what it used to be.

I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.

Fred, I don't know what to say. A thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature.

An attempt to ruin us!

We got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this. What'll we tell 'em?

Just -- one -- second!

What?

I was just going to!

That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you?

Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out.

Five hundred dollars.

Well, all right. But I'm liable to get into a jam.

Oh-h-h... was she hurt?

-- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?

All right, Judge.

Phone for you, Hildy.

I'll take it.  What's the matter, Mr. Burns -- don't you understand English? -- Why, your language is shocking, Mr. Burns -- positively shocking! I don't mind because I was married to you and know what to expect, but suppose Central is listening in... Oh, did you hear that, Central? We ought to report him, don't you think?... Oh, fooey on you!

And up a dime.

I made it up just now, and who's asking you?  I know it's silly, honey, but do it for me, won't you?... Yes, right now.

Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?

First you got to sign a receipt. 

Thanks. So long, Hildy!

Well -- I was going, but Mollie fainted away and I thought I ought to do what I could.

That man there!

How would you go about applying the Golden Rule, Earl?

I won't, Earl. 

Yes -- that's right. Production for use.

What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.

Keep away!

Forty dollars.

Who do you think!

All right, Mr. Pinkus, all you've got to do is lay low and keep your mouth shut. Here!  Go to this address. It's a nice, homey little place, and they'll take care of you for the night. Just tell 'em Fred sent you. And here's fifty dollars on account.

No! It's easy -- it's very easy!

A very fine-looking women.

Hello, Mollie.

Say, Hildy...

-- tried to shoot it out with the cops but his gun wouldn't work, so --

I think you hit him, Grandpa. He was limping when he ran off.

Looking for shrapnel.

Who told you that?

It doesn't matter, I can drive the car home.

Would.

Not now. They wouldn't believe me.

...and six...

We will, you will, for the rest of our lives?

A bit too quick.

They might be.

Air-raid?

Please yourself.

...two Indians to fan me all night. The heat.

What's left of him. He'll never see outside of the Star and Garter.

Weeds will grow, Mac.

Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.

Bugger the Buffs.

We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only.

Jam.

Well, it's off ration. We know that.

It looks....foreign.

You taste it.

That's it.

Not till Christmas, I don't suppose.

Half the time he's bluffing.

Don't be silly, Dawn.

Out.

Now he's gone and made me fall in love with him, which I never wanted to do. I told him that.

Why? It's coming on its own. It doesn't hurt.

No, Mother! It's War! War!

You might still have a house.

I don't mind it. It was harder before the war. Trying to keep up appearances. Now it's patriotic to be poor.

Really, that's a long time.

Yeah, it won't take long and besides you sassy poodle girls will slow us down.

Baby! Stop!

No, I told you...

Who's your Daddy!

A dead one.

Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?

Fucking great.

Yeah, I'll do something.

How long is a piece of string? Too God damn long, that's how long.

Shit, I don't remember exactly. I took over for my Pa just after the Duke nabbed the Oscar.

I don't drive cross country.

Yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that I remember from fourth grade... called a... shit, what did we call her?  Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling.

Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.

So, the guy goes to Hell and the devil says, "do you smoke?" The guy say, "yeah"... the devil say, "great cause Tuesday is cigar night, sweetest Cuban cigars you ever had."

Don't panic yourself, way too much caffeine guy... I see a sign.  Captain Spaulding's Museum of Madmen and Monsters... cool. Also... fried chicken and... gasoline... next exit.

Way out here?

Jesus, you think she was really gonna cut you?

Here he comes.

Turn that fucking radio off!

Yeah, showtime for what?

What!

Hmmmmmmmmm?

Had to take him to the hospital. Kid had Dr. Zaius stuck half way up his butt, couldn't get it out.

No dear, I'm fine. Now what kind of host would I be if I put my guests to this kind of work.

Tickets for what?

I don't want to see that.

That seems likely.

Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.

Blah, blah, blah... it doesn't say, but she was released sometime in 1937, only to reappear as Ellie Bogdan, the arm-less wonder. Says she, "criss-crossed the United States constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946."

I don't know, I just thought it was interesting.

Yeah, she said we looked queer.

I don't know... about half an hour.

I think I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack.

Bill, why don't you ask her... she's your special friend.

Yeah, no mercy here.

Yep, I suppose it is.

His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J.

Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody.

You said it, not me.

Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.

What!

Well, Bill... he's a good guy, he's been great help to me... a real blessing... I couldn't have asked for a better specimen. I mean you don't know what a dry spell I've had, total block...  ...total block... but Bill he's OK.

Let's go see.

Oh, alright... I guess I can trust you... being a man of the law and all.

No, I can't say that I ever seen 'em before...  ...he looks familiar, is he on TV?

Over here, inside the smokehouse.

Oh, yeah, you know about that? Hmmm, that's a strange one.

I always favored the Hulk.

Aw, fuck.

That is the wrong fork, young man.

And think about what you've done.

Son, your mother and I are doing a production of The Gin Game at the local community theater. We forgot to take off our make-up.

It's going famously, son, famously!

It's embarrassing, okay?

Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.

Great.  God, I've wanted you forever.

Hi. I just wanted to tell you that I very much enjoy working with you.  Now I'm embarrassed that I say this.

Merci. I... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?

Not at all.

Of course not.

I shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, I know.

Shh.

Shit.  Hi, honey.

Hmmph. Hmmph.  Nathan, we have to talk, you and I.

But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.

Hi. It's Nathan.

Well, I think it would be easier if I could talk to you in person.

Of course not, that Swedish thief! He's a thief of hearts!  I love you, Gabrielle.

Oui.

Please let me go with you.

It's okay, Puff.

It's an animal urge, Puff. It's nothing to be ashamed of.

Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us.

Ouch. Yeah?

Always. Ow.

Shut up and tell me.

Loves animals? Ouch. Must love animals, Rose.

Holy shit. Your brother didn't tell him about the nature of our relationship, did he?

God, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff.

Lila, I want to help you.

Ready!

You are a therapist, right?

What's the larger experiment?

I'm not sure.

It's only that I really enjoy your company and...

Yes, and...

Yeah  But I have some peculiarities also.

Nathan!

Terrific. Can't wait!

Yes, darling.

Fifteen.

I think he's feral.

What?

Nathan, what the hell are you talking about?

Nothing. Be right out.

Your entire body?

I love being female because it, how do you say, allows me to be close to men.

Yeah. It's nice. It's really good.

Sure. Of course.

Oh, Nathan, let's have a baby!

Nothing. Hard day. Gonna have a drink.

How come?

Such as what womanly things?

Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.

Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.

Ugnh.

Lila?

Oh, I will!  Your very trust has instilled an enormous sense of responsibility in me. I don't want to disappoint you.

Thanks to you, Buddy. And your diligence and intelligence and perseverance.

I have to talk. Is that okay?

Well, it seems that since Lila broached the subject of children, you've been on edge and I know you have an issue with the, uh, body hair.

And how do you feel about Gabrielle?

I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.

Yep.

Mm hmm.

Hey, he's right!  Whaddya say, Charlie, huh? Play a little pool? Wait out the heat?

Check!

Oh, I forgot all about it.  How's the hands?

She's a smart girl, Eddie.

We're neighbors now. You can call me Sarah.

Do we need words?

No, there's no tomorrow. Not with you. You own all the tomorrows because you buy them today, and you buy cheap.

Cash.

Two.

Yeah. Sure, sure.

Why?

Why back me then? Why not back yourself? Go find yourself a big fat poker game and get rich. You know all the angles.

Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.

You know everybody, don't you?

Maybe you oughta give me lessons.

Like I told ya. My thumbs.

Maybe I'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. And a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.

I played that game, Bert. In my head I played it a thousand times.

C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.

You hustlin' me?

I don't know.

And just how do you figure that, Bert? What do you figure I owe you?

What if I don't pay ya, Bert?

I'm a businessman, kid.

No, it don't have to be fifty. It can be thirty... twenty-five.

Come up here to play straight pool with Minnesota Fats?

Get with what?

Give me a drink, will ya?

If that's all you got, that's all we got left.

I'll connect. I'll get you your money back.

Never been out of it. I'm gonna beat that fat man... with that curly hair, and those diamond rings, and that carnation.

I told you you'd get your money back.

Now and then. Why, do you?

I'm having some people over for drinks right after the races. Why don't you all come over? Then about nine, ten o'clock we can play.

No, none for me. Come on, let's play.

I don't play pool, Mr. Felson. I play billiards. My house, my game. You don't have to play if you don't want to.

Okay, friend.

Shoot.

Call it.

I don't rattle, kid. But just for that I'm gonna beat you flat.

Yeah, I'm quittin'.

Eight o'clock.

Why not? We already know each other's secrets.

How come you didn't catch your bus?

Cramped.  You always drink like this, so early in the morning?

No, not always.

I'm not.

I drink.

No.

Come here.

What did you say that for, Sarah?

Okay. So what's your name today?

Thanks.

I'm getting treatments right here.

When you've got money, you'll pay.

No, stick around.  Can I get you something? Drink? Coffee?

Me. It's Eddie.

What's it so hot in here for?

Would he know?

I love you.

Two.  Sherry?... Nice joint. You look very pretty.

Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while.

Oh, I don't know.

More like a week. Look, I'll be back.

Come here. Come on, now.

California. Oakland.

Twelve. Cross side.

Mm hm... Two ball, side pocket.

Yes.

You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?!

We don't know that --

I want to talk.  I just learned again.

They are... sinister.  They want to kill me.

I'm am architect.  I'm working on a site back in --

I'll have to go to a new school -- again.

It's got a name.  Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here.

That's Mars.  The closest planet to us, now.  That's why it's more than just a point in the sky.

Was there anything over the hill?

What, Jim, what?

Good night.

I don't have many friends.  Dad's all the time moving.

Yes.

Behind my house, up on the ridge.

Maybe -- it landed in the bushes.

Hide the car.

I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town.

Mom -- this is the best show all year.

No, Mom.  It wasn't a plane.

What? -- I... 

The back door was open.

What?

This afternoon.  It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part.

They're from out of state.  Father's an engineer at the nuclear power plant. I really don't know much about them.

If we do, we'll both die virgins. But at last we'll be together.

I've worked with embedded loading. They're communicating with a hidden signal. They're going to attack...

I wanted a career. Didn't you ever want to be part of something special?

If anything goes wrong I'll have to think quickly, adjust the signal, who knows?

What's the bad news?

And the good news is you won't charge me.

Haven't you been watching?

What happened?

Remember I told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to extinction.

You want to borrow the car? You don't have a license.

They don't know this.

She didn't take my name when we were married.

You can do that?

He wasn't the President then.

Great.

I can't shake her free.

You as well.

Then God help us.

ETA with target; four minutes.

We're down to approximately fifteen percent, Sir.  If you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours.

Roger, Eagle One, our primary target has shifted course.

He's doing a good job.

Sorry for what?

Yeah, but what an entrance!

I thought you said you were doing to break it off.

We're already over Mach 2!

Jimmy, stay with me.

We should leave too.

But, Mr. President...

Above American soil?

Two words, Mr. President. Plausible deniability.

The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...

Air... water... your "sun."

And I am his.

There is no museum in Iskenderun.

Well done, Indy. Very well done, indeed. This will find a place of honor in our Spanish collection.

Yes. My treat.

I don't know. But whatever it is, he's in over his head!

Where?

Dad was onto something here!

Alexandretta. Now we know.

Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun.

It's a rescue, old boy. Come on.

No, Henry. Try not to talk.

I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.

Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.

How dare he?!

The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea.

We're through!

Find something?

Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.

He never would have made it past the rats! He hates rats! He's scared to death of them!

How do you know?

So it did.

Where is it? I want it.

All I have to do is scream.

It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.

Then wait -- count to twenty.

Don't worry -- I'm fine.

Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.

Good point.

He was actually there? You saw him?

Will you take it easy!

I came here to save you.

Umh?

She talks in her sleep.

All right, move! Move! Rock your Chair. Do what I do.

What?

But what are they? Can't you remember?

What about Marcus?

I was the next man.

And do I detect a rebuke?

Thanks.

I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean?

No.

If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.

The secret of the Grail has been safe for a thousand years. And for all that time the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword has been prepared to do anything to keep it safe.

Just a routine inspection tour.

Finally!

Dinner? And with a prince?! My luck is changing. But look at me -- my god, I've to get ready!

A very fine collection of very old pieces, don't you think?

Dr. Jones, in our country a guest does not usually insult his host.

Sure, I found him. Then last night I had a little trouble. Somebody tried to slit my throat.

Next time I'll cut off more than his finger.

Step on it, Short Round!

Sure, Indy -- three tickets! You, me and Wu Han --

It's just superstition, Shorty. Like a ghost story.

Read you loud and clear, Indy!

Nobody can say you don't have a vivid imagination.

You are in no position to give orders, Dr. Jones.

They say we must pray to their evil god. We say we will not.

Who cares? Where's that diamond!

Since I was nice enough to let you tag along, why don't you give your mouth a rest? Okay, doll?

No... I'm not cut out for the kind of life you lead.  Oh no... I ripped my dress. Where are we anyway?

That's more food than these people eat in a week.  They're starving, too...

Their children?

First of all -- don't panic!

It's curling around me! Damn it, stop talking and do something!

THE WHAT?!

Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to latch onto a good-looking, incredibly rich prince.

Oh really?

Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones?

You're dreaming, Willie. You want to make it real, just knock on my door.

I can't find any lever! Help me Indy!

That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!

It's a Thuggee ceremony. They're worshipping Kali, the goddess of Death and Destruction.

I'm not leaving without those stones.

Go!

You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about.

They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving.

Who's you?

What street?

Where are we now?

Well...If you're in my head... to you, I'm...GOD!

I'm trying to get you to listen to reason.

I don't know what you're talking about.

No.

Still clear. Just a motorcycle.

They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need."

I'll sue.

That's it. They know I'm in here. We've got to find them.

They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.

You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.

You can't go home. When UST finds we're gone, they'll come after you and put us away.

Nothing!

Composition of the sand, ...trace elements..unique...

You are not alone. But you are incon- picuous...and, with our abilities...

The beach.

Eat it.

Why not?

What was?

Where are you staying?

This...is not going to work out.

It is my business. It's my name.

You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.

That place. By the window.

What glasses.

Your data must be bad. Everyone can't be lying all the time.

Not her. You!

You can't listen. You can't watch either.

Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.

It is a blank. This is no time for Zen.

Don't worry!

Trying to analyze this stuff. Now...go to the medicine shelf and take ---- and ----.

Then why let her out of our sight? Besides, she's all we've got...

The man we want has the PEM, and is across the border by now.

GRUNER switched the chip to him, not from him, then he led us away again...to Chiang Cho.

Keep thinking.

Now, you're too suspicious.

You've changed your mind.

I mean it!  No one else would have helped. I take it all back, everything I've said about you.

That's nice.

JOE It's not love. It's like. It's real strong like. And I got your information. Now, get off my back!

RYUJI Bandaio. Grown near here.

Don't worry.

Look, I don't know how we're gonna get out of this.

Let us get to the border!

Rene?

No. If anything happened, you'd be stuck in there like he was.

**?!! 

He's...more. Somehow, enhanced... He's...zxflbbgt!

What?

Thanks.

Oh.

Been complaning of hallucinations.

Much better now, thank you. Just sit here quietly...see there's nothing to worry about...just be my old self again....soon...

Just give me the keys.

Nothing.

I said...I didn't say..anything!

No. No one to speak of.

I just work for the travel firm.

Me still. They left you alone?

You talk to yourself.

You're talking to me.

Hires you for what?

They kidded me a little.

There's not much to tell.

This is a tough place to keep Kosher.

What'd he steal?

One chip?

Get your things.

Oh sure.

Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.

They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about something.

Beats me.

He plays it all the time.

We figure out if it's in here.

I said just relax. I'm in full control.

You've  been there?

You coming along?

This going to work?

They can hold us here forever. Nobody knows about us.

Why not, what are you going to do?

You're gonna laugh.

Do something!

It was you.

Why are you on to him?

I'm sorry. We're running behind. So many applicants...so few jobs... If you'll just have a seat.

It is?

Just one. The back up.

I can't get it out. It would take hours.

It doesn't hurt.

For reading.

Okay.

That remote control thing?

Yes, baby?

You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.

I'll take a look at what you got. But I'm not moving any deadlines 'cause you say so.

Yeah. Catch you later.

Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.

Oh, we need cops on the street. We don't need them on horses.

Yeah, they argued he was going to reveal the secret formula of "Kools" to the world.  "Sealed" doesn't hurt Scruggs' litigation, and since we're the only ones with the story, I believe we're sitting on an exclusive.

It's not a rumor. It's a sale.  If Tisch can unload CBS for $81 a share to Westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from Brown & Williamson, that could screw up the sale, could it not?

Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money. They work for free. And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer.

No, I'm questioning your hearing! You hear "reasonable" and "tortious interference." I hear... "Potential Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to Westinghouse." I hear... "Shut the segment down. Cut Wigand loose. Obey orders. And fuck off...!" That's what I hear.

What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.

No. I should have. I told them I disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original. I'm not lying for you. I'm not gonna shut up for you. Not on any of it.

Oh, c'mon, Lowell. This is The New York Times. I don't know...

Okay... About this whistle-blower... Did Mike and Don go along with the corporate decision?

Soy sauce...

That's my stuff from the office...

Thomas Sandefur...

No, thank you.

I told him that you had an E-mail death threat that said if you didn't shut the "F" up, they were going to kill you...

Can we talk about this when I get back?

"60 Minutes"?

It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...

No. No, it's okay... How's -- how's the new place?

I'll call you then.

What chance is there of getting Jeff's interview on the air...?

...and I'd be lying to you if I didn't tell you, I'm about out of moves, Dick...

You eating with us?

How are the rooms? Comfortable?

Good.

What?

No, I usually sit around in my hotel room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning, sleepy look on my face.

Oh, please, Mike...

I did? What do I tell a source on the next tough story? Hang in with us. You'll be fine... maybe?

Because I think Hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now. So you care about what you're thought of in America. And in America, at this moment in time, Hezbollah does not have a face.  That's why.

That's good. That works.  Uh, you know, I want to ask you something... I know it sounds odd... but...

That's room service. They usually knock first.  Come on in... Over here, please.

Is there anything you want to know about me, Mr. Wigand...?

Did work.

If you want to do it.

Good. I want to talk to you.

How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?

No. I did not. Big Tobacco is a big story. And you got something important to say. I can tell.  But, yes. I did. I came all the way down here to tell you: story, no story, fuck your story, I don't burn people.

They're afraid of you, aren't they?

Like what?

Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All health-related.  What else? Outside the "zone"...?

I can't talk about it. The work I was supposed to do... might have had some positive effect. I don't know... it could have been beneficial.  Mostly, I got paid a lot. I took the money. My wife was happy. My kids had good medical. Good schools. Got a great house.  I mean, what the hell is wrong with that...?

Makes you feel good? Putting what you know to use?

My father? What the hell's that got to do with my father?

They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand?

I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions.

You believe that because you get information out to people... something happens?

I don't think you really understand --

They're terrorizing us. Death threats?! To my family? My kids?!

They do this with impunity!

They get to go home at night. What does it cost these people to do this to us? Nothing?! My girls are crying, so fuck them! I want to tape! I'm done thinking about it.

...to talk about it. To think about it. I had a plan to ease her into it. But, I really -- I didn't know how to do that...

What?

What kind of shit is this? I was not on the team, I sparred with the Olympic Team... okay?

A can opener! A $39.95 can opener. I canceled payment... It was junk.  You ever bounce a check, Lowell? You ever look at another woman's tits? You ever cheat a little on your taxes?  Whose life, if you look at it under a microscope, doesn't have any flaws...?

I told the truth... I told the truth.

And I've got to refute every fucking accusation made in this report before The Wall Street Journal runs.  I am trying to protect you, man!

That's bullshit, Jeff!

No, no. Don't call the police!  Just tell him I'm on the phone with you... My name is Lowell Bergman... Just tell him that.

He doesn't seem to be listening...

I can't say that!

She's okay.

Liane has filed for divorce...

Where you staying now?

Dr. Wigand, you do understand what could happen, don't you?

...I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself because I watched those testimonies very carefully.

Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly misstated, at least within Brown & Williamson's representation, clearly misstated... what is common language within the company... we are in the nicotine delivery business.

A delivery device for nicotine.

You're gonna get your fix...

It acts as a drug on the body?

Oh, you got rights and lefts! Ups and downs and middles! So what?! You don't get to instruct anything around here! This is not North Carolina, not South Carolina nor Kentucky. This is the sovereign State of Mississippi's proceeding. Wipe that smirk off your face! Dr. Wigand's deposition will be part of this record. And I'm going to take my witness' testimony! Whether the hell you like it or not!  Answer the question, Dr...

When should we do this?

That's why we hire scientists...

I told you we know each other, baby. Mr. Massey represented my ex-brother- in law. Martin Reiser?

Howard!

Few suicide attempts, little inpatient stint. Naturally, she misses her kids. Six weekends a year and alternate Yom Kippurs seemed harsh to us but -- hey -- all's fair. Anyhoo, she lives with a "nurse," takes her meds and goes to occupational therapy at a local sheltered workshop.

She makes felt wallets. Got one right here.

Why not? I'm going to have her for a lifetime.

Who do you want me to kill?

Is that... one person?

No...

Sustained.

Oh. That.  Don't waste time with your queen.

Thanks, buddy.

I can't have a baby with a man I don't love... And I can't submit a child to divorce.

Why do you think she did it?

It's about time.

I think Ming is older than Tong.  What is this?

See the tape. Then we can discuss my heart.

What does your lawyer think?

You didn't ask me here to pick me up. You could get in trouble for that.

But why him?

Miles?

No. Don't stop.

And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.

I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.

Yes. Again.

No. Stay. I want you close to me. This couch is wrong. It's not a "married couch."

Fabric and fringe.

I'm sorry, Darling. I love it. It's chic and timeless and elegant and eclectic and. It's you, Marylin. It is YOU.

On the contrary. We're married and we have no pre-nup, so a case could be made that everything in here is mine.

That's blackmail.

Now. But first, he worked for you.

Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt when I realized you'd hired the goon to kill...

Murder?

I thought so.

Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?

You used his credit card.

She did a Harriman.

Now? She's a night manager at McDonalds.

I wish I had your discipline.

No. I'll see some blood before this is over, but it won't be mine.

Hello Miles.

It's not Ming. It's Tong.

He would invite these girls home from the staple factory to our condominium in Palm Springs. He had a device he called the Intruder.

He tricked you. With a phony wife and a fake pre-nup. Howard Doyle. He got you. You married Marylin, didn't you? You thought she had money. HA HA HA. Howard Doyle made you think that because of what you did to me. And to Marylin Rexroth. Yeah. I heard all about it. My brother Howard Doyle got you.  Neener neener neener.

At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.

My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.

Oh brother. Here we go.

Yes. Maybe you're right, Miles. Maybe we're being too conservative. Seventy five percent.

She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask her? Anyway, I assume she signed the highly over rated Massey pre-nup.

We've outlined a settlement...

Rex, please.

No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.

You know what I mean when I say "it."

I'm not sure.

Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?

I'd stay away from her, Miles.

Miles.

The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style.

Mother?

Hard to believe I know. I'm sure you are frequently mistaken for sisters.

You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?

Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so.

She's keeping his name. And one of his planes. And all seven of his children

I'm worried, Lovington. After all, something might have happened to her. 

Yes, sir?

That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted.  Why does she think I lugged her all the way from Miami  for the love of it?

And this is what you wantthirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?

Yes, I knowbut

You're a peculiar chap.

All right! Put me in chains! Do anything you want!  But I'm not going to eat a thing until you let me off this boat!

I won't stand for it! I won't stand for your running my life! Why do you insist on it!

Yes. I know.  Because I'm your daughter and you love me. Because you don't want me to make any mistakes. Because

Please. I can't fight on an empty stomach. Remember what Napoleon said.

I'll get it annulled.

Never mindI'll get it myself.  Gigolo? Why, you took the word right out of my mouth. Thanks.

Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming. 

He doesn't think so much of you either.

No, I'll go through with it.

What happened to your money?

Just between you and me, I never intended taking it off.

Ohthe papers

Hey, whadda you tryin' to dokid me?

What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up.

You win!

Yeah?

Holy Smokes! You'll never get out yourself! Better phone for some help.

Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to you  scram.

Are you talking to me?

Don't be a fool. You lost your bag. The company'll make good. What's your name?

Why, that's ridiculous! They're responsible for everything that

You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.  Here's your ticket.

I found it on the seat.

You must have me confused with

If you play your cards right, you might get some money out of it. 

Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York.

What'd you do? Wire one of your friends for money?

Yeah. Yeah, not bad. How's your's?

Egg. One eggdoughnutsblack coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?

Yeah?

Oh. Is that how you met him?

What are you talking about?

There you go again! How many times did I tell you to stop butting in when I have an argument?

Well, you were!

Yeah, and gotten yourself arrested!

At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him.

I don't trust that chatterbox.

You didn't give that boy all your money?

No.

remember distinctly Father taking me for a "piggy-back" ride

That's silly.

Well, take them off.

All right! Don't take them off. Do whatever you please. But shut up about it.

By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.

Yeah. I was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy.

Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating?

When you get up to a hundred, wake me up.

You're such a smart aleck! Nobody can do anything but you. I'll show you how to stop a carand I won't use my thumb.

Come onget in.

Okay.  Cottage Number Three.

I don't care. I love you. Nothing else matters. We can run away. Everything'll take care of itself.  Please, Peter. You can't go out of my life now. I couldn't live without you.  Oh, Peter

I would. But I've got a weak stomach.

I heard about your stunt. That's swell, King. Just think of itthe groom lands on the lawn with a plane. It's a perfect beginning for the life we're going to lead. It sets just the right tempo.  Come on, King. You're lagging. 

Why, he'll be back.

Serves you right. Oughta be careful who you take up with on the road. You can't go plyin' your trade in my camp.

Yeah.

That's okay by me! 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, I'm through with newspapers! See? I'm through with stupidity! I'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if I have to starve.  Yeah? What about my novel! When I get through with that

Wait a minute, GordonI

Don't "Joe" me.

Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollarsand I need it quick. I'm in a jam.

Well, I got it, Joe.

It's all right here. Give me the thousand and it's yours.

Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail!

I am, Joe.

For heaven's sake, Joestop being an editor for just a minute.  We've been friends for a long time, haven't we? You ought to know when I'm serious. This is on the level.

Well, I'll be

ain't got a hat

Hey, you!

I'd like to sit with myuhwifeif you don't mind. 

That's right.

What?

What's on your mind?

You're a pretty shrewd baby.  We better get away from this gang. Talk this thing over privately.

Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, seeand

But I'm a married man. I got a couple of kids. I can't get mixed up with

Orange, New Jersey.

Oh, gee, Misteryou wouldn'tyou ain't thinkin' about

SuresureI'll keep my trap shut. you can depend on me, Mister.

Come on, scram! And stay away from that bus.

The interesting thing is the extent to which the Warren Commission went to make him a Communist.  They got almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of the report on this Mexico trip and the picture doesn't even match.  I'm beginning to think the point of the Mexican episode was to lay the blame at Castro's door.  If Oswald, or someone purporting to be Oswald, had gotten into Cuba, come back, then killed the President, the American public once again would've screamed for a Cuban invasion...

"Threat to assassinate President Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, November 22-23.  Information received by the Bureau has determined that a militant revolutionary group may attempt to assassinate President Kennedy on his proposed trip to Dallas, Texas, etc, etc..."

I've seen him copying files, leaving here late at night.

Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...

You can't ever say crime don't pay in Louisiana, Jim - only not as good as it used to.  Good chowder, ain't it?

Swishes.  They swish, y'know.  Young fags, you know.  They'd come into my bureau needing help, no bread, and I'd say, hey man, I ain't Rockefeller, who gonna back you up?  These cornmuffins go to the phone and dial...

You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  He had command of the king's English.

Mario, Jose - they wear names like you and I wear clothes.  Today the name is Candy, tomorrow it's Butsie. I wish I could help you, Jim.

God's sake, chief.  The President was shot.

Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.

Yes, but we're talking about a dead warehouse employee of no political significance.  Three years later and he's still classified?  They gave us his grammar school records, a study of his pubic hairs... Put it in context, Bill, of what we know about Oswald.  Lonely kid, no father, unstable childhood, high school dropout - wants to grow up and be a spy, joins the Marines at 17.  He learns Russian, he acts overtly Marxist with two other marines, but he's stationed at a top secret base in Japan where U2 spy flights over Russia originate.  He's discharged from the Marines supposedly because his mother's sick.  He stays home 3 days, then with a $1500 ticket from a $203 bank account, he goes to Moscow...

Boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew... 

I'm just an investigator, Bill.  I leave the theories to you lawyers.

Who is he, Joe?  I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.

Go on, Willie.

At 7:30 Sunday morning?  It's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss.

The murder of a President, Bill, is a crime in Orleans Parish too.  I didn't pick you because of your legal skill, you know.

We're saying that when Oswald went to Russia, he was not a real defector, that he was an intelligence agent on some kind of mission for our government and he remained one till the day he died, that's what we're saying.

Oh, now you're saying Lyndon Johnson was involved?  The President of the United States?

Boss, are you calling the President a murderer?

Not in a routine autopsy, but if we looked at the spinal fluid, there might be a high level of iodine, but it's difficult to know.  Whatcha thinkin', Jim?

If it's a suicide, I seen weirder, Jim. 

No, I did not.

No, I did not.

Dave, you know that's where this road leads.

I see.  And where did you drive?

Did you bag any geese on this trip?

Everybody!  The Agency.  The Mob. The Cubans.  Yeah, follow the Cubans. Check them out.  Here, in Dallas, Miami.  Check out a guy named Eladio del Valle.  My paymaster when I flew missions into Cuba - he's somewhere in Miami.  You're on the right track.

Black, black - just give it to me.  Shit.  I'm so exhausted.  My neck is killing me.  I've got cancer.  Had it for years.  I been working with mice, y'know, trying to come up with a cure.

What?

If that's your case, you didn't have a case.  I wouldn't believe whatever Habighorst said, anyway.

No, Jasper, nobody's gonna kill us.

There's nothing wrong with feeling a little scared, Jasper, Virginia. Telling the truth can be a scary thing.  It scared President Kennedy, but he was a brave man.  If you let yourself be too scared, then you let the bad guys take over the country, don't you - and then everybody gets scared.

No.  I had guns all my life.  I used to go turtle shooting.

I was scared.  It was all kinda queer, but it sure felt like two and two was coming up three... and then they took Mary's five snapshots from me, sent them to Washington, and when they returned them weeks later, two of them had the backgrounds mutilated... The only one we saved was in Mary's camera.  I didn't want to go to Washington when the Warren Commission subpoenaed me... so the lawyer come down here and interviewed me at Parkland Hospital.

None!  The State Department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel.  He's never investigated or charged by the Navy for revealing classified information or, as far as we know, debriefed by the CIA.

Dammit, it doesn't add up!  Ordinary people get blacklisted for leftist affiliations!  The State Department did everything short of dispatching a destroyer to Minks to insure Oswald's return.  Only intelligence people can come and go like that.

Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet.

I wonder about the Williams'.  Just where did the first description of Oswald come from at 12:44?  No one knows.  They claimed it was Brennan's, but his description came after 1 P.M.  Who called?  Somehow the FBI's been tapping the Williams' and picks up a call between Bell Helicopter and Janet's phone, an unidentified voice saying "We both know who's responsible."  Who called?  Why's the Bureau been tapping them?

Bugging the District Attorney's office of New Orleans!  It's outrageous!

Well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times.

Pffft!  Absolute nonsense.  The Quarter is filled with vivid imaginations, my dear Mr. Garrison - grimy young hoodlums who'll say and do anything.  As you well know.

David Ferrie.

...and that the four of you partied early into the morning hours...

Clay Bertrand?  Clay Bertrand?  I believe there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the Chamber of Commerce.  Is that the man you had in mind?

Of course not!  Such a pity, that assassination.  In fact, I admired President Kennedy.  A man with true panache, and a wife with impeccable taste.

Mr. Garrison, you're reaching.  I am an international businessman.  The Trade Mart which I founded is America's commercial pipeline to Latin America.  I trade everywhere. I am accused, as are all businessmen, of all things.  I somehow go about my business, make money, help society the best I can and try to promote free trade in this world.

Oh, she did, huh?  When I come up I'll show you how Saturday night got invented.

Liz, do I have to spell it out for you?  Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.  That was no accident he was in Russia.  He was probably in military intelligence.  That's why he was trained in Russian.

But why in the Lord's name would you do it in the middle of Easter Sunday when you knew we were...

You're missing most of your life, Jim, and you don't even know it. The kids are missing out too.  It's not just you making the sacrifice here, honey.

Oh, I don't know anymore!  I believe there was a conspiracy, but not the government.  I just want to raise our children and live a normal life! I want my life back!

Fuck, yeah!  I told you so.  And you can tell'em all I told you so.

Bring on all the motherfuckers! Bring their college degrees in here! I got nuthin' to hide.  They can't buy me.  You can't buy me.  I don't even need the parole.  This is about the truth coming out.  You're a goddamn liberal, Mr. Garrison, you don't know shit, cause you never been fucked in the ass.  Fascism is here now, Facism is...

He's been in trouble before.  Used to be a hot shot pilot for Eastern Airlines, but he got canned after an alleged homosexual incident with a 14-year old boy.

Lou, you were in the Marines.  Who would be running that training?

What are you driving at, boss?

I can't say that comes as a surprise anymore.

We need to find more witnesses, Lou.

Why not just shoot Kennedy coming up Houston?  There's plenty of time - he's out in the open - a frontal shot?

We need him back.

Maybe you didn't hear what I said. I will not tolerate this infighting among the staff, I warn you that...

Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.

I've been called everything under the sun, Jerry.  Call me whatever you like.

You didn't get that break you needed, but you went as far as any man could, bubba.  What can I do for you?

Just think... just think.  What happened to our country .. to the world...  because of that murder... Vietnam, racial conflict, breakdown of law, drugs, thought control, guilt, assassinations, secret government fear of the frontier...

More than ten years.

If you buy what you read in the paper.

The assassination, Jack?

It's a contradiction, Numa, get used to them.  The only explanation for the royal treatment is he did give them radar secrets.  Or fake secrets.

Yes, your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there.

Splendid, love to see them.

Less than you would guess.  Most days two to three assistant D.A.'s. A handful of police investigators.

The job manages to keep me pretty busy.

That sounds fun.

Yes.

Mr. Ruby, I really can't see why you can't tell us now.

Well I don't know what can be done, Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what you anticipate we will encounter.

Sure, 'cause I didn't ask her if I could go.

Who was there for your ass?

Three years.

A bit.

Well, it ain't so much a problem a a situation. Remember I sold those three M-60 machine guns outta the five I got?

We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll be in there -- ten minutes.

I can't believe you do me this way.

I found out.

That looks like fifty thousand dollars from here.

She almost sounds scared.

Sure.

'Course I do -- I deliver money for him.

She leaves, somebody'll be on her.

Who do you think I am?

Why does it need to be dark?

What's your brand?

Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand here. What would you say?" But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to Customs, and I could tell they didn't want to do that.

Who gave me the money and who I was giving it to. And some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off. Said it was him who told them 'bout me.

Ordell pick up his bond?

Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.

I have a pretty good idea. Ordell ain't no bootlegger and I doubt he's smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would be interested in.

I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.

Yeah.

The Delfonics.

What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.

He called you?

No thanks. There's gotta be other ways to get it out.

If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.

Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling out ten years ago. So I did something about it.

Bigger?

Surprise.

I know, ignoring me. What're you up to?

Sandra Bullock. You know her?

Right around here, in the food court.

Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.

Not really. But I knew this narcotics cop one time. Told me that in a raid, the whole package never gets back to the station. His exact words.

He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.

When did you decide?

That's my job.

That's what you do to go through with the shit you start. You rationalize. I can do this, Max, I know I can. But I can't do it without you.

In the bag underneath.

He won't -- I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top.

On the phone I told him I have the ten thousand he put up for your bond. I could bring the money and the papers for him to sign. Walk out and call the Sheriff's department.

Why?

Less ten percent.

What's he doing?

I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do.

With the prior? You could get anywhere from a year to five depending on the judge. You want to think about it? You got two minutes before we're up.

You know what's in the bag you're taking?

Well, Sheronda, it was nice talking to you.

You planted that shit on me.

It isn't enough for Trafficking, but how 'bout Posession with the Intent to Distribute?

You two meet?

What's her story?

And splittin' with her?

I was told ten thousand in each pack.

What? To put one of these in my pocket?

I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.

This guy with Melanie, that was Louis Gara?

What about me?

Buy ya a beer?

Dreaming.

Thanks.

I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.

They told me.

I think it's a gun pressing against my dick.

Go sit over in that chair.

I been thinkin about that, too, and I got me a idea.

The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?

Oh, wait, you mean that place that has the big sign with a rooster on it?

That's a good idea.

And they follow the wrong one thinkin' she's bringing it to me.

I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?

I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?

I need to talk to you alone.

Well, you weren't supposed to be there.

Ray, the A.T.F. guy.

Sure.

You lived in Japan, when?

Who's arm is that?

Now that's over, let's get to know each other.

Yeah.

No.

Fuck you. I can carry it.

Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag?

What's your cost?

Which one is for the car?

Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.

Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back and forth. They had some black girl from some black show on Jay Leno. I watched that for a bit, but I kept flippin channels cause I didn't know who she was.

I'm in my underwear.

So we on the same page then?

But you did have a Salvation Army- thing going.

Did you get it?

Melanie must be dyin' to see it.  Louis.

Uh-huh.

In the chest and stomach.

You said five hundred and fifty!

Look, I swear to fucking god, she came out with that bag and I took it from her.

That's right.

It's in there.

That's why I never checked it. The bag felt right.

What?

Tell me.

Why should I think anything's weird, if I don't know nothin' about them knowing each other?

Hold on a minute.  Where you going?

Watcha gonna see?

Where would you like me to put my ash?

Fella named Beaumont. They have him up at county. It started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up "possession of a concealed weapon." Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.

They ran his name and got a hit. He's been in before.

Will they consider this a violation of his probation?

She had, I believe it was... fifty grand on her, too. There was a cop at the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D. wanted her bond set at twenty- five thousand, saying there was a risk of flight. Jackie being a stewardess and all.

Did the police contact you?

You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement --

Mister Robbie, isn't it? I have the ten thousand you put up. Isn't that why you called.

She got off, huh?

I thought you might be asleep.

And you did that to protect my interest?

You get used to it after a while. Now tell me where my money's at.

She wanted to see me, why wasn't she home?

Call her, tell her the combination.

You expect me to just walk in there?

By herself. That big mandingo nigga Winston ain't there, is he?

I know where it is.

You know it's for you.

'Ola!

We been shoppin'. Can't have my boy running around lookin' like a bum on the street.

No problem.

He leave town?

Where do you want to go?

Home?  This is your home. You're dead.

No, thanks.

I'm okay.

Yeah, ever since that ...

They're not interested, Jake.

Don't bother to call again, okay?

Gabe?  What are you doing ... ?

Then why aren't you teaching? Why aren't you in a university?

War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me.

But the paper ...

An explosion, just like Paul's.

We should get ourselves a lawyer.

Right. She doesn't stop talking about you. You're always on her mind. That's love, Jake.

If it was any other brain but yours, I might agree. Relax, this is going to be strong.

I've seen it. It's all pain.

There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis.

The postal service. I'm a mailman.

I don't know what to say.

Damn it. I was in the veteran's out- patient program. He knows me.

Jacob Singer.

Goddamn it! I don't want a social worker. Carlson knows me.

I don't want to know.

Who did?

Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.

Don't ask.

I don't know.

Look at her face. A real bitch.

I don't like things that make you cry.

Just gettin' rid of the garbage.

I'll be glad to avoid the crush.

Those guys tried to kill me tonight. They were aiming right at me.

I wanna leave. Get me out of here.

Where are we?

Where?

Get your clothes off!

You're red hot, damn it. Get in there. I've got to get more ice.

Here. I'll do it.

In a way. At least now I have some idea of what was happening. If we can only get them to admit ... to explain what they did ... I don't know. Maybe it'd clear things up in my head. I'll tell you something, Jez, honestly ... I thought they were real.

I don't believe this.

Let go!

Stay away from me, Jez.

You wanna know? Turn on the T.V. Watch the fucking news!

Hello ... No. He's not here. I haven't seen him all night ... I don't know when ... What? Tell him what?  Vietnam? ... What experiments?

A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him.

I promise.

No. I'm a marked man, Jez. I'm the only one left. I don't want to expose you to that. It's not right for you or me. Be reasonable.

Wake up. Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.

YOU KNOW WHO I AM.

What do you want me to say? My mother's tummy?

Don't be funny.

Stop it, Jez. Don't do that.

Don't play games with me. There's nothing more to say.

Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.

Long time ago.

A couple of days later. It was fierce. You guys never saw it.

One drop?

Pleasant dreams.

That's what I'd like to know. If you see him on the street somewhere, tell him he's fired.

Push 'em back.

For what? For seeking the truth?

What is wrong with you?

Total delirium.

Call my chiropractor.

A long time.

I need to see you, Jake.

I need to see you.

That black car?

You in trouble?

Oh God. I know. I know.

They keep telling me I'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire.  I carry these everywhere but they don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a report with the army.

She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us?

Died?

Bring it in.

Punk?

You got lucky.

We don't have a choice!

If we don't sever the hull completely she'll drag us down with her.

What?

Delongpre! Out of time!

Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around. So far so good.

Sergeant? We thought you were...

I'm coming, I'm coming.

Thorgan, suit up.

We could convert fission transistors.

I don't know!

Suit up.

Use the thrusters and you'll be fine. We'll huddle together out there.

I am an expert!

My job.

Not a chance.

You got that right.

What?

Negative.

We have to get off this ship.

Guys!!! The shuttle?

Yeah, that's it, scare the hell out of here, that'll work.

Med-kit?

That's a good fantasy, though. Kinky, but good.

So, you thought you'd be cool. Go against your father's wishes? Yeah, that's grown up.

Were you close to your father?

I think so, why?

I'm stuck!

We wait. I need about fifteen. Call me if there are any changes. If she farts I want a full report.

What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?

She needs a little time.

Again?! Jesus!

Well, do something!

Shut up, Thorgan!

Remember to roll his balls around a bit.

Shit! Temp's dropping! We should have left this rock an hour ago!

So what else is new?

Would you?

Maybe she tripped.

Teleportation? Some way to beam us the hell out of dodge?

Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.

Kay-em 14.

Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden.

Am I in there?

Who are you apologizing to?

We're missing two of the kids!

Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door.

No! He's coming with us!

He wants to kill you...and me...and everyone on this ship.

Keep trying!

Alright, I'm . . .  No way . . . is this a joke?

Get him out of there!

Old Earth?

It's okay.

I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it.

Here --  Take him home.

...'cause this is where he lives. You gotta think like they do.

Full throttle! To port!

I never hear the whistle.

Older, sillier.

Hey Chief. Bring my cup back.

Michael! Come inside!

I told him not to go out until he memorized the handbook and the safety safety regulations, until he was sure of himself...

Excuse me, but what are you talking about? Didn't they catch the shark this afternoon? It was on the Cape station news.

Thank you.

No. Home here.

No need to involve outsiders in our business, Martin.

I didn't agree to that!

That's good. That's real good. Ben Meadows getting pictures for the paper.

About half of them. A lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims.

Rogue?

What do we do?

Why don't we just tow it in?

I wish it would rain...

No...  You think we can get back with those?

Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out.

A thousand apiece, something like that. There's five of us. And we each kick in a hundred a week for beer and cleaning, stuff like that.

That wasn't funny.

Is anyone having this...?

I do.  But you've still got a problem here, there's a shark just off the island somewhere.

Is that a boat?

This is Quint, Missus.

We had a shark attack at South Chop this morning, Mayor. Fatal. Gotta batten down the beach.

Let me see your hands...

It ain't a Big Mac.  The expert don't approve. What do you thing? You're closer to the situation. 

Aye, Aye SIR. Stand by to repel boarders. Poop the mainsail. Argh, Jim Boy.

Let it go, don't waste your time.

No way! He can't!

Let's just cut him open and see what's inside...

Thanks for the message.

My mom uses color-safe bleach.

I'm supposed to be running.

So that's cool with you, then?

I did the prep questions for this lab last night. You can copy my answers if you need to.

I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.

Yeah. Um, I hooked up a whole private adoption thing. These married people in Saint Cloud are going to be the parents.

Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.

I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...

Oh. It's fine. What's another ten pounds?

Because they're your fave. And you can never have too much of your favorite one-calorie breath mint.

Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard.

Well, there we have it. Would you like to know the sex?

I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.

I think kids get bored and have intercourse. And I think Junebug was a dummy about it. But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out.

I would never barf in your urn, Brenda. Maybe L.B. did it.

But I'm going to give it up for adoption. I already found the perfect people.

Well, you're a brave young lady. You're made of stronger stuff than I thought. You're a little Viking!

First things first, we have to get you healthy. You need prenatal vitamins. Incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus. Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. Find out where you're going to deliver.

Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married.

Yeah, because you're allergic to their saliva. I've made a lot of sacrifices for you, Juno. And in a couple years you're going to move out -- and I'm getting Weimaraners.

Oh, go fly a kite.

Well, honey, doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream.

I'm a junior.

No Josh, I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man.

Fine. Call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brother's college just because you had four Smirnoff Ices and a bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored Boone's!

Cool. Well, let's sit down and get to know each other a bit.

Technically, that would be kickin' it Old Testament.

What? No! Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something?

What do you play?

Oh.

Sorry. I swear I'm not a gear snob.

You weren't even alive!

No, more commercial stuff.

Hey, I like this.

God, pretentious much? I guess everyone should have a mysterious name like Juno, huh?

Why? What the big deal?

I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.

Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my old comics down here, and I want to show you one of them.

Isn't that great? I got it when I was in Japan with my band. She reminds me of you.

What are you?

What's the matter?

Oh, hi Juno. How are you?

I heard that was you.

Yeah, but I hardly noticed it. I'm more worried about the part where I have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front.

What do you mean? You mean...  Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?

Happy? Oh, you mean like, physically. I'm good. Look, I have a snooze button now!

Your name, please?

No thank you. I'm off sex.

Paulie Bleeker? I didn't know he had it in him!

No, but you know Bren. She dreams big.

Dude, I'm pregnant.

Eh, I'll call them myself. But I do need your help with something very urgent.

That is sick, man.

There are ads? For parents?

No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking for something a little edgier.

It is really weird looking. It's like it's not even real. I can't believe there are saps who actually cry at these things.

Or stage parents!

Share the love, Tits!

What?

Of the Penny Saver Lorings?

Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date.

Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me. We're best friends.

Well, I was born to be a mother. Some of us are.

You don't make anything. It's for exercising.

Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married.

I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking.

Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.

Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --

It all just happened so fast. We put that ad in the paper. I thought it would take months if, you know, ever and then -- boom -- Two weeks later, she's in our living room.

Ever since, it's just been like a ticking clock.

No, it's fine. Thanks for making the call, I guess.

Looks like it, yeah.

Early Grayce if this ain't your lucky day.

I haven't... I'm a fast learner.

Sure.

Took 'em all.

What's Early been in jail for?

Almost.

What'll we do out there?

Bull. That ain't right... Government sends people there all the time, just don't want us to know about it.

Early, can we stop there... just for a little while.

She had a dream that somethin' like this was gonna happen.

Early! Stop!!

What do you need a Bible for?

No sir.

That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed.

How much do I owe you?

Hell yeah! I'll even spot ya a few points first game.

Nah... how much money have you got?

They picked up hitchhikers... young men... and brought them back here.

Thank god!

The party?

...just like that?

A book on the warehouse murders?

Maybe he wasn't allowed to leave! Geezus Brian!

I don't know.

No, thanks, I can manage.

...Brian hurt his foot.

Shut your mouth.

Everybody just shut up!

He wasn't going to shoot her, you murdering son of a bitch!

...You're hurting me...

Where would we find him?

Without his car?

Umm. Altogether?

Yes!

Oh my God. I can't tell you how nervous I've been. I couldn't sleep last night.

Did what take?

Yeah.

How did she smell? Did her puss stink?

Hell's yeah. She was so clean.

What?

How?

Right.

Did you tell her that you loved her?

I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost.

Yep.

Three pennies and a ball of lint.

Yeah, that would be fun but I don't like any of the girls you go out with. Like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring.

He looks like my uncle.

Yeah.

She hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for them.

Bet.

What are you talking about?

So.

Fifteen for me.

Yeah probably.

Hold up man.

Don't look for him. He's doing fine. He's gotta girl. He's fuckin' her right now in Steven's parents' room. So do ya know Joe.

Nothen' B.

Na.

Yeah. Do it again.

Hold on.

At the block party?

You were?

She won't? Why not?

Come on.

I like you too.

I don't want you to hurt me.

Do you care about me?

Fine Fidget. What's all this?

Because I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby.

15.

But I only had sex with Telly.

Everything is wrong.

No.

Yeah. I was gonna write a book but I can't spell.

It's Jennie. Just tell me if Telly is there.

I know.

Yeah. And then it hits that little thing.  That little punch bag. What is it? The tonsils. The esophagus, whatever.

Good luck.

That's it. I'm gonna have to tell my little brother, I'm gonna die. I can't make him his lunches anymore.

I only did it once and...

No. I just gotta go find him.

I don't know. Just some messy little scrap. You know that bullshit.

Yeah. She should be at Nasa tonight. Why you lookin for him? You like him now or sometin'?

Whah?

I no understand you. Maybe crazy.

But then the sex gets into the way and you're like: What happened! What the hell happened?!

Yeah.

He still does.

Shh.

Four-thirty in the morning?

It's me. Telly.

Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.

To come?

Come on Steven hook me up. Do me this solid.  Come on man. I gotta get Darcy alone. She's gonna let me fuck her man. Please.

Chess tournaments can be boring sometimes.  People have a lot of free time.  They like to gossip.

It means, if I were a killer and I thought the police were closing in on me I might invent someone to try and put them off the scent.

No.

He says it's a game.  All games have a strategy.

His victims aren't random.  It only means that they appear to be random. There's a connection, we just have to find it.

What?

You don't have an investigation without me.  You got that?

I used to.  With my old man.  He taught me how to hunt and trap.  Trapping's a lot harder than most people think.  We used to go after Raccoons mostly. They'd get into our garbage, our fields.  When an animal can't live peacefully with those around it, it has to be destroyed.  But they're crafty little devils.  You see the trick is, you can put your trap down, but no Raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent.  You ever smell Raccoon scent?  Smells like shit, but to a male Raccoon it smells just like pussy.  He'll walk right up to that trap, even though it don't look nothing like a Raccoon and stick his Goddam head right in it.  You know why?  Cause he can't help himself.  The scent drives him.  So, if you want to catch a Raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is -- lay down the scent -- and sooner or later he'll walk right into the trap.

I gotta friend over there.  He was telling me things are kind of slow. So, I figured I'd give him a call, have him come down here and look through your records.  You know, give him something to do.

Local?

Check with the State.  If he's never killed outside of Washington the F.B.I. wouldn't have it.  Nolan?

Sanderson?

It's a voice modulator.

I've got a feeling we're going to go the distance with him.  Let him sweat for a little while.

You weren't mad at him for picking up the phone?

I don't know.  Maybe there's two of them.  Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls.

Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!

What was suspicious about him?

Oh, c'mon.  We're not going to spend any more time on this crap, are we?  It doesn't mean anything.  It's Sanderson!

You couldn't find your dick in a wind storm!

That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself.  Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions.

Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter?  I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight.

Not really.

I really wish you'd stop trying to maneuver me.  I find it irritating, not to mention insulting.

So is mine, within the framework of my rules.

Very good.

The police haven't told you?

The game's over.  You lost.

You told me.  When you called you said she was in the other room.  Drop the knife.

Set up some pieces on the big board?

New York.  1986.  Viktor Yurilivich.

The scars on your chest.  From where I stabbed you with my fountain pen.

You could have been honest with me for starters.  We work together.  I have to be able to trust you.

How come the police never had a record of Sanderson before.  This doesn't come out of nowhere, there has to be a history.

He was watching you.

How do you know that?  Did he say something?

My cheering section.

That has nothing to do with it.

No, but he did contact a dead parcheesi champion from Ohio.

Who's Kathy?

Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in.

Not much.  I don't think she was raped. There's no bruising, or any signs of trauma to the pelvic region -- and no trace of sperm which makes sense because she took a bath.

I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a psychic.  What's this all about anyway?

Well, the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority -- and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim.

Meaning?

I thought that Homesearchers was a dead end?

He moves around a lot.  Why?

No.  He was wearing a mask... but I saw the cut on his wrist.  It was Peter.

I don't know.  I was afraid there'd be hours of questions.  I can't afford to miss a game.

We've already met.  Haven't we... Doctor.

"Wee Willie Winkie runs though the street."  We think he might be making a reference to himself.

That's all he needs.  He's making the moves.  It's an opening.  I just can't remember the name.  Okay, it's a game.  He's starting it, so he moves first.  He's white.  e2-e4.

It's over, Peter.  Let's stop the games.  I'm not sending a car.

He knows you're aware of that.

You don't win by playing it safe, Peter.

Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it.

I want to be the best I can.

What are they, please?

Yes.

Not really.  You see your goal and you go after it.  Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed.

Chess is a reflection of life.  Life is violent.  The strong win.  The weak perish.

Getting too hot in here for you?

Did you think it was going to be easy? You think he was going to lay it out at your feet?

I don't think I could.

Does what's going on bother you at all? Or are you just wearing your game face?

How can you look at it so clinically?

I think it's best if we don't ask too many personal questions -- I want to keep things on a professional level.

I just wanted to know if you're involved with anyone?  Let me ask you something?  Do your colleagues know if you're involved or not?

How the hell can I relax after seeing what I just saw.

You know, Andy thinks you're doing this.

I dunno.  Where's Erica mother?

It must've been very hard on Erica?

What are you talking about?  You don't even know me.

Then show me who you are.

What's wrong?

How could you think that, Kathy?  How could you even consider it?

But what does he mean by a fierce magazine?  Violent?

What?

I want someone I can get close to. I don't know if that's possible with you.

It could be anything.

Of course not.

I got lucky.

You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You're nervous?

Well, you should be, because this time I'm going to win.

I don't have to go through with it either.

Oh. That.  I know what you mean.  I had nightmares all week.

That's worse.

I don't know how.

Move quickly. We are coming for you. We are in the Fortress.

Come quickly, Colwyn. I can see the eyes of the Beast.

But there is another entrance to this place.

Reach out farther. Call to her.

The Fortress moves?

Like you, she has extraordinary powers. He would make her his Queen.

You are young. You don't understand the attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting.

Where the spiral begins.

Cut. <u>Cut</u>!

I forbid you!

What business?

He saved our lives.

Smart as well as quick. Now what do you have to give us?

How did you know I had sons?

Hah! You don't know me, boy.

You will follow me.

Why do they burn the villages? There's nothing to gain.

These we'll pay for.

Hand over your dinner.

Those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men.

At the gallop!

Would you settle for a boar?

I am Quell.

You can have half.

I only want one.

First, you desert me, and now you mock me. Go back to your one-eyed friend.

Would you desert your friends?

Get me down from here you louts or I'll turn you all into pigs!

We have plenty of hares.

Look at its insides.

And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?

No. He will master the leader.

Barak is still strong in the north, and Tendo holds the high passes. But the great desert forts have fallen.

Yes. We lost five.

Yes. It is the Western Ocean.

No. They are sad, solitary creatures, rarely seen.

There's an Emerald Circle a few leagues from here.  We'll find her.

Yes.  Like you, a King. A King of many worlds. All enslaved.

The Widow of the Web?

It is no trickery.

Then the other Lyssa will share your fate. She will grow old in the Fortress as you have grown old here.

Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see.

No.

...What?

Yeah.

Dirty work, and I kill no women and no kids.

Pay attention to women, Leon.  They are dangerous, you know?

Listen, think about what you want to do, but don't worry, your money is there and it's safer than in a bank... Banks are robbed every five minutes!

How can you say it?

What, for example?

What if you can't approach the car or he changes car?

How do you know it's love, if you've never been in love before?... It may be friendship... or the love you can have with a brother or a father... How can you know?

Yes.

Why?

OK... And if it's you who gets killed?  ...Then?  Talking about other people's death is easy, but what about yours? She's here! She moves around you, and can get you in a thousandth of second. Because it was your day, your hour, your second...

Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?

Mathilda?!

Piddle. She smiles and looks for the bathroom. She finds it and is going to go in when she sees the head of a man in the bath, walkman on. She withholds a shout and gets against the wall, without moving. She doesn't dare passing before the open door again to join Leon. In the living room, Leon still thinks.

...You're young, Mathilda... You still have a chance to get out.  You can't give up this chance. You have to protect it. There's a lot of things to do in life, a lot of other jobs...

I prefer waiting for a while...  I feel it would go the wrong way.

...Don't you like me?

...Yes. The day he got out of jail. I allowed him to make ten steps... No more. And bang. Two hundred meters. By telescope. That night, I left my country and came here, to join my father, who worked for Tony.  ...I was 17. Then, I never left the city...  And never had another girlfriend...

...Yes.

It will take them five minutes!  How long ago did they arrive?

Let me work. We'll get out, I tell you!

Mathilda, listen!

Not at all, Mathilda! I tell you because it's true! You'll buy the globe you told me about and you will choose, OK? We'll go where you want! I swear, you'll see, Mathilda!!

It's not me, it's dark here... and I can't find the switch.

Fine...

Huh? That's smart!

Huh, that's good!

Huh?

Huh? Why?

Yeah, but I don't give a shit about.  I trade at left, at right and that's dangerous in there...

No... Dino's.

No...

I respect your business, Mister Tony. Every time we asked your help, we were very happy with the result.  It's right this that makes me nervous, now.  I hope you'll excuse my temporary bad mood?

I have to walk -- by myself -- all the way -- every inch.

I'll make it.

Put out a P.B.S.... Or whatever it's called.

I think my uncle is suffering from a condition called Mania which is linked with depression.  It is a time when an individual will act over-confident, and will act out impractical, grandiose plans. Sometimes these plans can be dangerous.

Thank you.

You need a ride, Preacher?

Can it kill me?

Pardon?

There was no card.

It's just a regular day.

What?

Exactly.  No reason.  No occasion. It just makes you feel good to do something for it, to express your pride and affection for it some how...  How come you'd do that for a piece of metal and not for me?

Please tell me.

Where?

When I was ten, my family lived in Pacifica for a year.  I used to go to the beach everyday that summer. I never felt so happy, carefree. It was a magic place for me... That's where my heaven will be.

I asked the officers if you had committed some crime... If they had said 'yes', you would be speaking with them right now.

His name is Maurice.  He's dancing around everything else.

If he's in trouble with the law -- fine.  Not our problem.  He yanked two people from a car wreck, let's give him some space.

This guy's not a murderer.

I'm Isaac... I'm three.

You know what... maybe I ran onto the field and hit a home run.

You know what -- that was a really good story... Tell it again.

What was that?

By car right?

Maybe.

No.  No... I won't be here for a while.  The store will be closed in the interim.

I said, 'I would do anything for her'... and she didn't believe me. I said, 'I'd walk across the country for her'... she didn't believe me.

What Mr. Parker?

Saluting.

No more words.  Until I touch the ocean with my hands... it's all just words.

Where am I?

Which hospital?  Did you take me back?

Steph.

I need your help.

Did you tell him everything you wanted to?  Did you do everything you could while he was here?

You should.  Children are a blessing from God.  I have four.

Confused.  I'm not sure what to do now.  I'm not sure what he wants for me.

What do you mean?

It's yours.

What are my choices?

Not really. My room's not far. The Whole Year Inn. You can drive with me if you want...

You what?

I don't care about that. There's time left. You can have more money. You can drink all you want. You can talk or listen. Just stay, that's all I want.

I was looking for you tonight. I don't know if you have a boyfriend...

Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to.

Seriously, Ben... I need to keep pretty low-key around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That was the landlord.

Because... it's better for me that way. OK?

Thanks, I do understand. I was worried about how that would be... but now I'm not. And you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job.

Do you want to go gambling tonight? We could go out and play for a few hours.

I expect some kind of loyalty here. Just because I fuck for money doesn't give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly.

That's impressive. How did you do that?

Yes... I'll give you that.

I didn't know I'd ever need it again.

Oh, Ben... you look so very sick... my love... you're so pale.

Yes.

How much, do you think?

I've been all right.

Where have you been staying?

Yes, of course. How much do you need?

Like I said... it was a slow night... I'm sorry. It was hard to score.

That's right.

I can't give you that. And if you put me on the stand, I'll lie.

You took my class in LA. You had the best high kick I've ever seen. Are you one of my lawyers?

I'm glad it's you and not Donovan.

Whatever it is -- it could save you.

I know! You helped me go from a six to a four!

I guess.

Yes.

She's younger than I am. Did she tell you that? How would you feel if your father married someone younger than you?

Tell him, Paulette.

I'm impressed that you took the initiative to go there and get it. That's what makes a good lawyer. And on top of that, you gained the client's trust and kept it. That's what makes a great lawyer. You're smart, Elle. Smarter than most of the guys I have on my payroll.

Yes, I am.

Oh, yes. Mrs. Windham is the most sweet, wonderful woman I know. I have loved her since the day she hired me. She could never do something this awful. I know this because we are very close.

See?

I don't know.

That's terrible!

What's the point of staying? All people see when they look at me is blonde hair and big boobs. No one's ever going to take me seriously. The people at law school don't, Warner doesn't -- I don't even think my parents take me seriously. They wanted me to grow up and become a Victoria's Secret model who marries a rock star. Now, for the first time, it seemed like someone expected me to do something better with my life than wear underwear for a living. But I was kidding myself -- Donovan didn't see me as a lawyer. He saw me as a piece of ass just like everyone else. It turns out, I am a joke.

Relation?

Name?

You know her?

Oh, God, was this like an RSVP thing?

Too bad you and I are the only ones.

I know. He has it sent out.

You think?

Serious?! Who the hell does he think he is? You're the most popular month on the USC calendar!

Your scrunchie?

Why, yes, Margot, I do. Once again, we joined Hope in the search for her identity. As you know, she's been brainwashed by the evil Stefano --

What?!

I can't believe you guys are actually here -- but this case is important. I'll make it up to you after finals, okay? I -- promise. I really want to do a good job.

Neat.

I wasn't gonna --

Did your daughter ever say anything to you about Brooke and Heyworth's relationship?

I'm quitting.

Are you asking me on a date?

I just don't understand what went wrong --

What, like on va-kay?

Oh, my God! I completely forgot to tell you!

Why not?

You're applying for my internship, aren't you?

You should. Do you have a resume?

And engraved... Gives it that extra little something, doesn't it?  See you tomorrow!

Of course, I do!

That's why I think it's time for us to --

Harvard. Law school.

Sarah was my girlfriend at prep school. We got back together over the summer at my grandmother's birthday party.

But what? We took the same LSAT, we take the same classes --

I gave her my word, Warner.

Really?

A restaurant in Oakland. Where no one would recognize us.

Chuck.

I have something far more pleasant awaiting me.

Your words sting more sharply than your whip.

You are cruel!  Your heartless jesting worse than torture!  How can you speak of love when you see what I am!

What do you want from me?

I don't expect you'd understand.

Indeed I am, my dear... that makes us a pair!

From the parapets most likely.  The men are amused by a battlefield entertainment of my own contriving.

Precisely, my darling.  Your animal strength, your primitive power has surfaced... you are what you desire.

So you shall be... Like our brothers, the hawk and the wolf, our spirits know no master... we are created in the pure image of the savage God that set our turbulent universe in motion.

East of Mercia?

It's terrible.

I need your help.  In order to fight Blackheart, I must wear the armor of Achilles.  I --

Honeythorn Gump, is it?  I've not seen your ugly face since you sold me a jug of cow piss claiming it was dragon's tears.

Gump, is it?

Faerie ring?

Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?

Well... I... I don't want to be rude, but... it's generally known that --

Aye.  Honeythorn Gump'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer.

If you're looking for enchantment, Jack, that I can give thee...

How is it this hag knows the truth?

I know where to find it.  Taking possession be another matter.

Better we eat him than the other way round.

No false modesty, lad.  You're a proper champion.  Achilles' armor sits on you like it was forged to fit.

What know you of fields of war?

Your imagination runs away with you, Jack... Those bones be but battlefield gleanings, like I mentioned.  A wee bit of carrion to frighten off the uninvited.

God protect you, Honeythorn Gump.

We'll surely be in our graves if we don't.

Nay.  I show no pity to imps and fiends.

Aye, so long as you're not too greedy for the bait.

Defend ourselves.  We've bested far worse already.

Faerie magic's no match for a sorcerer's power... We have Ogg's gifts, the key and the --

Fire away!

Can you save her?

I admire your valor, Jack.  By all means, seek him out... But first, we needs visit the kitchen.

Listen to him.  Not in the mood...

Screwball!  Be quiet...!  We have friends live 'neath the Needle. They'll no doubt provide safe refuge for the night.

Gonna make ogre-stew!

You'll do it because I am you liege and I command you to do it!

Oh, Jack, you are a wild man to use me so.

If you like.

Never.

Be patient.

In these woods you are a commoner. Now be quiet.  True royalty approaches.

Are you honest?

To fetch your napkin.

My father and the Baron.

A maid must beware of flattery... Methinks you want to kiss me.

Let it.  Haven't you a cozy bower we might hide in?

Then, perchance you'll me.

That's why he goes masked during the day...

Whilst you were sleeping, I fetched your ring.

Is what you said about the ring but another dream?

You're teasing still.

Pinching me!

Everywhere!  Ow!

Thought the weather terrible of late.

Another hero's hand-me-down... Thurgis, note the armor; tis Greek work.

They call me Green Jack, ma'am.

Aye.  And it is the trouble befallen us that brings me here.  I entreat you to tell me the cause of our surrounding sorrow, most lovely of the lovely.

You'll need the fastest steed alive, for Couer de Noir's castle rests at the very edge of the earth.  Only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of Achilles will protect you from his fury.

Follow the raven in her flight, Follow old black wing to the edge of night...

Come sit beside me, sweet boy, and I'll draw you a map.

Then, tis not for chastity? Methought you kept a naked blade twixt you and any maiden chanced spend the night.

Pray you be sweet as your words, dear Jack.

You... you... you mortal you!

Why should I feel such pain?  Should be the other way round... I could vex you... make you dance your life away...

I know where to find him... He lies out on the marsh, raven-fodder; his horn torn from his head.

Bah!  You faeries have the morals of ferrets.

Haven't heard a bird sing in days...

Oh, but I have.

May God protect you.

To Castle Couer de Noir?

What are you doing?

I thought I might stop by.

We can work.

Since seventh grade.

He's here.  Check the bathroom.

I'd be more comfortable if you hadn't slept with Josh.  And George would be more comfortable if he weren't dying.

I'll survive.

No.

Why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage?

He's not gay.  I found out purely by accident, believe me.

Hi.

Your dad's really gonna build his house?

He jumped into the ocean.

You look better without make-up.

Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom.

No thanks.

What are you talking about?

What you think, you know, doesn't have much to do with reality.  I mean, I hope I'm not the first to say that about you.

Okay.  I guess.

He wants the entire roof taken off and lowered.

It's thirty feet.

How's your wife?

I did tell you, didn't I?  That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today?

That's too long.

I was a sophomore when I got the call my parents were dead.

We're getting out of the ground today.

The plumber's due out on Friday.

Where are you?  You're driving me crazy, waiting like this.  I want you in me now!

I don't know.

Why would you be there?

You'll know me by the time we're through.

You don't have a choice.

Goodnight.

Why?

I'd blame you.  I want you here.

I'd rather sell my nuts to a castrati.

I don't know.

The gloves on the table are for you.

Hi, Mom.

I know.  Why?

He was a prick when I was six, and he's a prick today.

Don't be.  And hide whatever that new drug is you have.  I like it.

I was just thinking about my mom.  She wouldn't leave him.  I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses.  I mean it was dark outside and in.  But we never talked about it.

That's so weird...

You lied to me!

Good for you.

I'd build a house.

We just weren't very much alike, I guess. I don't know.  I liked your dad more than I liked you.

Thanks for telling me.

Check the permits.  It was built as a guesthouse.  It's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when South Laguna was incorporated.

Three.

Oh.  Sorry.

She needs to be alone, I think.

You didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat?!

Why would they tow your truck?

Why call me?

You've been saying that for twenty years. While we were dating, you said it.

Where will you live?

Look, I wasn't serious about you taking Sam, so you don't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it.

Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.

I want him with me.

I don't have a phone.

Let's go.

What?

We have it on video!  Was that when?  My parents were down for his sixth birthday! I remember that.

My tongue around the edge of his ear is what cured him.

No.  Why?  I like to be with Sam.

I'll say a lot of things I've never said before.  It's habit.

I didn't think you'd come today.

Is Lois still here?  I'm starved.

Should I?

Lois will stay with them.  Or we can pawn them off on your parents.

Good.  That was the plan.  We couldn't stand him and George needed help.

I never asked for more.

That was my plan...to be hardly recognizable to you as me.

Hey.

Why?

Okay.

I didn't go in your room.

Then maybe this isn't what he wants, but this what he was hoping for.  Maybe it's what I want.

Can we really help build a house?

Someone stop her!

Nigger.

Is Mae Rose okay?

What am I gonna do out there, Ray? I can't go home to my mama like this. I'll get the strap for sure.

Kid's getting out. I got him a pardon.

I did, Claude. I mentioned you. I mentioned you both. But the fact is, pardons don't come cheap. The kid can hit. What can you do?

My name's Yvette. Sylvia sent me. You look just like she said.

Sure, boss.

I was hoping you were gonna say an engagement ring, Claude.

He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th Street, and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job.

Why would you want to go home? It's so early.

Claude Banks.

Why didn't you take it?

There is no Boom-Boom Room.

Look, ma'am, we've been driving all day. We'd just like to purchase one of those pies and we'll be on our way.

Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a load of those crackers? Couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight with people like that for?

What'd you say?

Yeah, I want some pie.

He even got my daddy's watch.

He's dead.

My daddy's watch. This is the dude I was telling you about --

Shut up. It's too damn hot. What do you know, anyway?

Somebody just told me he wins the three-legged race every year.

He does it all by himself.

No, I don't like it here. Look around. There's nothing but ass. Male ass! Balls and ass! Believe you me, I'm getting out of here.

My daddy always said when a man starts talking about the weather keep you hand on your wallet.

We? Did I hear you say we? As I recall, you're the one who said there is no we. Guess we got some bad news in that letter, huh?

You know what, Claude? This whole time we've been down here, you've done nothing but think about yourself, acting like this whole thing is my fault. That plan with your cousin, did that include me?

Absolutely. The map is very clear.

The hell you talking about? What train?

They must be the right people. Whoa, there goes the hot dog man. Let's get a couple. Damn, that smells good. Nothing like a ballpark hot dog, huh?

Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today?

They're called pilots! I'm serious, Ray. I'm not in the mood for one of your stupid, fucked-up plans right now.

My plan is on his way to Pittsburgh right now. That congenital idiot just got himself a pardon signed by the governor thanks to us, but we can't seem to do nothing for ourselves. Don't you feel a little disgusted right now?

That was five years ago.

Don't touch that car.

Go where, Ray?

Some faces you just don't forget. Warren Pike's is one of 'em.

Why the hell not?

Hell of a day, Ray. Yankees are on fire.

So?

Yeah? You and what army?

I'm all right.

'Preciate it. Claude.

You killed Santa Claus?

Made just for you, Cookie.

State of Mississippi wants this ditch cleared by sundown. You got that?!

Judge gave 'em the long ride.

I seen the bodies before they sealed 'em up. Them fellas sizzled up good. Looked like some shit from the X- Files.  Damn, that shit's nasty.

I think that old man lost his marbles about a hundred years ago. Come on, let's get this over with.

Just like Elvis.

It'll be too late.

I'm going in for him. He'd do the same for me.

Are you offering me a bribe?

Anybody else need anything read?

They're called subways. A nickel will take you from one end of Manhattan to the other. Helluva ride, too.

You should have come by last night, Radio. You woulda had yourself some fun.

Me? Willie Long.

That's a long story...

You all been here a long time. Doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?

I'm talking about old Satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint.

You shouldn't have come here.

You mother...

Noon...

Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.

So excited.

Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.

You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life.

Show him Central Park.

Maybe try the opposite of that.

An angel?

She's so nice.

I'm not a hundred percent on that. God said when the time comes, you'll know what to do.

No.

I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.

Great. Now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side. But I misplaced it.

The shit has hit the fan, kid. Take a look.

You did it for Namath.

Definitely.

Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester.

And I also happen to be a Jets fan.

Son, just do your best.

What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?

That's a pretty brassiere.

I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.

Oh, would you grow up.

The Dark Prince is here.

We're going to see Ozzy play at the Meadowlands, right now. Wanna come, Nicky?

Peppermint... alright.

That way.

Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one.

Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. Later on.

You followed him?

Dude, it's us. Let us in.

No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.

Oh. Sorry, Andrew. Valerie?

My dad's an optometrist.

That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.

It's not that cold. Here, let me wrap it.

I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.

I'm not sure. I'd ask him, but he's uptown talking to his contacts.

What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?

Sometimes, sure.

Nicky? Oh my God. Stay right there.

That was Cassius!

From my dad's side of the family.

I love you.

A black guy?

Sir, I would prefer if you didn't raise your voice. It's making my muscles tighten.

You walked in. I saw you. Don't you remember?

From? From? From?

Up there.

Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.

Did you?

I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that...

No, Holly -- wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!

Holly. Holly! Please... The other Sandman. Remember the one who came after --

...and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him...

No.  Just no.

No.

I changed my mind.

How a Sandman lives.

I didn't say that I would run... I just...

Six. I go red next year.

You know.

You know something.

It's different now. Help me.

A Runner gave it to me.

Speak to your friends for me, Jessica... please...

What do you need?

You're not going, are you?

I don't remember exactly... except I was a Green.  What would you like to relive, Logan?

All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner.

That's nothing... there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them.

He had a mother and father -- and he knew them.

You're lying! You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! You'll be killed the moment you're seen!

You want to go back to kill, is that it?! Now, you'll want to kill your own!!! Kill Sandmen!!! Killing's all you ever...!!!

Sanctuary is the right to live... nothing more. But nothing less, either...

Mother and Father said so... you know?

At least it's over...

We'll remember. But that's a long time off...

It's all right with me. Is he here?

Not yet.

Alive?

Thank you.  Tell me -- what do those words mean? "Beloved husband"... "Beloved son"... "Beloved wife"...

Yes...

Oh my... I'll try.

It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.

No. Jessica goes back now. Take her back.  Now! Go on back. Back outside, Jessica.

I don't think so.

Sheila'll be at "Tops".

No, I'm okay.

Sure, I'm okay.

Maid? Relative?

And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.

As best we can.

Or something.

Or not so recently?

You know what I think?

I can't see you tonight.

No, honey... It was part of the deal.

He works for Mr. Eddy.

He makes films for Mr. Eddy.

Pete... Don't...

No... A job... I didn't know what. He set up an appointment for me to see a man.

Yeah. Call him.

Okay.

Alice?

I don't know his name. He's a friend of Dick Laurent's, I think.

Sure.

Nice to know they can't seem to get along without ya.

You really don't remember the other night, do you?

Sit down a minute.

Yeah? what did they want?

But I don't remember anything. What did you tell 'em?

No... Here he comes.

We'll get a tail put on him.

He won't give his name.

I don't know yet.

SIX FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS... THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIX FUCKIN' FEET, MISTER! YOU WERE FOLLOWING TEN FEET BEHIND ME... IF I'D HAD TO STOP SUDDENLY, YOU WOULD HAVE HIT ME. I WANT YOU TO GET A DRIVER'S MANUAL, AND I WANT YOU TO STUDY THAT MOTHERFUCKER... AND I WANT YOU TO OBEY THE GOD DAMN RULES. FIFTY FUCKIN' THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE KILLED ON THE ROAD LAST YEAR.  CAUSE OF FUCKIN' ASSHOLES LIKE YOU. TELL ME YOU'RE GONNA GET A MANUAL.

FUCKIN' "A".

Let's have a look at the hallway outside the bedroom.

The first night... Not the last two.

No, no. I want to go in.

What do you mean? You're where right now?

I like to laugh, Fred.

I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.

That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.

Two detectives are coming out.

What?

Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out here?

No... Thank you!... I'll be bringin' the "Caddy" by tomorrow.

You're doin, okay?  That's good, Pete.

Great question!! In the east... the far east... when a person is sentenced to death... they're sent to a place where they can't escape... never knowing when an executioner will step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head... it could be days... weeks... or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced... This uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the situation, don't you think? It's been a pleasure talking to you.

Guess we're goin' over to the "Ten Pin".

Whatiya mean?

Sure. Sure I do.

I don't want to talk about it...

No... I really don't want to talk about it.

Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?

Come on.

Yes. Might as well - all of it.

Let me have it.  "Aboard the S.S. Manchuria. Last night Conway seemed to recover his memory. Kept talking about Shangri- La, telling a fantastic story about a place in Tibet. Insisted upon returning there at once. Locked him in room but he escaped us and jumped ship during night at Singapore. Am leaving ship myself to overtake him, as fearful of his condition. Wrote down details of Conway's story about Shangri-La which I am forwarding. Lord Gainsford."

Thank you.

Fossils.

You see, from this vertebrae I shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton.

Sir Henry Derwent was knighted, and he never got beyond the mesozoic era.

Okay, sister.  No offense. No offense!

I beg your pardon.

Do you suppose we stopped someplace during the night and changed pilots?

Will you stop squawking!

That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.

Please don't call me Lovey.

Mr. Conway, I don't like this place. I don't like it. It's too mysterious.

As a matter of fact, I'm very good at double solitaire.

Uh-huh.  Did you ever hear of Chalmers Bryant?

Okay, Lovey.

Horns? What kind of horns?

So that's where you are. I might of known it. No wonder you couldn't hear me.

This doesn't obligate me in any way.

In a quandary.

Wonder what's happened to Fenner.

Bryant's Utilities - that's me.

All right.

No.

Say, listen - will you go and annoy the rest of your playmates? Let me alone!

I think I'll stick around. I'll leave with the porters on their next trip.

Thank you.

So there are others?

We follow many.

Suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not?

A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault, the first European to find this place, and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri-La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault.

You're startled?

I mean, your amazement. I could have understood it in any of your companions, but you - who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds. Or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it?

Shall we have another?

Yes, charming.

No, I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would happen?

I can't let him go alone. It's suicide!

Don't preach that cheap, second- hand stuff to me!  Go on, beat it. Beat it!

Well, we've been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years.

Pardon me

How can we get in touch with them?

Yes.

No, Mr. Conway, I'm not lying. What reason could I have for lying? The chances are that we'll never come out of that horrible trip alive, but I'd rather die out there in a snowstorm and be buried alive, than to stay here one more minute now.

Yes, of course. Certainly. Come on!

Oh, the girl at the piano?

Of course I have suspected that our being here is no accident. Furthermore, I have a feeling that we're never supposed to leave. But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet that when it comes. What particularly interests me at present is, why was I brought here? What possible use can I be to an already thriving community?

Mine?

Aha - very good, Freshie.[3] Very good. You'd better put his name on the list and make out a report later.

It means we're in unexplored country - country nobody ever reached.

What are you talking about?

What do you mean if we should get out?

There must be some connection between the plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. Why, Bob? What reason could they have for doing a thing like that?

Nothing about the porters yet?

I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.  I guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners.

Then you'd better go, George. This is no place for you.

She's going with me.

I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!

Can't you shut up? Must you go on babbling like an idiot?

What if he refuses?

Brilliant!  Can anyone here fly a plane?

Oh, you mean my pigeons.

I saw a man whose life was empty.

Oh, I know. It was full of this and full of that. But you were accomplishing nothing. You were going nowhere, and you knew it.

You're absolutely right. And I had to come all the way to a pigeon house in Shangri-La to find the only other person in the world who knew it. May I congratulate you?

Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.

Yes, I know.

On the contrary, you're not strange. And that in itself is confusing. I have the same idea about Shangri- La. The sense that I've been here before, that I belong here.

I can't quite explain it, but everything is somehow familiar. The very air that I breathe. The Lamasery, with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley, while its head explores the eternal. All the beautiful things I see, these cherry blossoms, you - all somehow familiar.  I've been kidnapped and brought here against my will. A crime, a great crime, yet I accept it amiably, with the same warm amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend. Why? Can you tell me why?

You see, it's not a dream.

Struggling, why?

I was just going to.

Why, mother?

I'd love it!

It's Fenner.

I don't know. I'm a paleontologist, not a Foreign Secretary.

Go? Where?

Well, I dunno.  I mean, when you looked at all the other options... it just seemed sorta obvious.

Oh, you'll still, be guarding him.

And if I say yes?

No-- it makes sense.  Cause I gotta tell ya, when I was in third grade they told me I was crazy cause I swore that our teacher was from, like, Venus or something.

Yes, air.  But I'm usually wrong. Sir.

Kay...

Sir, you can't just--

This is a college?  I'm sorry, I thought it was a carnival.

You don't know the half of it.

Why?

You don't know me at all.

It's an Edna named after Zed's ex wife.  All you do is at the target. The scope matches the image with the image on your retina. The barrel will find the target on its own.

And what's this ... ?

Where to?

I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds.

I think that's what's happening...

We're rising.

Well, if the bugs have hatched, and they're not here... then where are they?

In case I need it.

There wasn't time, sport!

I haven't been training a partner -- I've been training a replacement.

Or what's no horrible down here that everyone's trying to avoid It?

Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work.

What is it?

What do we do?    Lean into it.

Are you sure you don't?

You figured what?

I dunno. One?

It's... coming.

Yeah, Kay?

Noon exactly.

Scientific American?  Really?

Yeah.  Nov I know it looks normal, but watch this.

May I have a look?

Come again?

Seriously.  I'm not going any further until you tell who you are.

Fine.  Good.

So whattya say, kid?  You in or out?

Keep an eye on things there.  We'll see what we can find out at Ernie Goosels.

What do we have?  Are we showing anything?

Oh shit!

Just a guess.  But I think found a nest.

If I may, sir... what exactly are you offering?

He'll turn around.

Wait.

I can't leave.  You said so yourself, there is no Minority Report.  I don't have an alternative future.

Who wanted her little girl back?

She's still alive?

Anne Lively...

Right.  I know --

Baltimore.  Eastside.  Solomon P. Eddie M.D.  I was a plastic surgeon.

Drowning.

Try again.

So she cleaned up.  Where is she now?

Hang on, Lamar --

I'm fine.

I'm fine, Lamar.

We won't let them.

And who the hell is that?

All right, John, just take a breath, let's think about this...

Red Ball -- double homicide: one male, one female.  Killer's male, white, 40's.

Come on, Chief, you think about it, the way we work -- changing destiny and all -- we're more like clergy than cops.

Yes, it is.

Because it was going to fall.

Then why can't they see rapes, or assaults... or suicides?

Speaking of interfacing, I'd love to say hello.

Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?

I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night.

It helps if you don't think of them as human.

I need your help.

I need help with her.

No.  No way.  I wouldn't even know where to begin!  Those thoughts about my cousin Elena -- they were just thoughts. I would never --

I know that.  I know you would have done anything to find me.  I know you would have died for me.

Some -- somebody's father?

NO!

No.

What the fuck is going on?

The what?

I'm... not... a... killer.

If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime.

And how did Lamar become involved?

I'm not a murderer.  I've never even met the man I'm supposed to kill.

Lara, I don't know why this is happening.  I just know they're setting me up.  I can't trust anybody.  I don't know who to talk to or where to go...  Lara?  Are you there?

I thought you were retiring?

Anne Lively.  John was talking about her right before they took him.

Sean --

I'll be right there.

The Mets.  John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree.

The man lost a child, for Christ's sake...

What?

Wait, just a second...

Danny, tell me what you're thinking.

Yes.

No, I wanna kill my boss!

Not after the vote next week.  Once the Amendment passes, we go national, there's gonna be nowhere to run.

Somehow, I don't think that was Walt Whitman.

We can stop him.

He can't download her without a lot of technical help.

They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them.

Who?

I'd love to, but I've got an open house today at the Ressler place.

I know who you are.

Yes.

Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?

Have you been there recently?

You mean after he lost your son.

He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what?  You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.

I haven't seen him in two years.

You don't understand... they're a hive mind.  It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.

They were grabbing her fucking ass --

When served warm --

No. That's cool. Bring me back eighty.

He's okay.

No more.

Ricky, can you put on a seat belt?

Chloe?

Easy night. Bachelor party. Can we give Wendy a ride?

The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.

Leave me alone. I haven't touched anything in months.

Listen to me, Bobby. This is my job. It puts a roof over me and my daughter and you for as long as you want to stay.

Just so you know, I bought you out with Maxie. I suggest you leave while you can.

Come on, dude. The other chick's giving my best man a blow job in the toilet. I know the drill, I'll wear a rubber --

You driving her?

She'll be out in a minute.

Nah, man. He's just making contact. That's our man. The Welsh guy.

To be honest, man, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now.

This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause he's a Shot Caller.

A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit.

We go and hang out with the dude, make him happy, drink some tea, whatever it takes, until he feels comfortable enough to bring it up on his own. We make the drop, go home to California.

We meet at the Globe on Park Avenue at six forty-five. I'll see you then.

Yeah?

They ran shit back in the Eighties. Used to cut motherfuckers heads off and sit them on the bar. That's back when the Irish was making a play against the Italians. I don't know if they still around, but I don't fuck with those motherfuckers just in case.

He was uptown when I paged him. I gave him the address. He's meeting us there.

Why?

That's why they call it the smart money.

Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.

What?

What about Ricky? He'd jump at the opportunity.

Not you. I want Ricky to answer.

I hate to ruin your fairy tale, but I've been paying Jess' rent for six months. She's got to keep dancing --

Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked?

Soho.

Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.

Well, this is the corner.

No. That's cool, man.

You know, white kids with trust funds acting like they're poor. Keeping it real. Know what I mean?

Yeah, he's getting there on his own.

Listen, man, we really gotta...

Ruiz isn't here.

Ruiz is always on the list. He just ain't here, though.

Thanks.

Don't be shitty.

I'll page you.

Yeah. I know the number.

I got no idea.

I will.

Shhh...

He didn't say we need guns.

It's not even yours.

Who's driving her?

Yeah, I guess.

Don't play dumb. You know what I'm talking about.

You think Maxie doesn't want us to roll hard? Why do you think he gave us all this bread? Or the number on the pager? We gotta represent him by showing some class. The man's got an operation. How does it reflect on him if we nickel and dime it?

You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?

I mean, that's what I heard --

Missing what? He didn't say shit.

What did I 'get?'

What's up?

I got a bad feeling, man. I don't want to go in naked.

Is it so unrealistic to think Ruiz, who doesn't even want us here, is throwing us to the wolves? As an apology? And I don't even know what we're dropping off or picking up --

Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?

We don't need guns.

You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun?

Eighty bucks?!?

Yes I did. You asshole! What about the room?

Let's just go now and wait.

I don't want to take any more chances.

Take us right to Kennedy. Now.

Bobby and Ricky.

That's a good idea, maybe I will!

You want your surprise?

You see a Ricky Slade?

What?

Maybe you wanna try the China Club.

He's on the list.

Ugh...

Where do you live?

I know what 'strapped' means, motherfucker. What the fuck you think this shit is? '21 Jump Street?'  Cool out, they're coming back. Just throw up your screw face and don't speak unless spoken to.

So we just go eat with him and that's gonna solve everything?

Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.

A little Charlie, perhaps.

Here...

Jimmy? Ruiz. Pick up Maxie's guineas at LUNA and bring them to Spa.  Jimmy's bringing the car around. Me and Ho rode sleds. We'll meet you at Spa in the VIP room.

You think this shit's funny, Ho?

Soho Grand, right?

Yeah. Grab one of the cards behind you. Call that number. It's my cell.

I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff.

We're square.

And where do we bring it?

She poured it for --

Unless spoken to, ain't that right, Horrace. Didn't you say that?

Four mimosas.  You'll love them. So here's the plan. I didn't say shit to Maxie, cause the man has acute angina, and I don't want to get him all worked up.

Mmmm-hmm. Where's the, uh, 'Dragon's lair?' Where do you live?

Well, word on the street is you're Welsh.

Yeah. This shit's fucking brilliant. I just fucking love the fact that you have kids driving around in pickup trucks with a mouthful of this shit, speeding their brains out. I gotta bring a case of it home to my mates. It's illegal back home, you know.

He had it coming.

'Cause I want in. And it don't take a lot to know you there, daddy.

Solid, daddy.

I'm working on it.

Yeah, and I'm putting my money where my ugly mouth is. I'm putting you back in the numbers right now.  Baby, what's today?

I'll take your goddam bet.

Then skip it, man. But you slipping, baby. You done slipped.

He gave it to you, Archie. He did.

Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.

Tell you this: you ain't no fool.

What do you do with your time?

Soiled with dirt, foul; sullen, hostile, forbidding -- as a black day. Foully or outrageously wicked, as black cruelty. Indicating disgrace, dishonor or culpability.

They sure ain't no black man's books in here.

You got to learn everything the white man says and use it against him. The truth is laying there if you smart and read behind their words. It's buried there. You got to dig it out.

Look 'em up and and out what they mean.

Read it and keep on reading.

Tell Him that.

"I'm telling you God's words, not to hustle."

Next week, Brother Minister.

If you want to tell me.

Let me explain. No. I'll do better than that. I'll show it to you. Scientifically. But it's demonstration purely in the interest of science, you understand?

I can handle it.

Why do you ask?

Are you?

I know.

You're with me even when you're away.

I'm not made of glass.

There are always slanders, always lies. You're reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the Messenger.

The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.

Shhh!

I'm tired of praying.

Malcolm, where are you? We've been calling all over the city.

What did I tell you about assuming?

The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.

I told you we don't know for certain.

Entirely.

Let me do it then.

I say a lot of things.

Mind your own goddamn business... She comes in a lot?

Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say you're running around town with her.

These are my children. Mine. And they ain't no question. None.

Your control over your children, therefore --

500.

How long has this been going on?

No. You'll be marked for death.

I won't let myself come between you and your father. Go home.

And don't come back.

Shhhh! I don't like women that talk.

Me?

Eat lead, coppers.

You're too small to be Bogart.

Yeah.

Might be all right.

That's right.

He told you that?

This is your room, Malcolm. I know you'll keep it clean.

I don't know shit about you.

[South America.]

[I'm on to Juarez.]

[I have a friend there.]

How do I contact you? We still don't have the ATM info.

[The boss did or his brother.]

[The ransom money. At the drop. He said Tazinari, one of the policemen had taken it. He was crazy.]

[Do you know who I am?]

[Who ordered it?]

[In the next hour, where do I find your partner?]

[Your brother wants to talk to you.]

[Listen! I will give you a life for a life.]

[And one of the founding members of La Hermanidad.]

Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.

Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?

Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap labor. Factory space. But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They think I'm John-fucking- Wayne.

Fuck, I love Mexico. I live like a king down here.

Not for eight months. I was in Columbia looking around, but, nothing seemed interesting.

Maybe...

You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you?

Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking.

I go to school, don't I?

It must be difficult having lots of wives.

[Yeah. Can you imagine my mother multiplied by a thousand?]

No, that was in Columbia.

Still not a question.

Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't think enough.

You should break all my fingers, Creasy, then tape them back together. I won't be able to play the piano, but I could still swim.

There's no such thing as tough, Creasy. Just trained and untrained.

We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.

You're paying me to protect her, not amuse her. Right?

Stay here. If you do something stupid, we won't get her back.

And now every mother with money in Mexico City wants bigger and better bodyguards. My own wife included.

Do you know what she told me last night?

[Yes.]

[No. Why?]

When?

This is Mr. Creasy.

You do?

You're going to miss Mexican Halloween. The Day of the Dead.

These people are professionals. They don't waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.

Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy.

He has to go.

[He's the man, 'the Boss?' My guys got into the house on the pretext of giving cholera shots. We had to inject the whole Barrio. We bugged the house and stole the picture of him.]

That's what friends do.

I can take care of myself.

What was she to Creasy then?

Listen. You people go grab a table. I'll be back inna minute. I'll be right back.

Which one was that?

She probably got a date by now, Angie.

I didn't like her, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.

My mother, boy, she drives me crazy.

It must be one o'clock.

Oh, I couldn't eat nothing. My mother just stuffed me right up to the jaws.

I don't feel like going, Angie. I thought I'd take this girl to a movie.

He was here last night till about two o'clock. I hear you really got stuck with a dog last night.

Angie. He says she was a real scrawny- looking thing.

I been getting a pain in my shoulder.

Do you remember Emilio DiGiorgio, owned the tavern in Abruzzi?

You know what they say. They say things are no good in this house. Catherine, your son is married. Leave him in peace. He wantsa be alone with his wife. They don't want no old lady sitting inna balcony. Now I tell you what I think. I want you come live with me in my house with Marty and me. In my house, you have your own room. You don't have to sleep onna couch inna living room like here. We will cook inna kitchen and talk like when we were girls. You are dear to me, and you are dear to Marty. We are pleased for you to come.

I think anything you want to do, you'll do well.

I really should get home...

No, thank you. I don't think I should stay very long.

Nothing.

Yeah. I was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl.

Sure, what?

Marty...

We just got here about fifteen minutes ago. Ma, I want you to meet Miss Clara Snyder. She's graduate of New York University. She teaches chemistry in Benjamin Franklin High School.

Oh, it's a sad business.  My sister, Catherine, she don't get along with her daughter-in-law, so she's gonna come live with us.

What, Ma?

She didn't look Italian to me.

You don't like her. You only met her for two minutes.

Hiya, Ralph...

Waddaya read there, Joe?

Hey, Louise, I want you to meet Marty Pilletti. Marty, that's Louise Kelly, inna back seat there.

She's right. She's right. Young husband and wife, they should have their own home. And my sister Catherine, she's my sister, but I gotta admit, she's an old goat. And plenty-a times in my life, I feel like throwing the milk bottle at her myself. And I tell you now, as far as I'm concerned, if Catherine wantsa come live here with me and Marty, it's all right with me.

Oh, Marty, thanks a lot. That really takes a load offa my mind.

Siddown, Thomas, siddown.

Aunt Theresa, you got this big house here. I mean, you got this big house just for you and Marty. And I thought maybe Tommy's mother could come here and live with you and Marty.

That's all right, that's all right...

How's Marty been lately, Aunt Theresa?

She don't wanna use my pots and pans!

You talked to Walt?

Didn't recognize you, Red. When you get the clamp all the way down, open it as wide as you can and see if you can close it on the artery.

Never this close.

Sure, you just blindfold him first and tie him to a stake.

Pour one for Painless.

Look at that right eye.

I've always had a hankering for blonde pussy myself. My wife's hair is a wonderful golden yellow, and this time of year it gets even lighter.

Four goddam months. And they don't even give you time off for good behavior.

Hey, you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging Bible!

Good, because we got a fine old American custom we want to teach you. You know what these are?

Perfectionist.

Shore Patrol, Duke. Let's go!

The spot we picked to spend the winter. Maybe we ought to look a little harder.

Nothing can't wait. Shall we check it out with the Major?

The chest-cutter.

Sixteen times.

Call Dago Red.

Good thinking, Duke. How about it, Ho-Jon? Can you round up a few of the boys?

You know damn well I nearly puke when I look at her. I don't even think she's a real blonde.

I not only say it, I'll back it up twenty buck's worth.

Yeah, if I can.

When?

We could steal one of the choppers.

Like the Spearchucker said, that's possible. Anyway, it's been an interesting association.

Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...

N-n-no thanks, G-General.

Now we're working out a schedule of the outfits we're going to play this year. We all chip into a pool and make bets.

I'm sure we could find a date for your team. Why don't I take it up with Henry?  Thanks for the drink, boys.

But weren't you supposed to meet the surgeons who are going to slice up the Congressman's son?

Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.

And if it isn't, why don't we call Washington on your telephone? You tell your story, we'll tell ours.

Radar!

You aspirate the blood from the chest cavity. Damn, there's more of it than I thought.

They're coming.

We can balance that by getting ourselves a ringer. Henry has to say he needs a neurosurgeon and put in a specific request for Dr. Oliver Harmon Jones.

I'm glad you feel that way, Major, because you see it's a team effort... doctors, nurses, enlisted men... and I feel responsible for my whole team, and I want you to know I'm satisfied with them.

Well, for college players that have been out of training seven or eight years...

We may be in trouble, I can't catch my breath. I've got the occupational disease of oversized ex-athletes.

No trouble at all.  Hawkeye.

Same here.

Ayuh.

Maria...

It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.

I'd be crazy to think my virtue, such as it is, was more important than his life...

There's only one worth noticing.

That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?

You don't have any problem. You've got thirty good years ahead of you, easy. Maybe you'll have to cut down as you grow older, get along with just two fiancees, but...

Just about enough to say goodbye to everybody.  Line up over here, men, if you want to pay your last respects. Keep moving and file on out when you're through.

That. It's out of the act.

I  wouldn't  wish  it  on  a  maneating  shark.

You got to relax, Henry. Since the deluge started, you been working in the OR and running the outfit, too.

I don't know. I must have lost my punch. I didn't think the son-of-a- bitch would get up.

Yes, sir, I'll see if I can reach General Hammond in Seoul for you. You think he'll finally break down and give us two more surgeons?

Stop that, O'Rielly!

Oh, get out of here!

Morning, Radar. How were things?

Morning, Captain.

They can't do that to me!

The address of the N.E.P.H. and W. Why don't you meet me there when you're through golf for drinks and dinner and whatever strikes the fancy?

Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!

Yeah. Lavender and old lace!

Yeah, maybe.

Against what?

Why can't you call right, you bone- headed, pig-eared, lop-eared, pot- bellied

No.

Never mind. Let him alone. He's all right. I'll be right over there pulling for you.

Hello.

I don't know. About three hundred thousand.

Oh, I'm sure I can.

And, Miss MitchellI think from now on you'd better work directly with me.

All right, but present it to him as a great cause for the common man.

No, no, nothat's your seat.

Well, don't say anything at all. Just sit down.

No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.

Oh, yes you will, Ann dear . . . you're very clever.

You remember those lovely people your father used to take care of? I thought I'd buy them some groceries. Oh, Ann, dear, it's a shame, those poor

You bet I will, Ma.

Look, Mr. Connell . . . I just can't afford to be without work right now, not even for a day. I've got a mother and two kid sisters to . . .

What's that?

What letter?

Uh-huh. You said you wanted fireworks.

A deal?

Holy smokes! Wasting my time listening to this mad woman.

That's all, Ned. Thank you.

Sorry.

No, no, no! You can't take pictures of him like thateating a sandwichand with a beard!

No, no, no. Now that's too much!

Thank you.

That's

I used to pitch.

What?

And let me tell you, Long John. When you become a guy with a bank account, they got you.  Yes sir, they got you!

The heelots!

I don't know how you're gonna stand it around here till after Christmas.

Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, honey.

Yeah. That'sthat's him. Of course, you don't know Grubbel, but he's the man that everybody figured was the worst no-account in the neighborhood because he was living like a hermit and nobody'd have anything to do with him. Er, that is until Murphy, the postman told us the truth. "Why, Grubbel," he says, "he lives out of garbage cans because he won't take charity. Because it'd ruin his self-respect," he says.

A gag. A gag!

Yeah? Well, you can have it!

Sure, sure. I'd like to believe in fairy tales, but a guy that's fake isn't gonna jump off any roof.

Sure. I remember . . . Say, did your ears pop coming up in the elevator? Mine did.

Stop worrying, Colonel. I'm gonna get my arm fixed out of this.

Five thousand bucks!  I had it right in my hand!

Hiyah, John.  John, I want to have a little talk with you.  What's the matterare you falling? Come here.

Uh-huh. That's exactly what I thought. Beany, go on down to the office, tell Pop to give you the speech. There's a copy on my desk.

You betcha.

Sure. I don't blame you. So am I.

That's right. You got it! Sure! He came in here and I made him change his mind. "Bulletin editor saves John Doe's life." Why, it's perfect. I'll have Ned write it up.  Oh, Ned!

Say, let's get something straight here. I don't want any part of this thing. If you've got an idea I'm going around lecturing to people, why you're crazy! Baseball's my racket, and I'm sticking to it. Come on, Colonel, let's get out of here.

No you won't! You're through deciding anything!

Let go of me!  This man had no intention of jumping off of the top of a building! He was paid to say so!  Do you deny that?

And what about the suicide note? You didn't write that, either!

There! You see? He admits it! You're a fake, John Doe! And for what you've done to all these good peoplethey ought to run you out of the countryand I hope they do it!

No, she just left. I'm surprised you didn't run into her. She went over to Mr. Norton's house.

Good night, John.

Uh-huh.

Nineteen!

What?

He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence.

Fuck him. He swings at anything in the dirt. I could strike him out.

Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job.

Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.

It's not just the particles man, it's the whole fucking machine, this is how they get assassins to operate. It's been this way since the cuban missile crisis.

You want a convertible or hardtop?

Is there a problem?

...a car.

...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...

You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay.

Open the bag, dump everything on the table.

If you say so.

A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow.

National Marksman Competition.

Furthest point I could find from New York.

Around. Barnett's tough competition.

I'm not good at lying.

Why?

I have two words for you... Seek help.

Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?

He'll be running at the quarter pole.

The jockey!

About six years. My partner took me.

Occasionally you lose.

Police corruption. It's everywhere.

I don't know, but I've got to get on there.

I thought I could do it. I was so damn sure of myself. But I didn't know what to say. The words wouldn't come. My mouth turned to mush. You make it look so easy, Roper. But it is not. It's not easy.  It's a different job than looking through the rifle scope.

You've got to decide that for yourself.

Good question.

Only that floor.

You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.

She's the one to blame. Not me.

And why the fuck would you do that for me?

Veronica, it's not easy for me... I don't know if I can change overnight. But what I'm telling you is that I want to share everything with you, because I don't ever want to be without you again.

He was going nuts at the park. He met this very attractive poodle. They made plans to meet again next weekend.

In Europe women find older men very sexy.

Hmm?

I'm talking about... What are you talking about?

I'm en route. E.T.A. in five.

Depends. What's up?

Define concern.

Your concern is heartwarming.

Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?

Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.

He said he was just going up to talk to him. He said...  I want to be put on this case.

Halden, how nice to hear your voice.

I have found in life that what one wants isn't nearly as important as what one needs.

-- Two million people lost in the digital night.  What do they seek?

-- Because there'll be no remorse. Not in my world.

If you could meet God, what would you say to him?

About what?

That's the grace of this world.  Nothing's impossible.

Nothing, go back to sleep.

Wake up?!

True.  But why?

Not my problem.

In here I am.

It's not real.

New York.

Sorry, I just design the maze.  Keeping the keys secure is your job.

-- Yes.

He's not plugged-into the system. He's in the fucking system!

The Terrace.  First building Christoph ever programmed for us.

That's right.

Katie was digitized.

If she's alive, you get it back.

No.

-- The inside?

Yes.

Look, I'm doing mute 'till I have a mouthpiece here who's on my side.

Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.

There?

Speed?

They're called squirbs.

The only way to obtain the power is to achieve the highest state of being...

Ah... sure.

Stylin'!

There should be a way to open it.

... Let's take a look over there.

What does that mean?!

The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED!  You must return it to the depths. or  anyone should open it and Ivan is released!

Don't lose hope yet, Alpha!

I think so.

THERE'S THE COMET!

There's enough for everybody!

If we told you -- we'd have to kill you.

Look closer.

How dare you?!  Nobody shuts up Rita but me!

What's going on?!

Strength in numbers!!

And I am the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky!

When the people get so upset, our politician friends gotta listen.

Awwh, Charlie.

Poor, yeah.

Tell me something, Meyer. How can you get up at dawn to walk on the beach if you're on your honeymoon?

Hey, I ignore my wife too. But on our honeymoon I paid attention.

You scare me, Charlie.

So what happened?

I guess I am. Just a little.

Scared.

An intelligent plan, Mr. Luciano, but listen to me well. It can be ruined in a single careless moment. Keep your feet on the ground and your high opinion of yourself under your hat.

Can't we get a couple whores over?

He's hidin'. Word's out Tommy Reina's goin' over ta Maranzano.

Long as Charlie says.

Sure, Frankie. Fuck me. Fuck Meyer. Fuck Arnold Rothstein who's made us all rich. All so you can be an fuckin' honorary Sicilian!

Ya mean we're so rich we're broke?

Mr. Costello handles our business with the government agencies.

Why? You're the innocent one.

I'm very sorry... I didn't...

It always is.

And maybe that's why he ended up dead in the streets of Rome.

So we end up with everybody but the two Bosses, at our meet. We ain't sayin' we're the leaders, but we're leadin'.

What's with the banquet? This is supposed to be a private meet.

Never threaten me, Boss.

So he can talk to all the families behind your back? Maybe have his own meet at 3:00 AM under the goddamn boardwalk? No. You're too smart for a sucker play.

Didn't know you felt that way.

I'm still the Boss of All the Bosses! And you'll do what I say!

They're friends of our enemy.

But that's an hour's drive.

You can't kill me. You gave your word, Charlie.

I must know more of you, my son.

The name's Charlie.

He's the Boss of all the Bosses, and I respect him.

I don't fuck my partners.

What makes you think I give a damn about that Sicilian crap?

You disrespect our tradition.

Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?

Jesus.

Yeah. But he needs me alive.

Open a window. Every newsboy in town's screamin' about it.

Just wanted ta say hello.

Julie, that stuff probably saved his life.

Animals? What <u>kind</u> of animals?

Yo, Jumbo. We got us some kind of <u>ventriloquist</u> here.

I dress up when I want to make an impression. - So how'd it go?

Can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances?

Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that piñata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.

Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?

Do you know what kind of opportunity you have here? You gotta <u>strike</u>. I'm talking mansions. Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth!

He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop. <i></i> Anybody here know what Oneirix is?

What'll it do if they pull the plug?

Well, I have to get a message to her. I have to let her know I'm <u>okay</u>. Until I can get out of here...

Farewell? You mean - you mean I'm -

Actually, Stu, Julie doesn't get to decide. That's why she was having the nightmare. <i></i> They're pulling the plug at nine AM.

Maybe you could talk to Death!

But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??

Monkeybone...!?

Home sweet home, huh? Actually, I was expecting something a little swankier. How much loot does old Stu rake in, anyway?

You're acting kind of...odd.

I had to park two blocks away. Is something -

Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.

He called me "Doc."

Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.

When'd you get in?

Please, Julie. This is not easy for me. Our father took a <u>long</u> time to die. A long time. It just about killed us all. And Stu and I made a pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let it drag out.

This is hard for me, Julie...very hard...but it's been three months now, and... <i></i> I gave the order.

Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th--

Sorry. The women here aren't my type. Most of them aren't even my <u>species</u>.

Sorry, Kitty! I'll be right back after I choke my monkey.

Oh, <u>sure</u>. Mr. Action Hero! Why couldn't I be Arnold Schwarzenegger's figment?

I don't <u>know</u>.

Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine.

I'm good.

What pictures?

Oh, it's so nice to meet you.

Oh, I hope so, dear.

I'm sorry.

Dear, I was thinking.  Why don't we go to Paris next year?  I've never been.  Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling.

Oh.  I thought today was Saturday.

Men ... they're all the same.  Our pastor in Sioux Falls was caught with his wife's sister.

Oh, it was such a big scandal.

So, you come here all by yourself?

Yeah.

Thirty is base price.  Tolls, tax, tip ... it all adds up.

Uh-huh. And where's the Press Galery?

I did not--

Never.

What for? Why, suppose there's a storm--all lines are down--how you gonna get a message to Ma?

Well, because you're doing all right at the minute.

You know--Mrs. Diz Moore.

Get my *whole* fall outfit--and quit this job in style!

Oh, you mean--Puss in Boots.

What do I play?

Paine.

Yeah.

Tunnel?

What?

Okay--I mean--

Right now--everything I own--!

I've told you ten times--if I had anything they couldn't bat down in a second, don't you suppose I'd've been up in that hearing yelling murder! Sure--he was cooked the night I sounded off like a fool and spilled the whole works!

He's a house-afire!

Kid--he thinks he's talking to that mob at home, but not a line we've written--not a word he's said from that floor has gotten into that home State.

I'll bear that in mind... What? Oh. Dinner. Pet--my stomach couldn't hold a bird seed.

Nonsense.

Yup--Sweeney, Flood, Farrell--waiting for you--

How do you feel, champ?

Relax, Happy. Jim said to wait.

*You* tell Jim Taylor.

Jim--if I fling a party man like Horace in the face of those angry committees--

Oh, now, I'm afraid that's been exaggerated some--

Uh--Jefferson Smith's residence?

Excellent! Excellent! My boy, I'm convinced our State has a great debt of gratitude to you--

Well, it sort of got to be--from Jeff just pullin' splinters and things--

Taylor! May I ask what *Taylor* has to do with it?

To--to a reception--uh--for a princess-- I forget her name--

I am about to ask for a roll call on the passage of the Resolution--without further delay. The Senator can have nothing to say at this time that would not be either in bad grace or--

"Boy Stuff." Why, printer's ink runs in your veins, Jeff. You're just like your father.

No.

The *Bills*? Jeff--let me advise you-- as your father would--politics is a business--sometimes a cruel business. In your time here, you couldn't even start on those Bills. They're put together by legal minds--after a long study. Why, after twenty years, I can't understand half of them myself. No, really, Jeff--in your own interests--

Jeff! You're trying to understand in a moment everything about a project that took two years to set up--the reasons--the benefits--

Will he yield for a question?

Every *aspect* of this matter--the gentleman's attack on that section-- everything--was dealt with in the committee hearing--

Mr. President--

Yes, so I was told, Mr. Taylor, but--

What is your interest in this, Mr. Taylor?

Office of--Senator Smith?

Yes, I'm Saunders--and this is Mr. Moore--a member of the press. Meet the *Senator*, Mr. Moore.

Well--he's got nothing on me.

You *couldn't*?

Yes. Sure. It was his idea. *I* should have been the one to think of it--

I know--but you--you're going to help.

Tonight.

Some committee's got it.

Yes. Sure. What's a Steering Committee?

*This* is.

Thanks very much.

Yes, Senator--*twice*.

I want to make that come to life-- yes, and lighted up like that, too-- for every boy in the land. Boys forget what their country means--just reading "land of the free" in history books. And they get to be men--and forget even more. Liberty is too precious to get buried in books, Miss Saunders. Men ought to hold it up in front of them--every day of their lives and say: "I am free--to think--to speak. My ancestors couldn't. I can. My children will."

Baltimore. Pure city-dweller.

No, they couldn't. Father was a doctor. The kind who placed ethics above collections. That speaks well for Father but it always left us kind of--  Could we get on with this, Senator?

I also answer to whistles.

Look--I think we ought to skip it.

In Terry Canyon?

One of the plagues on members of Congress--office-seekers, cranks, people with pet bills. Get my son into West Point--or *outta* West Point. I've got a scheme to put people to work. How do I get rid of cockroaches? Some woman's composed a hymn to replace the Star Spangled Banner. Want to hear it?

Wow!

I--I don't know. I--I'm afraid they've got me licked.

Yeah. I guess--sometimes--Senator Paine must be right. Sometimes you-- you got to compromise a little--  And if you say so too, Saunders--if *you* think that's the thing to do--

You see--if we could take the poor kids off the streets--out of cities-- a few months in the summer--learn something about Nature and American ideals--

The truth! Well, the man wants the truth! "What *is* truth?" asked so-and-so, and turned away!

Goodnight, Senator--

I'm splendid, too.

And how's your bill, Senator?

Well! You don't say!

The Senator will please suspend until order is restored in the chamber.

Oh--you're *sure* of that now?

Yes, *sir*.  Let's *go* Henry.

Oh--nothing--nothing. My idea is-- for the Government to lend us the money--and the boys'll pay it back-- sending in a penny or a nickel--no more than a dime--no, gosh--the Government's got enough on its hands without--

How'd you like a punch in the nose?

That's what he's been doing since last heard from.

Jeff--meet Mr. Cook and Mr. Griffith-- members of our State headquarters here.

I've got 'im, Joe. Be right along.

Joe--I'm getting leery of this guy. We keep calling him dumb--and he keeps winding up in our hair! I'm telling you--when he finds out there's a dam going up where he wants his camp, he's gonna start asking questions six ways from Sunday--

Well, then--this is too much for *my* lame brain. I'm calling Jim Taylor.

Joe--listen--all Susan has to do is turn those big eyes on him--he'll fall all over himself--just keep him out of there *one afternoon*--while they read that bill--

Saunders! I'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the Brooklyn Bridge--

Well, well!

You're more than that. I've had example of the fact that wild horses couldn't pull confidential matter in these two offices out of you. That's why I tell you what I do--about Smith and this situation. So, you see--

You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.

Saunders--it's going to go pretty bad for Jeff tomorrow. There's only one thing that can be done for him now--  I--I've written his resignation. He resigns under protest--denying all charges. No one will ever be sure if he was guilty or not. It leaves him with at least a shred of honor. The other way--branded openly in the Senate--expelled--he'll never live it down. Rather a simple compromise than utter ruin. In a year--the whole thing might be forgotten--

I thought I could, too.  *My* business--this fine future! I have no future I *care* about, if this boy is broken! I--I can't sleep. The only important thing in my life now is to save what I can for him. I want him to get a start again--I'll see that he's taken care of as long as he lives--!  Saunders--whether you ever mean anything to him or not--

--in other words, Jim--with this Willet Creek Dam on the fire--the man who goes to the Senate now in Sam Foley's place can't ask any questions or talk out of turn. We must be absolutely sure of him.

Jim--if what you say about the future is remotely possible--why not do as I say--drop things like this dam?

Joe--do you mean to say--do you think you can actually *handle* this--this whatever-you-call-it in Washington?

Chick--turn the ballyhoo boys loose on this right away. Greatest appointment ever made. A banquet-- declare a holiday.

Wait a minute--Jim--you didn't ask *Smith* over here!

I don't want any part of crucifying this boy.

Will Senator Smith yield to--?

Order!  Will Senator Smith yield to--?

Will Senator Smith yield to his colleague?

Oh, yes - Deeds. Fine fellow. Very democratic. You won't have no trouble at all. Talk to anybody.

Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.

Oh, yes - he's pixilated all right.

He sure is.

Yes, sir.

No, no children.

I haven't.

Would you like to go for a walk?

Your Honor!

No!

Yes!

They're colored! Just to make him look silly!

Yes!!!

Look, this is my house. I'd like to

No. That is, I didn't  Until I met you. I like talking to you, though  Imagine my finding you right on my doorstep.

Really?

Oh. What's happening about the opera?

Yes.

It's wonderful.

That depends on what they see.

Yeah, I guess so. What puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other. Why don't they try liking each other once in a while?

Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.

He did? I play the tuba

He did?

No - not at all. I couldn't sleep either.

Oh, I wouldn't let them stop me from seeing you. So I threw them out!

A girl?

Yes, here we are again.  Good night.

Yes, of course.

Why? Why do we have to do it?

Yeah, then what?

I just couldn't stand seeing him again.

What's gotten into you, Babe? I remember the time when you'd blast this town wide open before you'd let Cobb get away with a thing like this.

With pay!

Uh-huh.

Yes.

Yeah. Funny twist, isn't it?

I'm going to tell him the truth.

Aw, listen Babe, I can't let you quit now. You're not going through with this thing, are you?

Come on - let's go!

Oh, yes sir.

I wanna see that guy!

They say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money.

But your honor

Wants to know who the heir is.

Are you sure this is the town he lives in?

Yeah?

Okay.

Why, no.

Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?

Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?

How can he make any trouble for me? I haven't done anything.

That's very kind of you. Are you related to him?

Why should you?

Uh-huh.

What're you talking about?

Oh.

He's the shipping clerk at the Tallow Works. Wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit.

Will you tell the gentleman I'm not in?

What? There must be 2000 of them out there.

We own an opera house, don't we?

Me?!

You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.

Because it just isn't a business, that's all!

Ja.

Well, thanks, I - uh  How do you do? What is your name?

What about it, Mr. Deeds?

Huh?

Oh. That.

You mean to tell me you don't carry a pocketful around with you?

Fun?  Say, listen, I'll take you on a bender that will live in your memory as a thing of beauty and joy forever.  Boy! Boy! My headpiece!

South Dakota north.

Huh? Oh, yes - yes, of course. Her sister. Yes, I've been her sister for a long time.

Yes, sir.

Every man to his taste, sir.

I just wanted to make sure.

Prairie? Oysters?

Better bring me some coffee, Walter.

Who?

What do you mean by coming in here when I'm playing?

Yeah.

I'm not sure. But I think they're worried about you.

Really? You think so?

Uh-huh. What are they?

What happened?

A friend?

...And I from Phyllis.

It could happen. What about his state certification exams? The records seem to be in order.

Dorothy Fowler. Fantastic woman. She passed last year in a train wreck. Damned Amtrak.

What kind of doubts?

Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you?

Not for this. Not me, you're not.

It doesn't matter how I feel about it. It's how you feel about it that matters.

You are so mean.

What exactly is it supposed to do?

-- Which I don't necessarily agree.

My name's Gilroy. I'm from the State Certification Board.

Mr. Gilroy --

A little.

I'm sorry, your honor.

Oh?

I'd better get in there.

Man, you see him a lot. And it's very wrong to reveal it. Next you'll be saying what his problem is.

Oh, I don't know...

Doc.  Ainge...

And it's the Hubble Telescope, not the Himball Telescope.

You've got to have the right ladder for the job. You don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble.

Thanks for your help, Lionel.

Sure.

That would explain it.

I'm trying.

Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself completely in his hands. For today, anyway.

Mother... go away!

Good evening, Mrs. Cook.

Well, I gotta say, Mrs. Cook, you're right about that.

Oh, lord. It's almost too exhausting to tell you...  ...about my exhaustion. I didn't really want to come. I'm not hopeful right now. But I couldn't take the look on my dad's face. He's a truly kind person, which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story. He's the opposite of me, I guess -- all stamina and resolve.

Hmm, as in -- that's interesting. Sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out.

Something's bothering her.

Uh-huh.

Is that like a party trick?

You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?

Oh, there's something wrong with you, all right. Especially after hearing that dream of yours, about the Roto-Rooter.

No, that'd be a good story, but that was just the beginning of the end. We went on for another year or so.

Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. Lives next door.

Then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning.

Therapy? Hell no, I just don't want to do it alone.

Of course.

Transference.

What?

I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.

It's a big part of the show.

Uh-huh.

No again?

How are you?

You are Panda, monarch of modems.

Jerking off?

Really?

Just you.

Are you telling me your last job before becoming a psychologist was --

Holy shit!

Hey, you've done good. Look at yourself... you've cleaned up, you've got a career --

Who'd you go with?  That's not good.

You know how easy it is. A kid can manage it if he wants a fake I.D. You can do practically the whole deal at your local Kinko's. The only variable is how much pride you take in the product.

I understand what it's like to want to leave a problem behind. That's all most people are looking to do.  Mainly, I listen.

Really?

Lily...  ...Skip, that's great! You and Lily.

What?

Yep.

I suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area?

They are evil, cursed, they matter not.

By reading the Book Of The Dead.

Exactly! I speak seven languages, including Hebrew, so my specialty was synagogues. How about you? Kill somebody?

None of the above, thank you.

Why if it ain't my little buddy, Beni. I oughta kill you.

I've had worse.

It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune.

It is because it was you who read from the Book. He has chosen you to be the human sacrifice needed to regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun.

-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.

And burn the map and retrieve the key.

You will not believe it.

-- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it.

I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.

He said... he was just looking for a good time.

Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent.

What did you find? What did you see?

The last time I was at that place everybody I was with died.

Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to the underworld", actually.

And the fact that they say it's made out of pure gold, makes no nevermind to you, right?

The things that get you excited.

I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this?

Because that's my name.

Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had.

You dream about dead guys?

Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone.

Look lady, I appreciate you saving my life and all, but when I signed on, I agreed to take you out there and bring you back, and I did, now were even, end of job, end of story, contract terminated.

You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot.

The creature!? Are you sure!?

Jealous? You kiddin' me? Did you see that guy's face?

Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep them.

Yes?

That just makes you more gullible.

Picked his pocket, actually.

Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.

What's it look like!?

Be nice. That thing saved my life.

Rat gizzards. They smell bad and taste worse, but that's the best the desert has to offer.

And now he's going to use it to bring his girlfriend back

I'm with you, old man. No one touches my sister like that and gets away with it.

He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.

Really?

Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet.

So who killed him?

My father had this friend... He was an inventor...

The Inscrutable Six?

Let's do it.

You're nuts.

Just a waitress.

Really?

Why not?

I get off work in fifteen minutes. Walk me home?

Why?

I wouldn't mind being famous.

It's home.

What have they got that we ain't got?

And what if you get killed?

I just know.

The wise snake coils before he strikes.

And smell a little funny. We're not bulletproof and we can't fly. But we're superheroes -- and that means doing what's right -- even when it's impossible... This is our city -- these are our friends, our families -- and if we don't save them, nobody will! So I say we take a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, destroy that Psycho-whatchamabob -- and teach those deviants a lesson they'll never forget!

He is in love. His anger is gone.

What have the famous superheroes got that we don't?

Yeah.

The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard. But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.

No one's sure that he actually exists, but they say he can be contacted by leaving a message on a crumpled up napkin at the Tacky Taco down by the bus station.

Oh shut up.

Normal. What's normal? Does normal exist? And if it did, how would we know it?

Burgers all around.  Medium.  Rare.  Raw.

We take the licks and he gets the chicks.

Or both.

Crime was rampant. It wasn't safe to stay in your home.

Great timing!

But, Your Majesty, the very substance of the Tilsit treaty was that you should join the Continental Blockade, boycott English goods, suspend all commercial dealings with her, and be France's ally.  Nothing more is being asked than to comply with the treaty.

I can appreciate what Your Majesty is saying but the Emperor has staked everything on this policy.  He has no other way to attack England, and no one knows more than Your Majesty how his overtures for peace have been rejected.

Very well, General, what is it you wish to say?

General Kutusov, feel free to say whatever you like.

For the sake of your argument, let us say that is correct.

General Kutusov, I would like to call a meeting of my cabinet tomorrow morning and have you present this idea to them.  I think it has merit and is worthy of consideration.

I think it's absolutely charming.

May I come to the map?

What forces do you have at your disposal?

You could have them here by daybreak.

The numbers are not particularly relevant.  You are not up against soldiers -- this is a mob, and they will run as soon as things become sufficiently unpleasant.

Fair enough.

They are at the gates of Paris, sire.

It is on this road, sire, following me.

I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician.

Yes, sir, I am.

No, sir, none at all.

Thank you, sir.  I will do that.

Yes, I am.

Oh -- where do you come from?

Ah, good evening, my dear Duroc. I'm afraid I've been out hunting and I have had a rather bad fall.

What is that?

This morning, a Lieutenant and three soldiers came to our house and asked if we had weapons.  I explained we had only my late father's sword, which, in fact, was not a weapon but only a keepsake of memory.

No, sir.

My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have.

I fear our meeting is long overdue... Napoleon.

Yes -- an excellent idea.

I very much doubt that he will.

My dear Francis, you do seem extremely uncomfortable.

Would you like some brandy?

Francis, may I ask whether you wear warm winter underwear?

Ah, well, that is the first rule of warfare.  You must wear long-sleeved and long-legged underwear.  You can never conjure up brilliancies with a cold bottom.

Good evening, Mademoiselle.

Well, one must do something to live, you know -- and I have an elderly mother who depends on me.

Do you have three francs, sir?

To Citizen General Bonaparte from one who does not wish to see him dishonored by his wife.  You should know, Citizen General, that your wife has taken a lover, one Captain Hippolyte Charles... undated and unsigned.

No...

And you, Junot?

You know I am only too happy to be of help to you, but surely this isn't the ideal moment to involve yourself in such matters.

Are you trying to insult me?

No, I'm afraid I never had the pleasure of meeting the General. This sword was taken several days ago from your son by some of my soldiers.

No.

One had better legs.

Not in the least.  After all, what is adultery -- only a brief transaction on a couch, requiring a few minutes of privacy.

Open the door.  It's me.

What are you doing in there?

Five minutes.

Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?

I thought he would be seeing you before I would, and would give it to you.

That's all you can say?  What are you talking about?

I wrote it.

God help me -- yes.

Yes?

I questioned the maid, and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months.

No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.

Oh, then you are...

You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise.

I only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest.

We have a treaty with Austria.

That is a matter of opinion.

He will stand by his agreement -- I know him better than you do.

Monsieur Varlac, I will count slowly to five, and if you have not begun to get down from the cart by then, I will carry out your execution, on the spot.

Yes, sir.

Life is a burden for me.  Nothing gives me any pleasure; I find only sadness in everything around me.  It is very difficult because the ways of those with whom I live, and probably always shall live, are as different from mine as moonlight is from sunlight.

Duroc, I have a bill here for 600,000 francs from Tirot, for building the Imperial throne and six decorated arm-chairs.  The amount is absurd -- and, at least twice too much.

A year ago, the whole of Europe was marching alongside of us.  Today, the whole of Europe is marching against us.

That's it?

Naw, it ain't like that.

Yup.

Thank you.  I only got two bullets in the mothafucka, but it's better than nothing.

Black magic.

Cheeco.

If you say another word, it's over.  I'm not playing!

I know, we had a good time.  But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch.

Naw, them dudes is assholes.  Especially that dog - Cheeco.  Watch this little ass, he's sneaky.  Plus, I got something better than a Cadillac.

Man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying off my daddy's bad credit, we didn't end up with a million.  We bought this house and I spent the rest on this.  It's the bomb, huh?

Man, it's a long story.  I met D'Wana three months ago.  She had a little pudge in her stomach but I didn't pay it no attention.  Come to find out, she six months pregnant.  Saying I'm the daddy!

What you mean, so?

Damn...how much money ya'll got left from the lottery?

Oh yeah, why you walking?

So what?  Let's make'em wait.

Okay.

Nice house. Didn't expect you to answer. You must be one of those entertainers. What team you play for?

No, I'mma go on to work.  I don't wanna hear Elroy's mouth.  Now listen to me, Craig.  It's gonna be different living over here.  Don't let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit.  Understand?

I saw it.

Come on.

Strange activity.  I think they running drugs off Tijuana.  Day-Day don't believe me.

Nice to meet you?

What up, bro?

You damn right that's the big one.

Negative...they vamped.

Bummer, huh?  And Friday is suppose to be a kick-ass day.

R-U-S-H Intensely.

Ya'll live around here?

Bite his ear!

I got fired too.

Nothing.

Man, we can't ride to Rancho Cucamonga on that.

What urgent message?

Hey!  I said I'll take your fuckin' ass later.  Now get out of here.  You're scaring our company.

Take your car.

I don't know.  Suga, go ask Miss Ho Kym if she seen them.

Mr. Nasty time.  But take it easy on me, girl.

The Bonaventure. The Bonaventure Hotel. Do you know where that is?

Same to you.

You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?

I'd like to know what...

Yes, you will, Mr. Watson.

Tell me why he's dead.

Do you now, Mr. Watson?

Don't you threaten me.

Well, you can trust Eleanor Samara Grant.

I can hear you good. Can you hear me?

I'm tired. I want to.go now.

All right.

No...kisses to you.

I remember. The big tipper.

Hey, a big tip doesn't give you the right to crap in my ear. You want change?  You got it, brother. What was that you gave me, a twenty?

What?

I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.

No, I didn't. I confiscated it. There's a difference.

Laughs.

Shut up.

Nah.  Hates his wife.

Keep your eyes peeled.

Come with me, honey.

I kill her anyway.

'Daddy has to go now.

How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher?

You, Preacher?

Dad, you're bleeding...

When'll Dad's skiff be ready?

Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.

If you got an appetite for bones and bitterness.

Don't!

It's more fun hearin' stories in the dark.

Yes! Yes! Hallelujah!

Mr. Powell!  Willa has run away!

She took out some time durin' the night, -- in that old Model-T --

All to pieces!

You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!

Icey, I don't want a husband.

John don't like him much.

You ain't leavin' in no hurry if we can help it!

She lieth in wait as for a prey. And increaseth the transgressors among men.

Mister Powell!

'Night Miss Jenny; don't let the bedbugs bite.

Hm?

Pearl! Oh, Pearl!

Why?

Yes. Yes.

NO, -- it ain't fair to make Pearl tell when she swore she wouldn't. I'll tell.

Under the stone in the floor.

Tell me another secret about my Dad.

Will you buy me a choclit sody?

No. No one never did.

A strange woman is a narrow pit!

Yes; from the first night.

Our honeymoon.

She'll not be back. I reckon I'd be safe in promisin' you that.

He don't mean no impudence; do you, boy?  Do you, boy? Ah, many's the time poor Brother Ben told me about these youngins.

How'do.

Pearl and John.

Look, I know it's been frightening, I know your dreams have seemed real. But... it's okay. Okay?

It's just made her think... her dreams are real...

Glen. Not now. I mean, we're here for Tina now, not for ourselves.

Because he was scary, that's why.

Oh -- jeez -- Glen! Rod's gone ape!

Yeah.

They turn their back on it.  Takes away its energy, and it disappears.

Hi.

If I can't, then you all can relax, because it'll just be a simple case of me being nuts.

Meanwhile whatever you do don't fall asleep. Midnight.

Okay. Hi, dad.

Just want to talk to him a second.

You don't know he did it.

Sure, sure, honey. You just do that -- get yourself some sleep -- that's what I've been saying all along.

Oh, Jesus -- Nancy!  Hey! We got a fire!

Something like a razor was the weapon, but nothing found on the scene.

Uh, she just saw you, sir...

Right home after. See you.

You're not falling asleep, are you? You could drown, you know.

It happens all the time.  I've got some warm milk all ready for you. Why don't you jump into bed?  I'm gonna turn on your electric blanket, too. C'mon, now. 

Yes, Mother. G'night.

Right.

I threw that filthy thing away -- I don't know what you're trying to prove with it, but --

But that's just not reality, Nancy!

Dead and gone.

Go on...

How the fuck do I know?  I don't expect you to believe me.

I mean, it was as if there were four razors cutting her at the same time. But invisible razors. She just... opened up...

No.

He's nuts about you.

No more fights.

Too bad... you missed an inspiring day, Anna.

A few friends... just a little dinner party.

You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?

Possibly.

Positively not!

That's right.

I can tell you exactly.

If you asked him why he left France I bet he couldn't name one good reason.

Where is your courage, Comrade Buljanoff?

We'll just say we had to take it on account of the safe. That's a perfect excuse. There was no other safe big enough.

They accumulate millions by taking loss after loss.

And they might believe her in Moscow.

I think I need my glasses.

I must be stern with you.

I don't know how I can get you out of it this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?

The Duchess...

Well, gentlemen, how about my proposition?

Oh, yes, yes.

Well, if your mother turns against you, you have to look for someone to adopt you.

Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.

If you will forgive me, ever since you met that Bolshevik lady I've noticed a distinct change in you, sir.

May I add, sir, that it was with great amazement that I found a copy of Karl Marx's Capital on your night table. That is a socialistic volume which I refuse to so much as dust, sir. I view with alarm, sir, the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady.

No, sir.

Good evening, Louis. You seem to be very crowded tonight. Can you manage a table near the floor?

Oh, Leon, you are so good.

...so it blows up that big... what they call an Omelette Surprise!

Ninotchka, we are in the magic East, the country of Aladdin and His Lamp...

...it is in the air... it may come around the corner as you walk down the street....

Get out of here!

Look for yourselves.

Buljanoff, she still has those old- fashioned Bolshevik ideas.

Just looking around.

I will not repeat your mistake. I will have no dealings with the Grand Duchess nor her representative.

The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.

That kind of propaganda is bad anywhere, but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike.... Well, if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous.

The Grand Duchess Swana... active in the White Russian movement?

I think so too.

Me?

Correct me if I am wrong... We are facing north, aren't we?

How long does it take a man to land?

I don't have to but I find it natural.

I'll try.

Madame, it is that kind of approach which has made Paris what it is.

Go ahead.

You must admit that this doomed old civilization sparkles... It glitters!

It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.

He takes good care of that.

We take off our hat and coat.  We sit down -- we make ourselves comfortable. We adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening. We look at each other. We smile.  Well... we don't smile. How about some music?

Not too big and not too small. What I'd call the typical room of an average man. Or shall we say a little above average. Now if there are any special aspects you wish to study I have nothing to conceal. Just look around. That's my desk. Those are my books, and here am I. Where shall we begin?

I begin to believe in it myself since I've met you. I still don't know what to make of it. It confuses me, it frightens me a little, but it fascinates me, Ninotchka.

Thank you.

You're the most improbable creature I've ever met in my life, Ninotchka, Ninotchka...

I'd like to say it a thousand times.

That's the way a clock works. There's nothing wonderful about it. You merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration.

Oh, my barbaric Ninotchka. My impossible, unromantic, statistical...

Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...

I have a better suggestion. Let's forget that the telephone ever rang. I never heard that you are Yakushova... you are Ninotchka... my Ninotchka...

Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.

But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.

At what?

Then you should go back to your table.

Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one.

I don't think so.

No.

Yes.

A wonderful idea! Radio or records?

Leon, I want to tell you something which I thought I never would say, which I thought nobody ever should say, because I thought it didn't exist... and, Leon... I can't say it...

There have been cases... but the headache the next morning is worth while -- if you drink it with the right toast.  To us, Ninotchka!

And General Savitzky.

No, darling. I'll tell you another story, a much better one.  The only thing that will be over on Thursday is the lawsuit. There will be no Thursday for us. Not next week or any week. We won't let it happen. I'll tear it out of the calendar. Is that a good story?

Yes... a kiss... salute!

Let's turn on the radio.

But I can throw it out of the window.

It is their wish.

Darling, I was busy looking out for your interests.

We can forget horse racing, roulette, the stock market... our worries are over! You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to me.

You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots.

Now listen, Swana... I sold Monsieur Guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne. "The Life and Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia"!

Yes, I'm your little Volga boatman.

What does he say?

Didn't I tell you Benson and Benson were the tailors for you?

It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?

I'm the one who should apologize. I should have talked to you before.

This time, Swana -- just this once -- I must ask you to listen.

I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle?

What is this, Swana?

Do you expect me to believe that?

Dear me... I must be losing my finesse. If I'm not careful I'll be understood by everybody.

Exactly. You see, it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low-cut gowns in the old Russia. The lashes of the Cossacks across our backs were not very becoming, and you know how vain women are.

Please come to the point. What is it you want?

I must insist that you leave.

Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian.  I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police...

Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?

Won't those two years in court be expensive for you? I know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now...

Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months.

Yes.

I need very little sleep. We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange. I have already started a survey of our most urgent needs.

May I ask why?

No.

It gives details which couldn't be invented. Naturally I want to verify it and that's why I need you.

That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova.

Raw carrots and beets.

But, madame! If you don't think about food what do you think about?

Why do you bring this up after so many years?

Thank you so much, my friend. I will get in touch with you.

You did say it, sir.

But sir, we'll have to start over from the beginning.  We don't have the staff to ...

"Ex-CIA"?  There's no such thing as "ex-CIA," John -- they're all Ivy League Establishment.  Is he one of these guys with a beef against us?

What?

Either it goes to Mitchell or it comes here.

You say, John, cut our losses and all the rest.  But suppose the thing blows and they indict Bob and the others. Jesus, you'd never recover from that, John.  It's better to fight it out instead, and not let people testify ...

I'm one of his people.  The Cubans are his people.  And we're going to jail for him.

Yeah, I knew it.  I knew it from '69 on, and I said it all along, didn't I ...

How so?

Christ, we created Frankenstein with those fucking Cubans.

He left his White House phone number in his hotel room.

In hiding.  He sent Liddy to talk to me.

Pay him?  I told him to get out of the country.  It's crazy to start ...

Uh, we've never done this before, sir ... How do we pay?  In ... hundreds?  Do you fill a black bag full of unmarked bills?

The hard-core four million "Nixon nuts" aren't gonna go for it ... They'll say I sold out to the Communists.

Sir, Bob and I are gonna have to testify before Earvin's committee.

He's completely lost touch with reality.

I don't know anything about that.

I know it well, sir.

Definitely.  Colson had him trying to break into Bremer's apartment after Bremer shot Wallace, to plant McGovern campaign literature.

Yes, you approved it, sir.

We were working on China.

The bastard!  If I'd called his shot on Cuba I would've won.  He made me look soft.

Before?!  Eisenhower approved that?

No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious.  Why're we stopping?

Yeah, we've got to get our vice president off the golf course and back there on the college circuit.  That's top priority.

Wait till the Mai-tais wear off.

You're talking too much about black Africa, Henry.  It's killing us with the rednecks.

Right.  They don't trust!  They don't trust America!

... beating out the other papers, chasing girls ...

He'll be looking in his toilet bowl every time he pulls the chain.

It's Helms -- it's got to be.

Please, Mother, it ... it was just one time, Mother, I'm ... I'm sorry.

Thou must.

What ... ?

Harold ... can I get you anything?

My friends call me "Mister President."

Firing you, Mr. Helms, wouldn't do any good.  Of course you'll continue as DCI.  You're doing a magnificent job.

Yes.  And you will give General Cushman full access.

My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know.

Black Irishman.  Very moving. "Turning and turning in the widening gyre / The falcon cannot hear the falconer / Things fall apart, the center cannot hold / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world / And everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned / The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity" ... But it ends so beautifully ominous -- "What rough beast, its hours come round at last / Slouches toward Bethlehem to be born?" ... Yes, this country stands at such a juncture.

If things remain as they are ... He's got the anti-war vote.

It could be '60 all over again, Edgar. Bobby's got the magic, like a goddamn rock star.  They climb all over each other just to touch his clothes! He'll ride his brother's corpse right into the White House.

Don't listen to 'em, don't quit. Remember - Kennedy, Bobby, and King were against the war.  Where are they now?  Don't give 'em a goddamn inch on the war.  President Johnson bombed Laos for years and nobody knew or said a thing.  How the hell the Times ever got ahold of this Ellsberg stuff is a disgrace!

Injections.  Even this noble sport's been fixed.  Seen the guys?

We're gonna be plumbers, Frank.  We're gonna plug a leak.

Remember -- listen up!  Fire team discipline is there at all times. Keep your radios on at all times during the entire penetration.  Check yourselves.  Phony ID's, no wallets, no keys.  We rendezvous where?  The Watergate, Room 214.  When?  At zero three-hundred.

He's all business, ain't he, Trini?  Dick, we could've had our own goddamn lawyers handle this deal.  We brought you down here 'cause we wanted to talk to you ...

Agreed.

That sonofabitch Kennedy is coming back down here tomorrow.  Dick, we're willing to put up a shitpot fulla money to get rid of him -- more money'n you ever dreamed of.

It's nobody's fault, Jack.  It's change -- which is a fact of history. Even that old cocksucker Hoover's dead.  Things change.

What do you mean, Jack?

... and what do we get for it?  Gobs and gobs of bullshit, gossip, nothing! Someone is leaking. We've got to stop the leaks, Henry, at any cost, do you hear me?  Then we can go for the big play -- China, Russia.

I ... I heard something ... It sounded idiotic.

They will understand, sir.  To be undone by a third-rate burglary is a fate of biblical proportions.  History will treat you far more kindly than your contemporaries.

Do you ever pray?  You know ... believe in a Supreme Being?

How a fat man gets so many girls.

Why?

How did he do that?  All those kids ... Why do they hate me so much?

... but it's not, bottom-line, gonna change a goddamn thing, John.  The question is: How do we screw Ellsberg so bad it puts the fear of God into all leakers?

You remember, John, in '48 -- no one believed Alger Hiss was a communist. Except me.  They loved Hiss just like they loved this Ellsberg character. East Coast, Ivy League.  He was their kind.  I was dirt to them.  Nothing.

That'll be the day.

Make some money, Dick, prove yourself to the Wall Street crowd and let Goldwater and Rockefeller take the fall against Kennedy.

You need her, Dick -- in '60 she was worth five, six million votes.

It broke my heart when Harold died.

I wanna fight just as dirty as he does.

Syracuse.

Oh yeah ... she really is ... wholesome.

Yes, I understand that.

I know.  I know.  I've seen a lot of kids die, too, in World War II.

Sir?

Well, we could delete it.

... and get rid of all these "goddamns" and "Jesus Christs"!

Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think, Buddy?  Go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid, some money at the end of the line ... You know, I keep thinking of my old man tonight.  He was a failure, too.

I suppose Castro staged the whole thing just to beat you.

It's over, Dick.

You're ruining us.  If we stay with you, you'll take us down with you.  This isn't political, Dick.  This is our life.

If I stop ... there'll be no more talk of divorce?

Do you really want this, Dick?

I've missed you.

I was thinking tonight -- do you remember, Dick?  Do you remember when you used to drive me on dates with the other boys?  You didn't want to let me out of your sight.

Yes, it's been a long time ...

Is that adjusted for inflation?  Think of the life Mao's led.  In '52 I called him a monster.  Now he could be our most important ally.  Only Nixon could've done that.

Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been calling.  But you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted, will you pardon him?

They were for me.  They're mine.

Who else'd be in your truck.

I deduced it. Once you walked in.

In Angola. Yeah.

I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.

Yes, you've circled round.

I'm... discouraged.

No ID in her room?

Try "old" on for size.

Would you tell me if you had?

Mm.

So when was he here?

Sheriff?

No, that's the only thing I would've looked for. And it sounds like these boys died of natural causes.

You want me to wait til you've quit the building?

Well. If you say so.

Okay. Two of 'em. Both had my father. It's peculiar. I'm older now'n he ever was by twenty years. So in a sense he's the younger man. Anyway, first one I don't remember so well but it was about meetin' him in town somewheres and he give me some money and I think I lost it. The second one, it was like we was both back in older times and I was on horseback goin' through the mountains of a night.

I didn't see my Prednizone.

Well I didn't see it.

To your husband.

Your husband had the opportunity to remove you from harm's way. Instead, he used you to try to save himself.

Yes. Things fall into place.

No. I found it.

You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.

You keep running that mouth I'm gonna take you in the back and screw you.

That'll work.

Well -- how come?

I'm gonna borrow a car. From Eldon.

Don't wanna register it. I'll call you in a couple days.

Yes I do.

You should be used to that.

Not any more, Carla Jean. You're retired.

Hey.

What did you tell him?

I know where it's going to be.

Yes I did.

Is Llewelyn there?

In the truck.  I'll get it.

Huh? Airport or airstrip?

I don't need to talk to you.

Why would I care where you're going.

Yeah. I know where you're going.

He feels... he felt... the more people looking...

What time do you close?

I could come back then.

You live in that house behind the store?

You married into it.

No.

Never mind.  I want a tent.

Let me have that one. Where's the nearest hardware store?

That's twenty-six dollars.

Why don't I set you down here and we won't argue about it.

Yes?

The what?

Oh. That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?

I know what it is. He won't find me again.

Not any way.

I'm retired.

What did I say?

If I was cuttin' deals, why wouldn't I go deal with this guy Chigurh?

He don't talk as much as you, I give him points for that.

No sir.

No sir. I'm a veteran.

Twelfth Infantry Batallion. August seventh nineteen and sixty-six to July second nineteen and sixty-eight.

It's a type of altered state... it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning.

I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.  That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...

We think we know where Betty is.

She said she was in Arizona, did she?

I know that...

No, I didn't have to.

What about it?

Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!

I am?

"Thirty-two?"

Yes, but I'd sort of like to put that behind me now...

...what're you saying?

Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. You must know him. He's incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. He's being sued for sexual assault right now, but --  It's not true. He was set up.

Oh, Betty --

Maroon.  I stole it.

All the time...

What are you talking about?

I take it I should. I'm sorry.

But I'm the one who's sorry. Letting you go was the biggest mistake of my life.  We were thirteen days away from getting married and... I just got scared. It's a mistake I've had to live with for six years. But it's behind me now...  And I hope you can put it behind you. I've missed you... David.

The day I left you I just drove and drove. I drove all day and all that night, and I didn't go anywhere. I just kept driving. I stopped at a little country church, and the pastor let me in, and I sat --

No, Del.

Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...

At last! I know how much you want this. You're gifted and extremely determined, but... it's not up to me.

Didn't I?

It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...

Why am I doing this to you? Isn't this what you wanted?

What do you mean? What did I do to you...

...What? What did you call me? George... McCord. You're my favorite actor on...

Why are you screaming at me? I mean, what am I... why am I here? I don't...

I got you, Del...

I came for love...

Make sure it's elevated...

Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...

You did? Was it anyone that you...?

I begged him to let me put that on!

Williams, Arizona. About halfway there, I guess.

Wait, I thought you said you'd never been outta Kansas...

I s'pose his name's David Ravell.

You made out alright.

You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you...

Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?

I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.

I came for love. My fiancé is here.

'David.' That's your guy. So, you staying with him?

The one you were telling me about?

Ummm... no, no. Different 'Ravell.'

He has a wife?!

Rosa, I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you.

You said in L.A., anything goes.

What? Where was he?!

If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money?

Fine.

He is real.

No, almost never.

I'm going back to... I need to... I don't know.

Thanks so much. You must get bothered by this kind of thing a lot.

Georgia. In case I didn't tell you, it's cash only, gentlemen.

You know, it's interesting. The South lost the Civil War, but they still seem to get all the glory.

Oh, yes, with the coffee...

Are you kidding me? What's to like?

Are we gonna do business here, or not?

Hmmmm. "Five Stars," huh?  Is that stupid, Wesley?

My socks?

...and put them in your mouth.

Wesley...  Your wife's a very lovely woman. Have I seen her before?

So you see, we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not. Don't we?

A mark, huh?

You told me how to do it!

I wasn't done, I was just sick of hearing him whine. And you didn't take him out, you scalped him. Christ, I almost puked, did I tell you that?

...that's a good motto.

Should I kill him now?

Half.

They paid us half. They still owe us half...

You know, blonde, thin, whatever...

I said, 'No.' N-O.

Do you hear yourself right now...? Like a fucking madman...

Well... I think I saw her soul.

Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.

You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman...

It just didn't fit her profile...

She can't be here because of a... a soap opera. Not a soap opera. That'd make her...

What do you mean?

You better believe it.

Yeah, bring your friend along. I'm sure you got a lot of catching up to do...

No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember?

I said I'll think about it.

Then do as you're told. Get her back.

Uh-huh.

Sure.

...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?

Ahh, I hate this town! Places like this just make you small...  I should have never come back here after college.

The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --

She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.

"A Reason to Love."

I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around...

It's Sue Ann Rogers, Betty Sizemore's friend? I heard from her.

Gopher, Everett?

Yeah, it stinks in that ol' barn.

Yeah, let's negotiate 'em, Everett.

Four hundred, Delmar.

I left my pomade in that car! Maybe I can creep up!

Now you may call it an unreasoning optimism. You may call it obtuse. But the plain fact is we still have... close to... close to...

Course it's Pete! Look at 'im!

Boys, we was chained together. I hadda tell ya somethin'. Bustin' out alone was not a option!

Is the marriage off then, Miz Wharvey?

Okay, Pappy.

Assa good idea, Pappy.

Well, it's a well-run campaign, midget'n broom'n whatnot.

Well now, I don't believe assa property scription.

Now Penny, stop that!

Ain't gonna be no weddin'.

You said -

I don't care if it's ninety thousand.

Don't I know it.

Sell that. I figured it could only have painful associations for Wash.

Join you two ignorant fools in a ridiculous superstition? Thank you anyway.  And I like the smell of my hair treatment - the pleasing odor is half the point.

What about you, Delmar? What're you gonna do with your share a that dough?

I couldn't wait two weeks! She's gettin' married tomorra!

Eighty-four years old! I'll be gummin' pab-you-lum!

Wait a minute - who elected you leader a this outfit? Since we been followin' your lead we got nothin' but trouble! I gotten this close to bein' strung up, n'consumed in a fire, 'n whipped no end, 'n sunstroked, 'n soggied -

How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom Boys?

Well that record has just gone through the goddamn roof! They're playin' it as far away as Mobile! The whole damn state's goin' ape!

Hot damn, we gotta find those boys! Sign 'em to a big fat contract! Hell's bells, Mr. Lunn, if we don't the goddamn competition will!

Well he's the reform candidate, Daddy.

You got a maiden name, Daddy?

Thank you, sir!

Zack, you little shit! You haven't changed a bit!

Yeah, I sort of thought so myself.

Just trying to have fun. That fucking prison is really starting to get to me. C'mon, Seeger. Gimme a push.  Fuck you guys! I'll do it myself!

A long time ago.

I don't mean anything by it.

Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.

No, sir. You can kick me out, but I'm not quitting.

No, sir! It was the hardest thing I ever did, sir! Until this.

That's no reason. Everybody wants to fly. My grandmother wants to fly. You going after a job with one of the airlines?

Yes, sir!

It's important, sir!

I'll never forget you as long as I live, Sergeant.

Yeah. See you in the fleet, Sarge. And thank you.

I called you Sarge.

No, sir.

Yeah.

Like pick up some booze and go to a motel?

Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.

What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility.

Oklahoma. I can get my old job back at JC Penney's. In a couple of years, I'll be floor manager. Oh, you're gonna love Oklahoma, Lynette. You and mama'll get along just great. Of course, money will be a little tight for a while, but we'll make it.

Don't worry. It grows out about an inch by them.

Great.

Yeah... Mmmm...

No, but I told him I'd be at the Town Tavern next Saturday night, and he sounded like he might come.

I haven't made up my mind.

What do you mean?

Already come and gone. Can you believe it? He DORed in the twelfth week. How can you win?

You're no better than me, Paula! You're just the same!

Of course. I don't want no Okie from Muscogee. I can get that right here in Port Angeles.

Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?

No, and I'm not looking for one either.

Not me.

No. I work for National Paper. It's a good job. I make eight-twenty-three an hour.  When I get enough money saved, I plan to go on to college.

Any time, sailor.

Zack, I don't know if I want to do that...

Are those for me?

What would you do differently?

Come on, Paula! You were looking for a ticket out of here and you didn't care who it was, any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and Lynette fucked your way through, looking for a husband! Or the class before that!

That's brilliant.

Sorry, pard. Wouldn't want you to get an honor violation.

He said he grew up poor?

Sure it is, Sweet Pea, but he should've warned you 'scuzzy' female types about the 'Puget Dudes.' They'll tell you they're wearing a rubber but they've bit a little hole in the end.

Not if you make it worth my while. How about free boonies for the duration?

Shhhh...

A little.

Remember what Foley said? His little warning? Those are the girls he was talking about. They're out to marry us any way they can.

But it can't wait.

Just like that it's all over? With less than two weeks to go, you're out?

I don't get it! He's the best candidate in our class! Ask anyone! The best student! The best leader! The best friend to everybody! Couldn't you bend your goddamn standards just a little?

God.

Make her come out.  And when she does, that's when we gotta be careful.  She can't get out of this house.  She can't even think she can get out of this house.  We just keep them here and keep them quiet for forty-five minutes.  And I don't want  Joe Pesci here standing over them with his fat sweaty finger on the trigger.  That's a sure way for us to end up with two dead bodies and little puffs of smoke burning out of our heads up in Greenhaven.  So we're gonna seal the place up.  They wanna hole up in here?  Fine, we'll help 'em.  Make it impossible for them to leave.  Once they come out of that room.

Just sending a message.  She'll get the point.

Who's the clown now?  Huh?!  Who's the fucking clown now?!

I can't...

This is ridiculous...

Yeah.  Yeah, I got an idea.  I gotta check something.

Yeah.  She can.  She's fine, she's just like, tired, she's gotta rest. You rest, Kid.  Half an hour.

You finish.  Then we finish.

We've got the Kid!  WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!!  What the fuck is she thinking?!

Keep your voice down.

Exactly how is fourteen days almost three weeks?

Different tables.

No ball, kid.

He's talking about Bernard Pearlstine.

Open it.

Don't!

I don't think so, but I love her album.

Open the door.

What do they want?

Feel okay?

Shaky?

Chills?

"Get the fuck out of my house."

No.

I'm dizzy and thirsty.

What if I keep dropping?

But nothing, we want full fledged membership in the Black Panther Party... and none of this "Okay sugah as long as you stay in the background washing my socks and rubbing my feet" bullshit either!

What?!? Don't tell me you're buying this?

You gotta. You gotta stay alive. You know what they were trying to do here. You got the pigs dead to rights. It's like Huey said, you're more important than any of us.

What it be is, You aren't coming with us.

That's just it Huey. The pigs don't know how many Panthers there are. Both of us show and they might start putting 2 and 2 together. We're not even two hundred strong yet... but we got 'em guessing thousands.

Hold up a second... We got a decision to make.

Brimmer! Could you come in here please?

I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.

I got you.

What's with you?

Yeah, it's me.

Who's they?

Look this is bull...

No man. PE -- "political education."

N... N...... Not... Oh.

It's a bit more like how can we help you. Bay Area's become quite a hornet's nest in terms of subversive activities. And... well Mr. Hoover wants to reiterate that the FBI will be happy to assist local authorities in any way we can. On a strictly advisory basis... of course.

I see. What about the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense?

Are you finished?

We're like policing the police.

You know I think Brother Judge needs our support right now, not our suspicion  This is beautiful man. Folks around here never read the truth like this before.

A gun's a gun man. It don't need to be loaded.

I'm down.

Don't I know it. Every brother I knew in 'Nam's dead. My company... a land mine. Twenty of my friends dead in less than a second.

Right on Brother Judge...

You got that right. And brother, I got a feeling it's going to get a whole lot thicker.

But nothing... you do live here don't you?

What you see is what you got.  That's' Bobby Seale.

Maybe...

Just the legit shit.

Mothafucker! You just set Bobby Seale up to be kidnapped. They dragged him off to some bullshit conspiracy trial in Chicago. How much the pigs pay you for this one, Judge? 

What are you saying?

Look... You... take her and get the hell out of here. I'll keep 'em busy.

Funny you don't look like church folk to me.

Where is he?.

Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.

You don't look alright.

I saw. I saw that big one  hit that police man. Saw 'em drag you off too.  They take you to jail?

It's alright.  I'm very happy for you.

I expect to try.

Don't fault him for having grown up on the frontier.  It was a harder time and a harder place than you know.

First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton.

With a lace table cloth?

Let us.  Unless you object, I would like to deem this meeting a formal negotiation and, as such, there are certain customary practices. Perhaps I could explain them to you...

Oh?

Restrain them from the targeting of civilians, including women and children?

Prisoner exchange.

If that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die. Nineteen, if you hang me with my men.

Are you going to meet with him?

Yes.  He seeks a levy of troops and money.

You're in no condition to ride.

We put out the word.  We'll start along the south side of the Santee...

You know how old I am.

And the dogs, too, I'll wager.

I should have killed him when I had the chance?

She'd say it to me when I picked on Thomas or Nathan.

She said that?  Oh, my Lord, she said that?

Is it her?  Is Anne in there?

Go on.

Yes, I do.  I hate him and I hope he never comes back.

Please.

Thank you.  Were I an orator, those are the exact words I would have spoken.

Balderdash!

That's what I'm doing.  I will not fight and because I won't, I will not cast a vote that will send others to fight in my stead.

I'm sorry.

When?

So you're going to try to keep Cornwallis in the South until then.

How many men does Cornwallis have under his command?

Robert.  Robert E. Lee.

I'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley.

That will be all, Major.  I'll wait for Lord Cornwallis.

I heard about your son.  I'm sorry.

About a hundred and twenty.  Less than a third.

Quiet.

Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do.

Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it?

Is that right, dad?

But what if he dies and has to go to the Pet Sematary?

I will. Come and kiss me.

Yayyy!

For a little while.

Well, it's always better to take precautions--but I'm sure Church will be all right, honey...

Lovey...Church might be still alive when you're in a high school...and that's a very long time.

Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation!

Well, I think Michael McDowell is so full of shit he probably squeaks when he walks, my dear.

I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think?

Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?

I'm sure you're not.

The Eat A Peach album. God, they were good before drugs and bad luck caught up with them. Listen to this, Louis.

Sure.

Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile.

I think it is so, Ellie.

For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't go because her old man thinks I'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow night. Jud, what's this about?

Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus.

Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?

Just don't stop, Louis. You don't ever want to stop down here in Little God.  And you don't ever want to look behind you, whatever you hear.

Whose burying ground?

Why? For God's sake, why?

Don't worry about that.

Yes.

It's Ellie's cat.

Did you see his shirt?

That's forgotten.

They'll be anchored on the lee side.  Haul your wind, and keep to the weather of the island --

Aye, aye, sir!

That fool woman took it.  You be careful around her, Jack -- she's pretty enough, she'll steal your heart -- but pure evil inside.

All right then.

Aye, for us there is.

Or you could surrender.

And he's got Old Bill's courage. A curse on him, and you!

By the powers, you're right!  Where's Jack's pistol?  Who's got it?  Bring it forward!

My holds are bursting with swag. That bit of shine matters to me ... Why?

Will -- you can't trust him.

Think again, Miss Swann. Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirate brand, gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.

Boy overboard!

His name is Will Turner -- that's all I found out.

He can locate Isla de Muerta -- but I doubt he'll be willing to help us from the brig.

Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home.  That is what we shall do.  Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable.  But so was his decision to engage in piracy.

Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.

I guess you can never truly know someone else's heart.

Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter that we are of a different class --

I saved your life; now you've saved mine.  We're square.

No, I'm -- rescuing you.

The trees are taller.

A month?  Will doesn't have a month!  We've got to do something to help him!

More to drink!

You'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the Spanish Main.

You -- you burned up the island, for a one-time chance at being spotted?

I have a plan.  If it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief ... and one-sided.

Well, fortunately, I know how to counter it.  The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition.

Now where, I wonder, would they have gotten that idea?

I know.  That was for the smell.

What?  He never told me that.

The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.

I don't think that will be necessary.

Sorry, I didn't know.

They left me stranded.  Twice. What have you got to lose?

I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.

I do.  And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.

Pirate.

Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.

My business, Will.  As for your business -- one question, or there's no use going.  This girl -- what does she mean to you?  How far are you willing to go to save her?

Commandeer.  We're going to commandeer a ship.  Nautical term.

'Bootstrap?'

That's not true.

It's not true my father was a pirate.

My father -- was not -- a pirate!

You didn't beat me.  You ignored the rule of engagement.  In a fair fight, I'd kill you.

Oh -- did I forget to mention that?

On whether the stories are all true.  If they are, that's a waterfall that spills over at high tide, with a short drop to an underground lagoon.  If not --

Mentioned it, is more what he did.

My apologies, Governor.

No.  She hasn't.

A moment.

But in another twenty-four hours the core meltdown will be beyond the stabilization period.  There will be no way to stop it.

Come with me, Susan.  I want to show you something.

No, thank you.

How do you know we're not heading in the wrong direction?

A light mixture of oxygen, dioxide, and sodium pentothal.  He'll sleep, that's all.

Wow, that is one moving story.  Take it easy on my heart strings.  Now I really feel guilty complaining about you shooting me up with your poison.

It's ready now, I know it is.

She's lying.  She lost the first one on purpose.

Now, Icky, I don't need you winding yourself up.  I need you focused and in control.

No, Icky, this is real.

Oh yes, Icky.  I can feel it.

The nanobot is gone.

That might work.

Thank you, sir.

Why don't you just put this in your pocket so when you see a garbage can you can put it where it belongs.

What are you going to do?  Make me throw it out?

Oh yeah.  They were working on molecular assemblers, too, weren't they?

They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing.

The replicators?

It's Sim.  We're almost there.

I've only been invited to her house once, but I know there is a basement lab that she uses for private research.

Yes.  That's it.  He's got it.  Oh God, he's got it!

You know, this and that.

And for cleaning up oil spills.

Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I have to be going.

We'll see how wonderful it is after you spend the next twenty years making Agent Orange.

Susan, this is the future of America here.

Once the subject was polymerized we were unable to reassemble the original organic structure.

We don't?

Got it.

What about it!

I don't consider uncontrollable toxic waste progress!

But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!

I was hoping you were over that. Remember to keep drinking fluids.

I'm not leaving without you, Susan!

You don't have to say anything, Daniel.  I'm a scientist.  I know what's happening.  I recognize the classic symptoms.  Dizziness, shortness of breath, sweating palms... I can feel my adrenals secreting, my parasympathetic nervous system quivering, the estradiol coursing through my entire body...

The same thing I suppose.

You were looking for us?

Mr. Sim?  Do you have him?  He's alive?

And you have him?

Is that a threat, Dr. Bright?

Get him, Daniel!  Knock his block off!

Yes, that is what I was thinking.

Pipe down, brain lady!  And you...

Thank you. I'll go and look for her at once. Goodbye, Mrs. Smith.

Oh, thank you, I knew you'd understand.

Certainly. Right over there.

Yeah, that was considerate of me. I recommend you read it.

Just a moment. I don't see how that trash could possibly concern me.

So, it's obvious, huh?

Sure, I'll take a chance.

I'm afraid she's right, Mrs. Schuyler. I'm really very sorry, Mrs. Schuyler, that you feel this way. I was in hopes that you would like me. I'm not the burglar that you think I am. After all, we're married. I think the thing to do is to kiss and make up - Mother.

When 'we' . . .?  You mean, you'd like to have me live here in your house?

Oh darling, of course it would. If it isn't - there are six rooms and two baths - but if that isn't enough, Mother will give us the blue room too, I think.

Of course I am Stewart.

Besides I'd look foolish. I couldn't look Gallagher in the face.

Oh, no I won't my dear - oh, no I won't my dear - I'll wash behind my ears, but no I won't my dear!

Why, down at the office, we always look at Gallagher as - eh - just Gallagher, that's all.

Stewart, would you mind telling me why you're not going?

Are you crazy?

Good morning. What does this mean?

Unreasonable!  Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom?

You can't walk out of here like this.

Oh, hello Mother!

Pardon me, Mr. Smith is engaged. We are having a reception here this evening

I'll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir. Have a seat.

Thanks, I will.

I know, I know. But there's no truth in the story whatsoever.

All right, all right, don't mention it.

Hey, make up your mind, will you?

Oh, nothing. I just blew over - I wanted to see how the old newshound looked made up for a gentleman.

Oh boy, I'd love it.

It isn't a question of knowing what to do, it's knowing how to get in one that counts.

Gloria Golden?

The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?

No, no - it's true, all right, only we didn't want to get it in print yet, that's all.

Now get this, Conroy. My name is Smith. Always was Smith - and always gonna be Smith.

Yeah, live on my salary - that is, until I finish writing my play.

No!

I like my bath all right. How do you like your bath?

I'm your valet, sir. Dawson is the name, sir.

Your valet, sir.

Thank you, sir.

There you are. You caught on. You see, you're nice and you're smart too. You caught on right away. Outside! Go on! Outside! And don't come back!

On now, Stew, don't be too hard on her. I wouldn't call her a brewery horse.

Pay attention? I'm not paying any attention to him. You think that guy could get me upset? Hah! Not that mug. He's a tough mug - hard, cynical. He doesn't know the fine things in life - that guy.  A bird in a gilded cage, huh? It's getting so a guy can't step out without being called a magnolia. Stew Smith, a magnolia! Not me. Say, I'm not going to hang around and be a speakeasy rat all my life! I'll tell you that. Not me, not me. I'm going to step out and mean something in this world. You watch me.  Say, am I a lucky guy to be near Anne Schuyler?  I've been hit with a carload of horseshoes, and believe me I know it. Lucky, I'll say I'm lucky!  Don't you think I'm lucky, Gallagher?

Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.

Yes - and I'd love it.

Conrad.

Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...

Yeah?

The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.

Certainly! I'll take care of this guy Bingy myself, personally.  Now what are you crying about?

Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast.

I beg your pardon.

Don't think. Let me do all the thinking. Now you go back to that Schuyler outfit and tell them that I didn't marry that dame for her dough and I don't want any of her dough now. I was too poor to buy her a wedding present when we got married, so I'm giving her a divorce for a wedding present. Now, stand up!

Hello, Joe.

With pleasure, Madame!

All right, Grandma

Have you seen this? 

Smythe, come here. I want to talk to you.  Come on, Smythe, talk to me. Smythe, I'm going nuts. I'm going nuts in this house! This big . . . come on, I'm not going to hurt you. Come on, what's the matter with you?

Yes, sir.

Me, sir?

Well sir, I'll show you.

No! Well, well, well! That's all right, if you like it. Can anybody do that?

Thanks.

What do you mean?

Yes.

No, I ... I was just ... worried about her.

I can't go out there. How can I go out there?

Looks just like it did.

Sure.

No ...

I don't want it to go away.

Where are you gonna go?

Well "gee whizz" Biff. I sure am glad you asked me.

Really Biff? The keenest?

Oh you bet.  Will you excuse me for a sec?

I think ... I might be ill ...

What are you doing?

Why not?

With what?

What?

Gee whizz, Bud. Guess I'll just have the usual. Cheeseburger and a cherry coke.

I'm fine--but thank you.

I really don't know.  Ben Miller's son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market.

Thank you very much.

No. Of course not.

Yes I do.

Why am I out of order?

Um ... Outside of Pleasantville.

Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.

Yes.

Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.

David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...

No way.

I don't know.

What's going to happen?

Just take deep breaths.

Well, yeah. I'm ... Bud Parker and you're ... um--Mary Sue.

One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.

Just watch. You know why those guys just get cats out of trees? 'Cause nothing burns around here, that's why! They don't need any firemen ...

He won't notice anyway.

They don't notice that kind of thing.

Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late for work.

Nothing.

It's fine.

Sure.

Yes.

What?

Honestly ... no.

No. You baked them for Whitey.

You don't know?

They just grow like that?

Yeah ... You don't have rain either?

I'm not sure.

Easy. Mr. Jenkins. What JOB did Mr. Jenkins have?

Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's tomorrow at noon.

Yeah ... Sort of ...

Nice ... Nice ...

I can't.

Re-runs?

Terrific. I'll talk to you then.

I'm going to leave now.

I'm going on trial tomorrow?

Well--I always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then I make the french fries ...

But you didn't come so I kept on wiping.

What?

Hi there. You took off so quick. I wasn't sure if you were okay.

What are you talking about! You make hamburgers! That is the point!

Why?

No, that's not it.

You're gonna keep painting aren't you?

This isn't funny! I happen to have a very important date in like five minutes!

Hey.

Cool.

So you can't talk to me?

Somewhere in Utah.

There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight.

She's really cute and she's really nice.

Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.

I don't do that. I don't - things like that.

I don't know.

Nothing. I'm just at work and I'm wondering, you know your friend Lena?

......she forgot her purse at my work and I wanted to get it back to her.

I....please don't do this.

There is no reason for you to treat me like you do -- you're killing me, you are killing me with the way that you are towards me --

Nothing, huh, do you know what I'm doing?

Do you like porno movies?

Yeah. And looking at myself in the mirror. Do you wanna know what I look like?

Yeah....you're married aren't you, Jack?

You sound very cute, very nice.

Hey. What are you doing? How are you?

It's ok that I'm calling, right, I mean? It's ok.

Remember last night I was talking to you and I was telling you about my apartment, my rent -- ?  Do you remember?

This is really weird and really embarrassing for me but....uh....  I was wondering if you could help me out with a little bit of money.

Yeah.

Really? Please?

I need help.

No I'm sorry, now I have to get off the phone....

Hi.

It's fine. It was fun, though.

That's not mine it's one of the guys that works here. That pudding's not mine.

Really?

-- well, if you're gonna go --

-- oh that's too bad, it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something --

Ok.

Sure.

Yeah.

It's Barry.

About six months.

Yeah?

Yeah.

Yeah.

So that was your pudding?

Nothing.

Did something happen; are you alright?

Yes? I'm trying.

I just wanted you to know, wherever you're going or whatever you're doing right now I want you to know that I wanted to kiss you just then.

Thank you.

It's Barry.

You don't have a boyfriend or anything do you?

What's that? What is that that you're doing?

I think maybe over a hundred.

It's ok to ask that.

What is this?

If they break or something. What is it, plastic?

For what?

Just have you for one second, please.

Why? ...what?

Yeah, but I didn't do anything.

That's fine.

Yes it is.

...3407 2627 3444 8095 expiration 05/04.

Can you say that my name is Jack?

I just don't want anyone to know it's me.

I thought I was just gonna be connected to talk to a girl - that's fine, ok, I'm sorry, it's, um.....818....

We back our plungers 100% and we do ask for a 30 to 60 day display on the floor.....

I think you have a call?

I didn't know you had a sister?

I wanted to ask you because you're a doctor, right?

It takes that much time to process the order and make sure it's valid --

It takes time to process --

Yes I'm fine.

I have to talk to you in a second about that, Lance, ok?

....I made a call.....  ....and, uh....

Where you goin?

You can't be late.

Seriously.

Ok.

Can we maybe ask for more money on this?

I'm only paying two of you guys.

Hey, it's me. This guy from L.A., Barry Egan is calling on the other line and saying all this stuff, he wants to talk to a supervisor or whatever --

No, no. This is bad, something might have happened, we should just --

No.

Should I call you later?

We oughtn't be reading his nasty stories --

"...a poker... he took a poker from the fire..."

Not now, or we're both done for.

Don't say that; reading's my salvation.

He's not the man who's cast a shadow here.

I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name --

It's not even a proper novel! It's nothing but an encyclopedia of perversions! Frankly, it even fails as an exercise in craft. The characters are wooden; the dialogue is inane. Not to mention the endless repetition of words like "nipple" and "pikestaff" --

But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?

More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.

You among them?

I don't know who you insult more; her or me.

Valcour. His chair.

-- and your meat shall be de-boned.

I know, because I felt it myself --

Why was it you never took her by force?

Tomorrow, we'll cut out your tongue.

I'm here.

Playing dress-up with cretins? That sounds like a symptom of madness; not its cure.

His wife's influence.

Well...?

Do you favor its publication?

I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here.

Of course.

What could cause a tincture like this?

Madeleine's not wicked. It's the Marquis who's corrupted her. That's not her fault; it's mine.

A word of caution, Sire: we all remember what happened to Robespierre, Danton and Marat. Put the Marquis to death, and history might even regard you as a despot.

I'm afraid so; he's an idealist. You'll have to be politic.

Maybe someday you'll tell me your name.

Such gallantry in men is -- sadly -- a rarity; How lucky I am to receive his charity!

Don't start --

Your publisher says I'm not to leave without a new manuscript.

Is it awfully violent?

The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.

What's that then?

It's only been described to me. In your books.

You're far crueler than I, my sweet.

How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?

-- who'll whisper it to Bouchon --

Yes! You shall. Of course you shall --

Something to make the angels weep, and the Saints to gasp for air...

Tell him -- if he uncovers our whereabouts -- you'll slit your wrists with a razor, and I'll plunge a hat- pin through my heart.

No. But tell him I would.

Desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy.

Oh you do, do you? It is my dearest hope, Doctor, that he remain entombed forever, and that when at last he perishes in the dank bowels of your institution, he be left as carrion for the rodents and the worms.

And I in yours.

Of course.

Am I a cursed woman, Doctor? Must I be betrayed by every man I meet --

....shame on you, truly...

You've come to lecture me?

I can't

Over at RKO?

You oughta lay off him -- he is the p-p-president, after all.

How much?

Yes.

We are in no "pickle" -- as you would euphemistically have it.

You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--

You needn't use that language with me

Not for me.

Tough shit. We need to t-t-talk about this--

Thank you, sir. She begins to leave

"You don't care about anything except you. You just want to persuade people that you

"A toast then, Jedediah, to love on my own terms. Those are the only terms anybody ever knows, his own."

We're using-

I'm not fucking with Hughes. That shit-kicker would kill us dead, baby. Just like Jean Harlow

Who the hell's Manolete?

I don't wanna write about no spic.

So speaks the court jester.

How does it feel, Mank? Going up to the palace and making all the lords and ladies laugh as you tell your little stories and beg for crumbs at the table? How does it feel being the ugly little monkey they keep to amuse themselves--?!

She was . . . innocent

And what does he see?

Yeah, but the margins are real wide.

Good?! Good?! Words fail you at last! It's terrific! Now I'll have to do some shaping, of course, and some of the scenes aren't exactly . . . exactly . . .

Uh huh.

Fuck you.  You wanted me out. I'm out.

"And how is the country to feel when this industry continues to employ bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees instead of real Americans? Doesn't Hollywood know there's a Depression on? Don't real Americans deserve work?"

Christ.

Yeah, you're probably right.

I, um, need an estimate on some jewelry I might wish to sell. But d-d-discretion is very important to me b-b-because I don't want anyone t-t-to, um, know that--

Thank you -- b-b-but I'd really like t-t-to--

No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it.

Again

Please don't ask me to do this.

The ad..

It was a -joke, George

No, we're jake. But listen-

Happy birthday.

Relax, George. It's gonna go great. Trust me. Have I ever lied to you?

We done?

I know where you're from. You guys look the same every place.

Tommy, thanks for coming over.

I want to believe you, LaMotta.

Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw.

No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I know her like that -- not like that.

She ever go with them? Like Salvy?

What does that have to do with it? She don't look 15 to me. I heard somethin' with Salvy. She was with him once or somethin', I think. It was like some blonde. That's the one...

Yeah, she's nice.

Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked him down. What did I do wrong? I don't understand.

No, take her home. I wanna be alone for a while. Everybody go.

You want the title shot?

Didn't you just see her lookin' at him? She told me no, but I don't believe her.

When I'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? Tell me the truth.

What did Tommy say?

Yeah, I know.

Ain't a cheek ever good enough for you? I never even kissed Mama on the mouth.

Jack, no. I just explained the whole thing to you. It was just between me and Salvy, if it had anything to do with you and Vickie, I woulda told you about it.

You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...

Then why did you give him a beatin' if he didn't do anything? You and him been friends a long time.

I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head.

So what?

I gotta go. I gotta get outta here. I can't take this shit. Lenore is waitin' for me. I gotta go. You're a definite wacko. You're fuckin' crazy, you know that, crazy.

Does that mean...

I just wanted to say hello.

Can you see it?

No.

Now take your panties off.

Yeah.

Nobody. I love you, remember?

What did I say?

What did I do?

Oh, c'mon. For Christsake, do I have to tell you everything?

What're you talking about?

I am answering...

Yeah --

OK. Talk.

What do I say to him? Call him up on the phone and say, "Joey, I'm sorry about that little trouble we had. How about havin' dinner?" Is that what I say?

I'm leaving you Jake.

No. This time it's true. I didn't bother to tell you until I had everything worked out.

No. I won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.

I got a lawyer, Jake. We're getting a divorce. I'm getting custody of the kids.

I promise I just gotta pick up one thing.

I need ten thousand dollars. My lawyer says if we can spread ten thousand bucks around, we can get the case dropped.

He should.

Yeah, the weight's Ok.

Get lost.  Hey kids, "A cop is a rat." Remember that, "A rat."

Look, I'm just tellin' you how Tommy feels. Jake is makin' it hard on himself. Tommy wants him with us. It's as simple as that.

Joey, relax. You're taking this the wrong way. Why don't you sit down and have a drink?

Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter of time.

You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared.

He has it. Thank you.

Jefferies?

When the lock is broken -- yes.

Go ahead, Doyle -- tell me he's an unemployed magician -- amusing the neighborhood with sleight-of-hand.

For instance?

Then where is she -- in the ice box?

Well then do a good job of it! Get over there, and search Thorwald's apartment! It must be knee-deep in evidence.

He has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there.

You figured that out, huh?

Your logic is backward.

That depends on who "they" were.

Where'd they take Lisa?

Maybe you won't need it. I'll run it down, Jeff.

Wrong week. Next Wednesday I emerge from this plaster cocoon.

Listen -- if you don't pull me out of this swamp of boredom -- I'll do something drastic.

Well -- you know best. Call you later, Jeff.

Gunnison?

It's not an ordinary look. It's the kind of look a man gives when he's afraid somebody might be watching him.

You called the police?

There's something buried there.

Look!

There's probably one in the basement.

That'll get her out of there, won't it?

To bail Lisa out of jail.

Jeff again.  Has Tom come in yet?

He knows.  Don't worry, Tess. It's a man.

Goodnight, Mrs Doyle.

Not too active.

Uh-huh.

We sell a dozen a day in this price range.

Tell me -- what was Slim Hayward wearing?

You mean leave the magazine?

She's not in love with him -- or any of them.

There's nothing I'm hiding. It's just that --

Three.

Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong.

Right now, it doesn't seem so.

There's nothing wrong with you, Lisa. You have the town in the palm of your hand.

There's nothing to see.

Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't know, and I don't care. Lots of people have saws, knives and ropes around their houses. Lots of men don't speak to their wives all day. Lots of wives nag, and men hate them, and trouble starts -- but very, very, very few of them end up in murder -- if that's what you're thinking.

I don't know.

Thinking about Thorwald?

Not a word. He was going to check on the railroad station, and the trunk. He must be still on it.

Because she didn't know she was going on a trip -- and where she was going she wouldn't need a handbag.

I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.

Night. I'm going to stay with you.

That's a suitcase?

The same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls, and over-passionate daughters of the rich.

Who was the trunk addressed to?

I'm not much on rear window ethics.

I think I'll start reviving it tomorrow, with say -- Miss Torso for a start?

Thank you.

Is he cleaning house?

It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.

It could be -- the knife, and the saw.

Your name?

What's eating you, Judy?  You want him alive?

Who's fighting?  This is the test, man.  It's a crazy game.

Hi.

Smashed the front door.

Down in back.

Is there some kind of trick answer?

I was in it.

I don't want to learn that!

Really, Frank?  When was that?

Just relax, please relax!

Did anyone see you there?  I mean did they get your license number or anything?

That's right!

What's that pounding?

Where's your mother tonight, Plato?

Plato.

In my mother's drawer.

I don't want to make friends.

I saw it.  Gee, look at that thing swing, will you?  Do you think it never stops?

If you want to come we could talk and then in the morning we could have breakfast like my dad used to--  Gee...if you could only have been my father...we could...

Shut up.  Are you nuts?

Wow!  Well now-there-then!

Not lately.

We didn't run out.  We were coming right back.

Sure I'm sure.  Judy's waiting. You ready to come out now?

What do you think?

They like you.  Okay?

All right, darling.

I have to talk to someone, Mom.  I have to talk to you both.  And Dad this time you got to give me an answer.

You're not going to use me as an excuse again, Mom.  Every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse.  Now I want to do one thing right and I'm not letting you run away.  Dad?

Hang loose, boy.  I'm warning you.

Mess that kid up?

So then you moved?

She eats him alive and he takes it.

What?

Bully for you.

Now that's true!

Who lives?

A what?

I'm not so bad.

You were looking for me, weren't you?

There's just one thing.  What about--

See, we're very modern.

Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.

I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato.  That was nice.

So do you.

We have to go back!

He hates me.

Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--

My mother?

I didn't kiss her so it's a big thing.

I'm tired, Judy.  I'd like to change the subject.

Don't hurt him...

NO!

We're talking, aren't we?

...whoever she is.

To all those cons...

He'll be dead when he does.

I got fifty dollars to spend in your store, Jesus of Nazareth. Can you help me or not?

One more. Smile. One more.

I've been dreaming about that smile, Ashley Mercer. For a long time.

Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean --

What the fuck is going on.

What's going ON!!!

Nick, no --

I won't let him hurt you! He just wants what you know!

Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at least gotten that --

Nick, the ice is --

...Haven't had cranberry buns... in five whole years...

I don't know...

If he wanted a photographic memory, he shoulda kidnapped one. I'm working on it here.

Is there any way you could get into his truck?

We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?

I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick --

I never worked at no casino.

Wish I had a brother like you.

A station wagon in Canada.

Hey.

I said, who the hell made the map?

This is the front entrance, right? You get through the slots, you hit craps here, not blackjack. Blackjack's here to here -- lined up. What's this, the cage? Cage is over there, hard to get to, you got it all mixed around --

Get out.

...never... tried...

I been driving rigs a long time, Nick. Four, five million miles of road. Worked for people who wouldn't keep me on less I was driving fifteen hours a day. Tell 'em I needed sleep, I needed rest, shit, they'll hire someone else...

You guys get caught, I go away for good. I got an interest in making sure you don't. You need a sixth man covering an exit. What're you gonna do about it.

Six men means six guns.

Hey! HEY! THERE IS A POWWOW SAFE!

Was it your plan, Monster? Or was it hers.

How'd you know my name...

How'd you know my name was Rudy.

Get in there and watch 'em. Watch their every fuckin' move.

His personal safe, he gave it a name. Now you're telling me they've taken his office, put the buffet there? Then who knows what else they changed.

Buffet is by the goddamn bar! What the hell kind of map is this?!

Not with you.

He didn't recognize me. Back off, willya? He didn't recognize me.

DROP THE GUNS! NOW!

Merlin, I didn't know --

It's a roach, guy --

Haven't thought about it.

Get to thinking about it, it won't happen.

Not yet.

I'm just talking.

Thought you hated Sidnaw.

Thought you hate your old man.

What, working security?

Alamo...

GUARD!!!

Walk outta there and tell her I was you.

I'm ninety-two years old --

Who the hell made this map.

Since when? What the hell is this room?

Yes.

Fine, now.

No. That your head's been up your ass. I walk through the door and Joe says "Vic, you're back, thank god. Finally somebody who knows what the fuck he's doing. Vic, Vic, Vic, Eddie, my son, is a fuck up." And I say "Well, Joe, I coulda told you that." "I'm ruined! He's ruining me! My son, I love him, but he's taking my business and flushing it down the fuckin' toilet! "  I'm not tellin' tales out of school. You tell 'im Joe. Tell 'im yourself.

No, you'd keep me for yourself. Four years fuckin' punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it.

Was he all pissed off?

How do you know all this?

Nobody did. You assholes turn the jewelry store into a wild west show, and you wonder why cops show up.

I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station.

...What bar?

What about?

He's a cool guy. A real nice, real funny, real cool guy.

What for?

You can do some crazy things with it.

You two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds. We're there for those stones, period. Since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off. We're out of there in two minutes, not one second longer. What if the manager won't give up the diamonds?

Fuckin' asshole, won't let me leave the halfway house.

What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you?

It's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy. Now granted that's what "True Blue" is about, no argument about that.

Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry- fucking-Vale.

Whatever. Just throw in your dollar, and let's move.  See what I'm dealing with here. Infants. I'm fuckin' dealin' with infants.

Jesus Christ, Joe. Fuckin' forget it. This is beneath me. I'm Mr. Pink, let's move on.

Dead as Dillinger.

I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it.

Bad luck. What's the exposure like?

Juicy, junior, real juicy.

Like hell I am.

That's your proof?

Shit. I don't remember that at all.

We think we got a rat in the house.

That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.

Down to my car.

It's a surprise.

No, I'm not!

I'm okay.

Larry, I'm so scared, would you please hold me.

You're not gonna fucking die, all right?

You could've asked the cop, if you didn't just kill him. He talked about what he was going to do when he was slicing him up.

Uh-uh. I don't tip.

Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?

Splash some water on your face. Take a breather.

That's not correct.

Don't tell me your name, I don't want to know! I sure as hell ain't gonna tell ya mine.

Shot my way out. Everybody was shooting, so I just blasted my way outta there.

A few cops.

That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen. Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that?

Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car and Mr. Brown floored it. After that, I don't know what went down.

I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a long time. I can tell ya straight up, Joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit.

Well, first things first, staying here's goofy. We gotta book up.

You gotta idea, spit it out.

Well, he knows a little about me.

I told him my first name, and where I'm from.

Well that's that, then. I mean, I was worried about mug shot possibilities already. But now he knows:  what you look like,  what your first name is,  where you're from and  what your specialty is. They ain't gonna hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out. That's it right, you didn't tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection?

You said yourself, you thought about takin' him out.

Maybe he did.

Maybe you won't feel that way after I tell you what I stopped in for.

But I'm going to have to leave 'em here. They're --- well they're not the sort of people you're used to.

Too much excitement. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?

As far as -- Sonora?

It's a nice place owned by an old couple named Wyatt.

He's learning his letters.

Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?

You're not going out to look for them?

I suppose that's my fault.

You've got to -- don't you understand -- they want me with them and they'll fix it so I have to go --

A man I used to know.

Like what?

I don't want to run short.

Yes.

Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me.

Good thing you didn't.

Sure. You'll find it under the wagon seat. Like I said before, a twenty- two's more your size.

I guess I have. You were pretty little when they locked him up. I don't suppose you even remember that time I was gone two months.

I caught up with Lednov in Nogales. He didn't like the idea of comin' back across the border but he came. I turned him over to the sheriff and -- that's the story.

You better start.

The whole state's lookin' for 'em.  And they're lookin' for me.

All right, you didn't know.

Nobody asked you to.

What's there to be fair about?

I don't care.

He won't take us.  Don't you want us around?

Not if I know Mary. When she rides into Sonora, you'll be with her. And mighty glad to be there after this. I don't see how you stood it as long as you did.

Just a thing I was workin' on.

I knew something would happen when they started puttin' up fences and passin' laws.

Maybe in Sonora.

No we don't. But that's where we're going. From Minden we take a stage to Reno, then another one over to Auburn and another one to Placerville. Then it's a day's trip to Sonora.

Go ahead.  Get in training for the pioneer life. I'm finding the nearest body of water and climbing into it.

Maybe you are. I'm not.

Put on another one.

Don't you even know your letters?

Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.

Then if they wasn't alive, how can they be an animal?...

Oh, sure.

It's a long ways yet.  I figure we ought to camp. She's tired.

Well, we never made it official, so I guess we were technically never really boyfriend and girlfriend, but I was seeing him in school. I saw him at the mall about six months ago and I was too nervous to introduce myself so I followed him to his car, and jotted down the license plate number. It was registered to his mother, so I went to her house. She was so nice. I mean, she seemed like she would be nice 'cuz I never really spoke to her. I just waited til she went to work then I climbed in through her window and borrowed her phone book. I say borrowed because I'm going to give it back one day. But anyway, I called everyone in it til I found her son. He wasn't home when I called so I left this message how much in love I was with him. I was, and how I wanted to have his children. Just really opening up, and he never called back. I'd call and call, and anyway, six months and two restraining orders later I just decided I deserved better. What about you? Do you have a boyfriend?

In room "302" at ten o'clock?

Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.

It would've just been you, if you would've kept your mouth shut.

What?! What is it, a monster?!

Hey, I have an idea...

Ray, have you been here all this time?

I'm fine. Just a few bruises.

Thanks. I'm Cindy.

No. I never date outside my race.

Yeah.

Wait, I want to check something. Give me a hand.

Shit!

Can you feel that?

Then what are we going to do?

That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.

So, whatever happened to her?

But he'll kill her!

It's the sequel.

Thanks. I made them by hand.

Now you'll be mine, Cindy.

Quick, everyone to the lab.

I'll go.

My child, you're alive!

My child you are the only survivor.

Now you gotta learn the correct slang.

Yeah, bitch, give me my apple. What's gotten into you?

Saw who?!

In about fifteen minutes.

Fine.  What's all this stuff?

Just a little experiment.

Oh, I couldn't do that.

Thanks, handyman.

Yours, or the turkeys?

Second best.

I guess so.

My holy water.

Shorty, why don't you say grace?

The "Citizen Kane" of gore movies.

What happened?

It's the influence of all those family films.  Right, Mom?  Hey, Mom??... 

That's right up the street! Come on! Just in case!

Jeeezzz!

It's a cool idea, Misty! Let's make a gore movie about Mom! Better yet, a TV series!

I DO! Mom's gone crazy!

If Mom's a psycho, Scotty will still be ok, won't he?

He certainly drives like a jerk.

Do you have the musical, "Annie"?

Let me see!

I'm so happy I could shit.

Dr. Sutphin is your wife a big reader?

I've identified every little birdie we're going to watch tomorrow on the Eastern Shore.

Ooohhhh!

Ooh, honey, I'm ready! Now! Now!

...People who don't mind their own business.

GODDAMN YOU! THAT'S TRESPASSING!

Mrs. Wilson from the telephone company. I understand you're having problems with obscene calls.

Marvin A. Pickles.

You'll pay for this, Marvin A. Pickles!  I'm turning your file over to the vice-squad!!  The prosecution rests, your honor.

I do, please.

We all have bad nights. 

Mother! Did you hear me?! Someone murdered Carl in the mensroom! I saw his dead body!

I'm not that bad a driver.  Look at her hair!  Turn it off, honey.

I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!

I didn't want that Faberge egg - it was chipped!

That's no excuse for a morbid imagination. I caught him drawing this in class last week.  Is there a problem at home?

From what I understand, the eye- witness is a drug user.

You can?

Why would Mrs. Redi lie to me?

No.

It doesn't matter. You want to now. You should want to. It's your obligation, your duty.

Thank you.

What sort of danger?

For the time being, I imagine that must do.

She's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances.

Hello, Frances.

I don't know. That's why I came to see Mrs. Redi. I'm trying to find her.

I know. For the first time I'm beginning to be frightened. I almost feel as if I'd never known my sister.

I can't understand it at all.

But I like teaching school.

She was just asking about you - Whether it was nice to work for you or not.

Because I loved Jacqueline I thought I knew her. Today I found out such strange things frightening things. I saw a hangman's noose that she had hanging - waiting  I feel as if I'd never known her.

Good.

There is a very simple way. Got a telephone book?

Last night in this very restaurant Mr. Jason Hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear.

Things changed, Mary. The reasons for finding Jacqueline changed. I want to find Jacqueline to settle things.

Any court in the land would understand. We'll wait a few days -- let you rest -- then we'll go to the police.

You'd love that, Jackie. Remember that last summer with Mother in the Berkshires? You used to help the gardener.

You don't even know Jacqueline Gibson.

This is the part of New York I love. It is old. It has memories. If you listen, the houses will speak to you. Walt Whitman...Edna St. Vincent Millay... Eugene O'Neill...in their time they've all lived here.

I don't know.

We could tell him.

And then?

I won't get lonely.

Yes. I was going to tell you to look into your own heart -- do you really want to find your sister?

But you're always at the library.

I don't think that's so revealing.

I'm at sea, Jason.

It's all clear to me now -- so clear.

He's Jacqueline's husband. I can't

We are happy, Mrs. Romari, because you have everything  and I am happy because I have nothing to lose.

I wouldn't want to take them out. I just want to look at them.

But why come to me?

I've lost my knack.

Uhhuh.

Actually I want to ask two favors of you -- one as a poet 	one as a detective.

I should like people to read what I've written.

It might have.

I'd like that.

You know where she is?

Cloven hoof?

I'm very, very serious.

And I love and admire him more than any man I ever knew. I read these poems. He's lost his talent and his was a really great gift. What I have to do today -- to bring him this rejected manuscript -will be the most disheartening thing I have ever done and the most disillusioning.

Mary, I'm amazed. Didn't Jacqueline tell you? She sold the business to me at least eight months ago. It's my business now.

Leave me your address, and if I find anything, I'll get in touch with you.

That's too bad.

I doubt if you'll get anything out of that woman. But if  you'd like to try, I'll advance you the money to make the trip to New York. Of course, my dear, if you don't find your sister, you can always come back here.

Please.

We haven't even begun tea yet.

I know. You introduced Jacqueline to us -- but how could you tell -

Yes, Jacqueline. You were always talking suicide - - of ending your life when you wanted to.

Television?

Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?

Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.

I think so. I remember reading somewhere that men learn to love what they're attracted to, whereas women become more and more attracted to the person they love.

Yeah, actually, I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now.

Agreed.

Impotent.

I am self-conscious, but not in the same way that you are. You have got to be the most attractive self- conscious person I've ever seen.

Well, I wasn't always impotent.

Basically, yes.

That's correct.  Bit of a dilemma, isn't it?

Ann. Hello.

Videotapes.

You went out with her?

Can we look at one?

Everything about sex.

Yes.

Mostly. Sometimes they do things.

Maybe you want to go.

I know.

It's a simple question. Have you ever thought of having -- making love with someone other than your husband?

No.

So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?

Don't you get lonely?

Not yet. I'm not sure I will. I just want out.

I don't know. It all gets back to that Cynthia thing. I don't like her... eagerness. There's nothing left to imagine, there's no...

I'm babbling.

No.

Yeah, you're right. But I never claimed to know everything like you, and have all these little theories. I'm still learning, I know that. But I don't feel like I've wasted time. If I had to go through my marriage to get to where I am right now, fine.

Well, what kind of answer are you looking for, Ann? What is it exactly that you want to know?

I'm okay. It's okay.

Stay away from the Garden District. Serious crime. I don't know what kind of place you're looking for, but there are a lot of studio-type apartments available elsewhere.

I don't, either. I mean, Cynthia, of all people. She's so...

I want out of this marriage.

I'm not going to discuss this with you anymore. You're making no sense.

Yes!

You bitch. I knew it.

Yeah, I know.

Fine, I guess. Except right now I'm going through this where I don't want him to touch me.

Did you masturbate?

Radon leakage?

No, I haven't.

Did you confront John about the visitor?

The friend of John's that was staying at your house.

Is he still at your house?

What do you mean? I don't understand.

I guess.

Why, so you can go after him?

You know what. You say it just to irritate me.

I have a pretty good idea.

What the hell happened over there? Did he make a pass at you?

Oh, so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape, but you won't tell your own sister?

I'm Cynthia Bishop.

Nope.

Sex. Your sexual history, your sexual preferences.

That's all.

That depends on you. One woman only used three minutes. Another filled up three two hour tapes.

He said that my hand felt good.

I can handle it. Besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute. And you are in no position to be jealous.

Cynthia, I don't think you want to, I mean, you should see the way he dresses. I really think he's in a bad way.

She's there? What's she doing there?

It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.

You trust him.

By definition you're lying to Ann, too.

Did he put you up to this?

Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk.

No.  You said three-fifty?

How about for five hundred?

You were prying before?

You know which tapes! Where are they?

So is my wife, asshole!!

Anyway, I've always said, the work is the thing. I can be happy without a marriage, but take away my work, that's different. And if Ann can't handle that, that's her problem, like we re all alone in this world, you know what I'm saying? I mean, fuck.  Jesus, what's takin' this guy?

Yeah.

Okay, in a minute, I'm on with a client.

All right, jesus.

Yes.

How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed?

Far as I know, yeah, that was her.

I think I... I think I killed him. I stabbed him with something and he fell.

What do you want to call me at the office for?

Nick, you're so strange...

I want to be able to see us, Nick. I... I'm going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts, OK? Is that OK?  I want to be able to see us when we make love, OK?

It's Dr. St. Luc, Mr Spergazzi. Let me speak to the nurse, please.

Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?

NIGHT NIGHT

BREAKING OUT

BREAKING OUT

Fools!

As Janet's parents this should be really easy.  Your last clue... Mental Instability.  You have thirty seconds.

Looks like 'Rest Home' for this marriage.

I've caught it once or twice.

It's no use pussyfooting around, Janet -- we have to cut quick and deep.

After breakfast.  You're sounding tense, Janet.  Maybe I could give you a little massage?

WELL FIRST YOU GO RIP RIP RIP THEN YOU GO SNIP SNIP SNIP THEN YOU WHIP IN A ZIP ZIP ZIP AN' YOU SPLIT IT UP TO THE HIP HIP HIP AN' AS YOU STRIP STRIP STRIP YOU QUIVER AND SHIVER FOR THAT SOFT CARESS AS YOU SLIP SLIP SLIP...INTO THAT LITTLE BLACK DRESS

Everyone loves the girl next door, particularly Farley.

No it wasn't Janet -- exactly -- It was, in fact, your new sponsor.

Everything's free there.

Isn't that Brad and Janet Majors sitting down front?  What an ideal couple.

Ah yes.  Farley Flavors.  You know, I find it...

What are you trying to do?  Make Bert look like a fool?  He's made all the arrangements.

SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR THEIR LOVERS

He was adopted you know.

He moved all right!  When they found him with fifteen other naked men at the back of Wilson's Bakery.

Well...maybe I could wear my black leather brogues?

Absolutely correct.

Who?

Thank God he was born an orphan. It would have killed his parents.

You're practically naked!

OUR RAVING SAVIOUR THAT'S YOU!!

Absolutely true.  Compared to all of them, you are perfection, flawless beauty.

Do you really think so?

I'm sick of hearing about that lame dog.  I've got a lot going for me.  I'm going places.  I'm going to be someone.  I'm gonna win my way into the lives and hearts of people even if I have to kill to do it.  I'll make the pathetic little crumbs love me. I don't even know why I'm wasting my time here with you.  I should be with my people...

Arrest that man!  He's committed to our care.

Flavors!

Fast!

YOU'RE NO GOOD

YOU'RE NO GOOD

WHAT A JOKE...

CRIMINAL

We love you, Baby.

Doctor Derek Sommersby? You mean from "One Life to Live"?

I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.

Well, then put him at the singles table.

Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.

Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.

Absolutement.  They have their own label that's just outstanding.

You know me. I love it up here. How about you?

I'm good.

In Santa Ynez.  And I agree with you about Cab Franc.

Oh yeah.

Sure I know Maya. Real well.

You said you had it all lined up.

Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.

You know how long I've been begging to take you on the wine tour. I was beginning to think it was never going to happen.

She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.

I'm working on it.

And Lexapro, yes.

I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish?

Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir.

Now set your glass down and get some air into it.

Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back.

Pour us a couple.

It's going to be great. Here's to us.

She is very hot.

This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara.

Now I've got another lie to live down. Thanks, Jack.

How do you know?

Shut up.

Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.

Is she bringing him to the wedding?

Count me out.

She's been leaving messages here too.

Sure, whatever. Maybe I'll catch a movie.

She's working. I need a break anyway. She's getting a little clingy.  This is our day!

Shut up.

I don't want to talk about it.

He wrote a great one on Burgundy, and I used to get his newsletter, but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting. Plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century, and they turned out to be turkeys. Fucker never retracted.

I know what you need.

Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.

I don't have to.

What's up?

You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.

Yeah.

What?

That's five clicks, Jackson.

No way. No way.

Yeah.

Wasn't supposed to be back till six. Fucker rolls in at five.

I'll pay for it.

Back at you.

Maya, how are you?

Oh, no, actually. Busy night.

Sure.

The Windmill.

A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.

I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.

Not much of a collection really. I haven't had the wallet for that, so I sort of live bottle to bottle. But I've got a couple things I'm saving. I guess the star would be a 1961 Cheval Blanc.

Yeah, I know.

How long have you been into wine?

A paper?

So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?

I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...

My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.

Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped by for a drink. Didn't see you.

Do you know what he's been saying to her?

And I haven't been with anyone since my divorce. This has been a big deal for me, Maya -- hanging out with you, and last night. I really like you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm just his... his freshman roommate from San Diego State.

It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if you even care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did. I think you're great, Maya -- always have. From the first time you waited on me.  And while I'm at it, I guess you should know that my book is not getting published. I thought this one had a chance, but I was wrong. Again. Don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do. So you see I'm not much of a writer. I'm not anything really. The only real talent I seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. We're leaving in the morning, and I want you to know that I take with me wonderful memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

Victoria.

Ken.

I'm going to hang up now, Miles.

Miles, maybe it is better if you don't come to the wedding.

Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate.

Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do?

Not me. I'm not drinking.

This is a tasting, sir. Not a bar.

Quaffable but far from transcendent.

She has a Richebourg? Mon dieu. I have completely underestimated Stephanie.

Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.

He had to make a phone call.

Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't know. Jack and I were supposed to go golfing.

Please tie up Isabelle to the back of the shed. Make sure the knot's tight.

I saw a monster. Can I have a glass of water?

Only for pee or poop.

This one?

This one?

Don't touch him.

My ballet recital.

That's weird.

Who said I was going to die?

I don't feel much.

...I will.

Just make noises then.

Are you going to do this or what?

Bo, can you turn down the volume until Officer Paski leaves?

He's telling you the truth, Edgar. Whoever it was, is very strong and can jump pretty high.

Yes.

We have to go in the basement.

Should we make a run for it out the back?

Got it!

It came on about two hours ago. Woke me up.  We won Graham.

Me too.

Edgar, come inside.

Who wrote this book?

Yes. They would invade us using only ground tactics. Hand to hand combat. They wouldn't use their technology or fight an airborne battle, because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them.

The footprints.

There are none.

What kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without cracking it?

What was the first thing?

Sounds like a virus.

Six months.

It's left its mark still. The last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world. Take them into town. Get their minds -- your mind, on everyday things. It's good medicine.

Yes... That's the first thing Colleen asked too.

What did you say?

Posse? What the hell you talking about?

McKendrick.

Have you thought at all about your plans?

I guess I put a good scare into him.

I just came out to say goodbye.

Yeah, me and Jake will be heading out for California soon.

Yeah... that must have been it.

I already did that.

Looks like that's not all they admired.

Where's Turley?

Going to Turley, was it?

He is that.

I'm going to California with my brother.

She's gone, gone to town. She hated working on the farm...  ...just like you.

The cattle! This valley runs down to a clear creek. That's why we picked this spot, and that's why they don't want us here.

I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.  Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.

Tomorrow we're going to town to straighten that out once and for all. The next day we'll be back here... farming. And these cattle better be gone.

We got married just before this trip, so we could come out here and try the land. It's hard to find a man willing to take on a life like that.

And a pretty lady.

Why?

Half the gunslingers that drift into town turn up on our police force.

His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.

I've got no reason to run. It was a fair fight and there were plenty of witnesses.

We didn't get that far.

He'll be here.

We don't serve them here and you know it. I asked him to leave and he went crazy on us. He owes me money for this damage.

Who did it?

They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through.

Hello, Paden. How ya doing?

Well I'm real happy for you, Cobb. But I think I'll keep looking for mine.

I just got to town.

Luck, I guess.

You didn't tell me you owned a saloon.

Well, thanks, but forget it.

Yeah, maybe I will too.

Thanks. That's what I call it too.

What do you mean?

I am telling the truth.

It sounds like you still have feelings for him.

Hmm... Mike and Ike's.

-- I'll tell you why.  It is because Miss Nicola Anders, supermodel with a SAG card God's gift to cinema, has it written into her contract that all cherry Mike & Ike's be removed from her candy dish along with strict instructions that any room she walks into should have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her three of them opened, that there be a personal jacuzzi within eighty paces of her dressing room, and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first class.

So there's no problem -- I can have the rights, the negative too?

I don't need a star.  All I need is an actor -- I'll reshoot the part, cut out Nicola and replace her with a real actor.  A real leading lady.

Why?  Because she would never show up at something like this.  She's intensely private.

"Forever".

I'll send you her resume.

-- I guarantee she won't gain an once.  She's very disciplined.

What about it?

Which accounts for your percentage.  When do I get to meet this dream?

I'll walk you out.

Simone does not control my destiny.

Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you liked it.

Not now.  She's emotional.  Her mother dies today.  Scene forty-two of "Good For Nothing".  It's not a good time.

Elaine, what are you doing tonight? Would you like to go somewhere -- dinner?

No, of course not!  Why?  Would you care if we were?

Excuse me?  Start?

I suppose I could stay, just until she arrives.

Not quite.

Impossible.

I would rather have you than Simone.  Believe me.

Not if I don't let her.

Hello, is this Elaine?

Just a minute.

I mean really meet her -- in the flesh.

Why?

Of course.

Do what you do to Simone.

Is that a problem?

You never were together, Hal.

Really?  She didn't mention it.

Viktor, Clyde simply has to get close to Simone in this scene!  He has to touch her.  He has to!

Simone!

You do?

You saw that?

You look very grown up.  What are you doing?  You meeting your mom for dinner?

Well, I can't wait to meet Simone... what's her last name?

Is she here tonight?

I know plenty of boys.

You were the one who insisted on it.  Reading me Dostoyevsky and Joyce when I was four.

If anyone asks about Simone --

Night, Lainey.

I love you too, daddy.

No, that was me.

Me and Simone.  What I did.

What?!

This is the story.

I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. I don't want you to be disappointed.  It gets cold out here at night.

It's a yacht.

I wouldn't want you to compromise your ethics.

Don't you?

Maybe he's talking to himself.

Why?

Taller, Viktor.

Yes.

After I saw what Simone did with the role -- you know I fired all my people, went into rehab, took acting classes, changed my whole look.  She really inspired me.

Good.

She's already here.  She arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone.  Remember, under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission.

Buy it?  They're paying for it. And around here that's how you really know they buy it.

You are birth of... what?  A Phenomenon.  A miracle.  A new era in show business.  All I wanted to do was finish the film.

Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom.

We can keep it in the bathroom.

What? You don't see enough of me at the store?

What, Anna? What did I do? What's made you so sad?

They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.

No, just one.

That I'm a freak.

What about Mrs. Marschal?

I don't know, Cole.

It means I wasn't what everyone thought I was...  I was a fake.

What?

You'd cry. Cause you miss grandma so much.

They did?

They scare me too sometimes.

Ghosts.

What?

Cole, please stop.

They used to hang people here.

They'd pull the people in crying and kissing their families bye... People watching would spit at them.

Like what?

You're a stuttering Stanley!

It's our pleasure.

J. C. Penny's?

Meaning?

What are you talking about?

Let's say today, we make it your business.

What's a "little while?"

I ain't never played a banjo in my life.

Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.

Not lately.

Yeah. It's the alternator all right.

You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?

Hell, no. But you missed a damn good sermon. "You can't hide a wicked heart from the eyes of the Lord."

Where's Jack? Anybody seen Jack?

-- "Billy-Jean" --

It harvests! It threshes! Look at these blades.

"-- an AXE!"

Come out, come out wherever you are!

This is his room... isn't it?

I'll be fine here.

Maybe you should tell that to the old lady you tried to hit with the shovel.

-- It's not me!

I --

Not while you're driving.

I'm admiring your costume. What "movie" are you going as again?

Dammit, Karen -- I was just... looking for your pulse.

What's wrong?

Who? Us?!

Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets in my face, he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet.

You got something against farm people, Keith?

Yeah. Sure. I'm screwing up the song. You're the one who's been two beats behind since we kicked it off.

Yeah. That sounds good. "Hang a left at the first cow patty, then make a right when you see porky pig".

Yeah?

Picked up one of those shears. Blade's razor sharp. -- Where is everyone?

Mmmm -- so can I...

HE'S STILL OUT THERE!!!

No. Not without you --

CARL??? Carl did this?!!

Why bother?

Bill, we need to talk!

Touch some deer feces out in the forest. Eat a sandwich without washing your hands. Then you got lyme disease.

Just checking out the lights.

I'll get Wally to show me sometime then.

Bill, I'll run out to your car, call for paramedics from there.

I'm sorry.

Okay.

Just block the doors, any way you can.

What the fuck they gonna do with her in a hospital, Bill?

Listen, you got any reports of... I don't know what you call 'em. They look like big slugs, only fast.

Shit. You're kidding me. Nope. BRENDA Brenda! GRANT Hell, you were --

That's disrespectful.

I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?

Wearing white, just like on our... wedding day. I remember it.

Grant? Why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?

Grant, you're sick!

We ain't never gonna find that girl now.

You know how rumors start.

They're both a challenge.

Yeah, I do. Especially from that angle.

Mattoon, Illinois. But I moved down south to work in the Civil Rights movement.

We're cool. The dumb schmuck took the wrong turn.

You know, you're not a bad passenger.

I don't know. Maybe Jerry Jeff sent the heat after us.

We lost him.

Eleven.

Enough to get to Jersey. I'll walk the rest of the way. I've been sitting a long time.  Nice meeting you. It's been a trip.

You want to lose this putz or not?!?

Nice meeting you, Cledus. Keep on truckin'.

You take the front, I'll take the back.

The minute you see him, you'll know.

Weight Station.

Well, thanks for the lift.

You gotta admire the man's determination.

Because I need your help, sweet thing.  And I need it bad.

You sure do.

Nothing on 'em and two cups of mud; one while I'm waiting.

No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map.

Six. Got it.

Twenty-one is nineteen.

Pull your hammer back, Smokey's coming at you.

What's going on, Bandit? Come on.

What's your twenty?

Not for long, you ain't.

I'll drop off my fare, hit a quick choke-and-puke and be blocking for you pronto.

On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay?

What's your twenty?

I'm at marker eight-five.

I ran into complications.

You okay?

God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.

You're about to hit a convoy. Tighten up your rubber band. The oncoming's clear.

I'm cucumber cool.

Ticking away, but it looks like a clear shot to Hot Town. Green lights and white lines all the way.

Go head on, breaker.

Who's Fred?

Because I wanna see this hot shot Bandit do something that can't be done. Besides, there's nothing I like better than breaking legends.

That's the point, Dickey.

And everybody, all the time. Yeah, it's a chore.

Well, we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras, so--

You have a butler working that floor?

And a very bad gamble.

No. And I want to be in that room a half second after Mecklen calls to say the deal's done. We've got a sheriff's task force on stand-by.

All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move.

Have them mobilized. I'll phone security and have the elevators locked down and stairwells secured. We need to keep Israel sequestered in that penthouse.

Mortal.

Yeah.

Uh, yeah.

Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.

You woulda?

I got it made in the shade Amigo. Hey, I'll see you up here some day, don't worry.

The Teamsters had a reform measure going to ballot that didn't sit too well with the local syndicate. Night of the polling, big black-tie to-do downtown and the Tremor Brothers crash the party. Literally.

That's already happened hoss. It's naive to think otherwise.

Are you a fucking colossal idiot?

Without peer?

-- and you're gonna feel altogether fucked, by me, if you don't handle this. I'm the one, does the face plant, this falls apart, not you.

-- this isn't a swap meet Morrey, they're getting Sparazza and the west coast syndicate, giftwrapped, now if that's not good enough --

They what? What? No. No. Why?

I thought Heller was a double op?

His testimony has the potential of blowing the lid off what's left of the La Cosa Nostra is this country. That alone warrants total immunity from prosecution and and a vanishing act with Witness Protection.

You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?

...He does now...

So all of our intel was bogus to begin with.

The same year that Sparazza murdered Agent Freeman Heller...

-- We needed cohesion to move forward. Not conjecture.

I don't see it like that at all.

-- okay, g'head --

Yeah, y'ain't heard the punchline, yet and before I get to it, one more thing I heard, little curious, should probably bring it up... Primo wants Israel's heart. The actual thing, the organ.

A million flat.

None whatsoever.

Nah, nuthin' on my end --

Well, uh -- damn, alright, so he's headed in, does that -- where does that leave us?

-- good, then all you got to be is grateful.

You do the right thing. Sit with me while I heal, let it develop slow.

A Fed? Like FBI?

You know I burned all his shit. All that vinyl. Chalamar, Funkadelic, I burned his turntables too. They was like three-thousand brand new.

What!?

Damn! Why you trippin' like that?

Security's locking down the elevators.

...What are they doin' right now...?

Jus' keep doin' y'damage girl, keep these mafuckas off my as--

Naw baby, they heard about that Triad hit, the work ya'll put in and they recognize the skills. And this ain't no tryout, tap-dance "show us your shit" thing neither -- if ya'll want this then I'mma go git it for 'ya.

What's the time frame?

I can trust Rheya.

Didn't you talk to Snow?

In the lab.  With her, probably.

Not her.  It.

What?

Shut up.

I wish you'd told me.

Why?

I'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.

I've never heard you express any desire to leave before now.  Why now?

That's right.  And we all have to sleep, eventually.

She drank liquid oxygen.

I want you to get Sartorius to abandon his plan.

I won't be making the trip.

I'll go with you.

You didn't look very happy.

And tonight?

Stop it.

Not exactly.  It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe. An infinite number of them, in fact. It was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the Universe, Space, or Space-Time.  It was completely counter-intuitive.  We had to unlearn everything.

Intelligent beyond our comprehension.

How old were you?

I did too.

It's genetics.  You know this.  You know where it comes from.  There is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires.

I think so.

You don't love me.

Yes.  Especially toward the end.

No.  I love you.

Rheya.

You're lying.  I'm not human.

You exist here.  I keep telling you.

Yes, you are --

A sleeping pill.  Do you want yours?

Shhhh.  Just stay with me.  Stay with me.  Everything is forgiven. Everything.

We want to talk freely.

It's an experiment.

Gibarian was helpless.  It's very simple: Man created the science that resulted in the discovery of Solaris, and the ship that brought us here.

Fuck me.  I knew it.

It's called "solid"... Nice to find someone you can count on, Win.

Hard to find doors in this place.

Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?

Oh... Yes... I don't have it with me.  It's at home.

He thinks you're being a little careless.  He made the point several times.

No, Ma'am.

I got money.

Hey!  There are crazy people here.

How did you know?

Absolutely.  Look at this.

Hey.  This is my business.  Do I tell you your business.

But "nice".

You don't like him, do you?

I'll miss you, Mike...

Let go!

Not exactly.

Oh that thing in Queens.

Yeah.

I know.

You take care.

Just putting in an appearance then.

... I don't want to talk about it...

Sure we are, let's go!

I'm all right.

Too kinky.

What?

I can still use a gun.

Unbelievably handsome.  You look fantastic in a suit.

Why?

Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.

I'll be right up.

Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw it coming.

D'you have to say "fucking" every other word?

I just sat and listened.

Discourage it.  But stay with her if you can't.  Call it in first so we can have a car on tail.  She's agreed to travel only with her own driver and limousine... okay, let's check it out.

I can't do it, you know that... He's not gonna allow it anyway, Mike.  No way is he gonna let anybody walk out of that house alive, who can finger him.

Ever shot anyone?

No, sir...

That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...

She trusts me.  She'll do what I say.

Koontz!  Let her come in!  Claire! It's pitch dark in here!  You're gonna have trouble seeing anything, so just come in, and straight down a long hall.  Then stand at the door so we can see you. We want to see your face and we won't be able to until you get to the kitchen door!

I get my hostage first.  No one's turned loose until I say so.

What the fuck you doin'?!

Yeah, I think so.

Mom and I got plans.

So, what are you doing tonight?

Shooting?

Peter Parker, you have no idea what I did this weekend.  Or didn't do. It's no business of yours either way.

You stop him?

I was sort of hoping to get out of--

Hm.  What a lump.

Come on, laughter's the best medicine!

You're not half the idiot I am, Harry.

Well, I've missed a lot of classes myself...

Right.

Frmpph-yrr.

A spider.  Eight legs.

Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.

Just about.  You see, I also have this amazing strength...

Just about.  See, I also have this amazing strength.

I hate your relatives, I hate your coffee, I hate your shoes.

No, it wasn't only you-- it -- it just wasn't my style.  Hey, look-- let's go to lunch.  Someplace nice for a change.

That was then.  I'm better since the lobotomy.

So?  The next day I'd read, "Peter Parker murdered," and I'd feel...

Unh-huh.  Excuse me.  I've gotta go.

Hello.  So very boring.  Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning?

Nah.

So you've found Thorkel?

Einstein, right?  We'll see ya.

Precise equipment such as waldos

--but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.

Funny thing happened after my physics class today. Harry Osborn--

It's fine.  Tell me what--

I mean, I suddenly have immense physical power, and the ability to crawl up walls--

I've had an extremely bad day, Octavius.  A sophomoric prank in the library and punitive measures.

Hi, Professor.  What's up?

An extension on that astronomy paper?  Because, uh...

Actually, I got this spider bite

I don't think I'll be running into him.

Letterman show, NBC. We'll talk then.  Bye.

Yup.  Oh, here's your check, minus my commission.  Solid, solid novelty act.

And blow up the universe just to prove he's right?  Bit egotistical, isn't it?

Just drop me off here.

No, but I've got this secret identity to worry about. I'll swing the rest of the way.

No, no!  Not there!

You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.

There was that ammunition train in the depot at Frankfurt, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room and fixes a time bomb, see? Then he waits until the train starts moving out, see? And one of the cars got the door open with some straw on the floor, see? So he throws it, see, and three minutes later -- voom! See?

Just pulled the old match gag, see!

Take some matches, see?  And a cigarette, see?  Tuck the cigarette in like this, see?  Now the cigarette keeps burning like a fuse, see?

Don't worry. He'll be all right.

I don't know anymore.

Who is it?

So long, Sefton.

A lot sharper, Sefton! I'd like to have some of that loot you got in those footlockers!

You stink, Sefton!

That's right.

Why not?

Yes, it would. Do we know each other?

Not you.

Yeah.

I didn't do it. I didn't do it.

Sprechen Sie deutsch?

Raus! Raus! All of you!

Let me go!

Me? What if she don't want me?

No?

Sharp. Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening.

This is a good one!  Shut up, everybody! Listen to this!  'The President of the United States to Harry Shapiro. Greeting: Having submitted yourself to a local board, you are hereby notified to report...' What do you know! So now I'm a draft evader!

Come on, you little stooge. Hand over them keys.

Let me alone.

You want to go?

Yes, Sergeant Hoffman?

Yes, sir.

Kill it, Duke. It's got us all spinning.

Wait a second, Hoffy. Schulz says he's our best friend. Maybe he can give us a little hint.

The guy I want to talk to is Sefton. Where's Sefton?  You haven't seen Sefton, have you?

Yeah? How would you like to see the guts of nine pals splattered all over your plane?  C'mon Joey -- don't be afraid.

One more thing, gentlemen. The Kommandant told me to pick up the radio.

Come on, everybody!  Let's go!

Go on, Sefton -- butt out!

Are we boring you?

It adds up that you got yourselves the wrong guy. Because I'm telling you. The Krauts wouldn't plant two stoolies in one barrack. And whatever you do to me you're going to have to do all over again when you find the right guy.

Okay, then. Put a guard on me. I want you to put a guard on me. Because if anything goes wrong out there, this time you won't have a patsy. Right?

Don't you know? Because I got my own ideas.  Let's have that civilian stuff.

Give this to Joey, will you?

They know about that gadget. I'd worry more about the radio.

Suppose you just sit down and keep your mouth shut.

Yes, I'm from Cleveland.

Where. Up Joey's ocarina. Didn't you know?

The one you took out of the corner of your bunk and put in this pocket.

Give me the radio.

Who's the guy, Schulz?

Yes, you do!

Not particularly.

Look at them, Lieutenant. Everybody is a clown! How do you expect to win the war with an army of clowns?

Oh! Somebody was peeking!

Maybe those Russian dames would take him.

I don't know. He bathed, now he is roaming the ship. He must be the only Engineer in Starfleet who does not go to Engineering!

When is it expected back?

It will take a few moments for the computer to compile the information.

But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?

Guilt. It is a most unpleasant feeling.

Commander.

It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.

I know. I just got it.  It was very funny.

The ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5. Distance: three light years.

Soran doesn't care about power or weapons. All he cares about is getting back to the Nexus.

What happened to you?

You're in the Nexus.

Why would you want to leave?

It's our pleasure.

Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of-

That's right.

It's like you always said- if something's important enough, you make the time.

There's just no way to disrupt a gravimetric field of this magnitude!

I thought you might.

A photon torpedo?

Load torpedo bays, prepare to fire on my command.

Captain, I don't know how much longer I can hold her together!

What's normal?

No.

Guinan? I don't know what you're talking about.

Yeah, they're full of great ideas.

I told you everything. You might as well just kill me right now.

When we went to ancient Rome for Deanna's promotion, we threw her to the lions, remember?

You want me to contact Starfleet?

A quantum implosion has occurred within the Amargosa star. All nuclearfusion is breaking down.

Too big. How long until the ribbon arrives?

Actually, I'm here to see if there's anything I can do for you.

Yes, yes, Captain. Thank you for coming.

Well, that narrows it to Klingon, Breen or Romulan.

Why were they looking for it on a Federation observatory? It doesn't make any sense.

Aye, sir.

Lursa and B'Etor? This doesn't make any sense. A renowned stellar physicist somehow uses a trilithium probe to destroy a star, kidnaps Geordi and escapes with a pair of Klingon renegades. Why? What the hell's going on?

If he tries to get away with Warp Drive, he's really in for a shock...

Execute!

An energy reading from 'C" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters...

Yes. He has a long journey ahead.

Sir, Starfleet calling Grissom again. A warning about us.

Nothing. As before.

Aye, sir.

Scotty...?

Wait a minute...! We don't know what we're talking about here...

What is it?

Thank you... <u>Sir</u>!

... Fascinating.

You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.

Underground deposit?

A photon tube...!

... Or <u>who</u>.

David --

Grissom, your message acknowledged. Will advise... Out.

Not exactly.

My mother knew nothing about it. That's why I asked her to leave Genesis in my hands.

I'll try to remember that, Captain.

I know, but -- let's do it by the book. Stand by on this channel.  Go.

Your reputation is secure, Scotty.  Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'll be in my quarters.

They've knocked out the damn automation center.  I've got no control over anything!

Saavik... Is... David with you?

What? What are you saying?

Yes. And I know you.

Mr. Scott: as good as your word.

Yes, sir. It's getting larger as we close in.

Go, Sulu!

That's the good news. He's home in bed, full of tranquilizers, and he promised me he'd <U>stay</U> there... They say it's exhaustion...  We'll see.

Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage --

Then let me speak to the Council! Harry, <U>please</U>! I can <U>make</U> them understand!!

Of course... Now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away.

Who is this?! How dare you --

Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk.

If we don't help each other, we'll all die here!

I will speak with you alone, Kirk.

Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.

One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.

You will find a way, Kirk. If you honor them both, you <U>must</U>.

I am not sure. Only time will answer.  Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is --

Success, my lord.

Yes, my lord!

This isn't reality. This is fantasy.

I was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications, Doctor. As a matter of cosmic history, it has always been easier to destroy than to create --

'Beware Romulans bearing gifts.' Happy Birthday...

I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring...

Bones, I don't want to be lectured.

I'm your doctor and I'm your friend, Jim. Get back your command. Get it back before you really do grow old. Before you turn into part of this collection.

I have my orders.

Message breaking up, Carol. What's wrong? What's wrong?

Repeat... what's wrong? What's wrong?

What order? Who's taking Genesis?

And I'll wager he never told you about his shipmate, the beautiful and courageous Lieutenant McGiver, who gave up everything to join me in exile. OUT OF LOVE. And see how <u>Admiral Kirk</u> requited her devotion -- She's dead as earth!

Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information?

What?

Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.

The Admiral's son.

It's not much different from Enterprise.  When I was a guest aboard her some years ago, Captain Kirk kindly allowed me to memorize her technical manuals. And now, Mr. Chekov, let us review: You say you have no details of Project 'Genesis' ?

Rake her.

I give you sixty seconds, Admiral.

I've given you no word to keep, Admiral. In my judgment, you simply have no alternative.

Listen to me -- you men and women --

All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis...

Uhura, send to Commander, Reliant: prepare to be boarded.

Spock?

Scotty, let's have it.

Sensors, Captain?

We'll beam aboard. Alert transporter room --

All right, we'll do the job with auxiliary power.

Admiral, if we go by the book, like Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem like days.

I am understandably curious.

To be sure, Captain.

Like all living beings, Admiral each according to his gifts. The ship is yours.

I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well.  Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material.

How far?

Visual!  Mr. Sulu, divert everything to the phasers --

Wait for my signal, Spock -- too soon and he'll have time to figure it out and raise them again.

... Blind as a Tiberian Bat. What do you make of the plantoid beyond?

Aye sir --

Best we could do in two hours.

Or the one.

Spock...!

Sir -- we won't leave you behind...!

Prayer, Mr. Saavik. The Klingons do not take prisoners.  Captain.

... No, sir. It has not.

You're bothered by your performance on the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>.

You may ask, Lieutenant.

HURRY.

They just don't want us going in there.

Aye, sir.

Two minutes, ten seconds.

Good, I believe you already know my, uh, son --

Aye, sir --

I am delighted; any chance to go aboard Enterprise, however briefly, is always an excuse for nostalgia.

Thank you, sir. I've looked forward to this for a long time.

Scotty!

<u>I did nothing</u> -- except get caught with my britches down. I must be senile. Mr. Saavik, you just keep right on quoting regulations. Meantime, let's find out what the hell is going on and see how bad we've been --

I'm aware of my responsibilities, Mister.

Inform the Klingons we are on a rescue mission...

Aye, sir.

By the book...

Spock... The retraining of your mind has been in the Vulcan way, so you may not understand feelings. But as my son, you have them. They will surface.

Where must you go?

Then you stand here alive because of a mistake -- made by your flawed, feeling, human friends. They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the <u>one</u> -- you -- was more important to them.

Yeah.

Not at all. You gave me things to think about. You always do. You do sound a little wrecked, why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling?

I tried to clear things up, Professor Scott. I explained you'd come all the way from Edinburgh on appointment to study manufacturing methods here at Plexico, but they don't seem to know anything about it.

Please...

What do you mean?

Mr. Sulu... Take us home...

We've done it before.

Pavel, can you hear me? Give me your name and rank...

Not me, Bones... They did it.

I did not have time on Vulcan to review the Philosophical disciplines.

It would be impossible to discuss the subject without a common frame of reference.

That is what I said, Doctor.

"Guessing" is not in my nature...

Captain... All systems have failed... We are functioning on reserve power only.

Like what?

All right. Let's take it from the top.

I'm impressed, Mr. Chekov. A lot of effort for a short voyage.

Most prudent.  Engine room. Report, Scotty.

We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand...

Communicate? Communicate what? You have no right to be here!

To put it mildly. Since the dawn of time, men have harvested whales for a variety of purposes, most of which can be achieved synthetically at this point. A hundred years ago, using hand-thrown harpoons, they did plenty of damage -- but that was nothing compared to what they've achieved in this century.

Don't mention it. And don't try anything, either. I got a tire iron right where I can get at it.

Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?

A landlubber. Come on, what the hell were you boys really trying to do back there? Was it some kinda macho thing? If that's all, I'm gonna be real disappointed. I hate that macho type.

Go ahead.

What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances.

See, yes. But we'll tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them.

Then tell me when the whales are leaving.

You asked.  Now, will you tell me something?  George and Gracie's transmitter. What's the frequency?

But Kirk...

What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.

What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...

Why does it have to be goodbye?

That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.

In progress, Admiral.

But you said toxic.

Yes.

Ah... The giants.

Right.  Will you help us?

Hardly, Admiral, I cannot even guarantee we will escape the Sun's gravity! I will attempt to compensate by altering our trajectory.

Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed!

Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero.

Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.

Picture, Uhura!

Aye, sir!

Nothing... I should never have left him...

Bearing 327, range 600 nautical.

Out of control, and blind as a bat!

Scotty, don't prejudge. A ship is a ship.

Yes, Admiral.  Sir. I have not had the opportunity to tell you about your son.  David died most bravely. He saved Spock. He saved us all... I thought you should know.

Klingon justice is a unique point of view, Mr. President.

That's easy: 6 inches. We carry stuff that big in stock.

Just use the keyboard...

It is not an effort. You are my son.  Besides; I am most impressed with your performance in this -- crises.

Tell her I feel fine...

Sulu Hikaru.

Why?

To move you off this planet. You go to sleep one night in your village... wake up the next morning in this flying holodeck transported en masse. A week later, maybe a month, you've been relocated on a similar planet without ever realizing it.

More questions. Always the explorer. If you stay long enough, that'll change.

It took us centuries to learn that it doesn't have to take centuries to learn.

There are caves in those mountains.

This way!

I'll be here.

I understand.

My power cells continually re- charge themselves.

Your Captain used to cut quite a rug...

They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.

Yes. But look at this medscan...

Is it safe to move her?

From the mission...

What you're seeing is a computer driven image created by photons and forcefields...

Will the structure hold if we blast through?

I prefer to wait until we can share the benefits with all the people of the Federation...

I know what Data means to Starfleet, Jean-Luc... but our crew is at the mercy of those people on the planet...

I'll need all your paperwork tomorrow. We're heading back your way. Set a course to rendezvous with us so you can transfer the crew and equipment on your way out.

Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?

Someone probably said the same thing about the Romulans a century ago.

There are metaphasic particles all over The Briar Patch. Why must this planet be...

Delay the procedure. Let my people look at the technology.

Then the Son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do...

The Ba'ku.

Scan for lifesigns.

No, sir. But it wasn't easy... being among them...

Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface.  It appeared to be the Captain's Yacht. Five persons on board.

Negative. I want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can...

On screen.

We can't delay the archaeological expedition to Hanoran Two. It would put us into the middle of monsoon season...

We won't be able to go any faster than one-third impulse in that muck...

Yes... yes, I... can hear you...

We're coming as fast as we can... we can't risk using phasers...

Sir?

No, sir. I haven't had a chance to meet all the new crew members since I've been back...

No, sir. It is a gorch.

We have to find shelter...

And have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up?

Activating injector assembly.

All ship functions are off-line.

They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.

It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.

Let's hope so. Because if Cochrane dies... the future may die with him.

How did Doctor Almack react to that?

You want some advice? Don't do this again.  You know exactly what I mean.

I'd call them excuses. And the first excuse on both our lists was our "sense of duty." We convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else. And you know what? It's not.

Bring us about. Target Borg ship alpha four, port side battery.

Ready quantum torpedo.

I told you, there's no --

Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?

Always am.

It'll have to wait. Come on.

Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...

There's a red light on the second intake valve.

As they used to say... all systems are go.

Well, I feel a whole lot better with them out there. We may need some help.

I think he was running a test on an old rocket engine... and one of the fuel cells burst.

The invasion plans.

Wrong answer, Mister Picard. Try again.

And you know all this... because <U>you're</U> a space-man too...

Yes, he is.

We're trying to repair Doctor Cochrane's ship. It's been damaged and --

Some.

A key piece of the ship has been destroyed... and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like.

We have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon.

And all I'm asking for is the truth. That would take five minutes.  For all I know, you caused the explosions at the silo... and now you're trying to steal Zephram's ship.

No. It's a lot further than that.

Population... thirty-five billion...  All Borg.

Aye, sir.

Data, set a course for that vortex.

Go to manual.

Fire!

They did it... they assimilated Earth.

Yes, sir.

What?

It appears that someone has taken over the Environmental Control Room.

We have to cover both possibilities.  We'll take care of the Bridge. Worf, take your men and seal off Main Engineering. Turn it into a fortress -- nothing gets in.

Agreed. Options?

I'll keep that in mind.

Understood!

We just lost main power... and we've got Class-Three alerts all over the ship. I'm not sure what's --

The Borg.  Some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship.  Seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields.

Do we have any idea how many Borg we're dealing with?

Something is very wrong, Commander. We're falling back.

Captain, I've scanned the planet. The atmosphere contains a high concentration of methane, carbon monoxide and fluorine. The oceans have been chemically altered, as well.

What kind of message?

The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be, Mr. President.

I'm going too. They may need a doctor.

You may need assistance, doctor...

I wish I knew. Uhura?

Can you - ?

What's the Brotherhood of Aliens?

Uh uh. Somebody felt much worse. And I'm starting to understand why.

Starfleet's killed an awful lot of natural phenomena in the name of "exploration"...

Now there's a poser.

In space, no one can hear you sweat.

You say you are due for retirement. May I ask: do your hands shake?

The Chancellor herself will testify that the defendant's hands shook.

I don't mind. Smuggling. Guilty. I come from Arc. Smuggling is an ancient and respected trade there.

I beg your pardon?

Yes.

Well, I -

I am.

Who else?

She's only a cog in the wheel - no way she knows that.

They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.

Mr. Valtane, any more data?

We must do this again soon.

I like it here...

Except us.

Candidate for what?

Aye, sir.

Right standard rudder, Z plus five degrees...

Captain.

Sulu!

Thank you, Captain Sulu.

We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon ship that's bringing Chancellor Gorkon here, and escort him safely through Federation space.

I was asked by my father to open neg-

We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.

I was PREJUDUCED by those achievements.

Spock, you want to know something?

... is to trust him.

Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.

Nothing, Captain. If they're here, they're rigger for silent running.

Commander Uhura has been experiencing technical difficulties sir.

We've got a crew of three hundred turning their own quarters inside out,  but the killers may be among them. Surely they've disposed of these boots by now. Wouldn't it have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?

I'm having the garbage searched. If my surmise is correct these boots will cling to the killers' necks like Tiberian bats. They couldn't make their escape without them; nor can they simply throw them out a window for all to see; no - they're here. Somewhere.

We are experiencing a technical malfunction. All backup systems inoperative.

I do not think so. Enterprise has disobeyed orders and harbors two escaped convicts. Admiral Donald will make certain all your ship-to- shore transmissions are jammed.

What?

Fifty-four planets - and their gaseous atmospheric anomalies. Our sensing and analytic equipment worked well.

What's left of it.

Yet the data banks insist we fired: twice. One computer is lying.

Nevertheless.

I know precisely where he'll be.

There was an enormous neutron energy surge.

If another ship had been beneath us the Klingons would've seen her!

This one can.

Thank you, Mr. Scott. We were to return to spacedock, the killers would surely manage to dispose of their incriminating footwear.

Even assuming you're correct, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own President?

Mr. Scott, any progress on repairing our warp drive?

But you didn't join a conspiracy.

I was taken from my homeworld by people called the "PakJeds." They are fat. They traded me to a ship belonging to the "Bolians." The "Bolians" are blue. They put me in a seat and asked me questions. Then they were attacked by another ship...

I am in a room with lights.

Because you are dangerous.

You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.

No. Can I move now?

It'll serve you right.

Understood. Keep on it. I need to know what he has and how to neutralize any threat. Give me options.

You're working late.

I can see that.

I do not agree. Although you share the same genetic structure, the events of your life have created unique individual.

No, sir, it is not possible. The B-9 is physically identical to me, although his neural pathways are not as advanced. But even if they were, he would not be me.

I aspire, sir. To be better than I am. The B-9 does not. Nor does Shinzon.

It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?

You are not looking at your- self. You are looking at me.

An individual more like you, you mean.

With pleasure, Captain.

You're speaking of emotional investment?

Make it so.

No!

This isn't real.

When this is over, I owe you a drink.

What do we know about the population?

Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready.

Aye, sir.

A diplomatic mission. We've been invited, believe it or not. Seems there's been some kind of internal political shakeup. The new Praetor, someone called Shinzon, has requested a Federation envoy.

Understood.

That will never happen.

Not yet, Mister Worf.

Fifty-two disruptor banks, twenty-seven photon torpedo bays, primary and secondary phased shields.

On screen.

Your new chair, sir.

I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try out the Argo.

It's an old psychological strategy, Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.

She's a predator.

Away team. Transporter room four.

She's the most beautiful ship Ive ever seen.

When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.

I've never met a human woman.

Yes.

You'll acquire a taste for it.

You're doing this to liberate the Remans?

There's so much, and so much of it is dull...

There is that.

I'm honored to think I might someday speak with such eloquence.

In time.

You're not Reman.

I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.

If your issues are with me... This has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the Federation.

Why are you here?

And what of the Enterprise?

Long ago.

Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.

He is what his life has made him!

It is... invigorating.

Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi, get those shields online.

My time. I'll spend it how I choose.

Find her again.

Have the doctors prepare. I'll be on the bridge.'

Seven minutes.

Silence, Romulan!

And mine is wearing thin, young man! We supported you because you promised action. And yet you delay and you waste your time playing games with Picard while--

I don't want to scare them away.

Fill this out.  Will this be cash or credit card?

I'll have to run your card off now.

I understand.

Thank you.

Major Bell here, sir. We have to tell these people that we're friendly. That this whole thing was a mistake. Is anyone trying to contact the ship?

It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes.

They must have picked it up in space.

There's no mistake? You're absolutely sure?

I'm going to the White House right now. I'll try and get you everything you need.

What do you mean by 'contain?'

We've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this time.

It's made itself look like the woman's dead husband.

Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?

I'm gonna be here if you need anything.

I'll make this as simple as I can, George. They disappeared.

You're not hearing me.

You're a career intelligence officer, Shermin. You'll be in the air with us.

I'm afraid we can't let you go.

What?

Shermin!! Shermin!!!

This is George Fox...

Watch it. They're coming out.

I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.

Which way do you want to go?

Pancakes.

Yes.

Gas good?

Not what. Who. What is for things.  What? What? What? What? For people you use who. Who is he?  Who is she?  Who are you?  Who am I?

Closed.

No. I don't know what you are, but you're not Scott.

A drink.

This stuff could kill...  Be my guest.

Shit!

You better.

I do not understand.

Why?

'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'

But I speak English.

I do not speak English.

Yes.

Can I have the gun?

Yes.

No. My ship was doing a map of all the suns and...

We told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. Just to look from up there. We came and... the driver of my ship...

I do not want to.

No. Get in.

The police are waiting for you up ahead. There's a roadblock. You have to go back.

Come on.

You promised you would get me to my ship.

I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.

Nothing.

Yes, they are.

What for?

You say you love me and kiss me 'goodbye.'

You could have killed us both!!

Call the police!!

My grandmother's rich.

This is going to be a real drag. I thought you wanted to go fast.

Pull over. I've got to get back there.

Bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.

We're ready.

Bullshit!

Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.

Wait'll you see it.

Yes.

It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?

No problem.

You're too goddamned paranoid.

I know.  I don't always do exactly what I'm told.  So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?'  And you said -- come on Max.

No, Lenny.

Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just answer one question.  Is anything wrong?  Iris said you might be in trouble.

Tonight.

Why don't you just split?  You don't love him, anybody can see that.  And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.

Damn right.

Can't do it.

I have a gun.  It's under my bed.

A virgin brain!  Well we're going to start you off right.  So what do you know about this?  Save us some time...

It's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle.

Yup.  So darn lucky.  I wake up with a .22-short floating in my brainpan, and a cop pension I can't live off of.  Good thing I wasn't any luckier.  Bobby!  Another shooter right here!

Hey, Iris, you okay?

Why me?

All I'm saying... you don't know how high up the food chain this thing goes.  I've heard stuff.

Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.

Jesus!

And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.

Naawww.

What clip?  What was it?

Uh huh.  Look, Nero.  I'll make you an offer.  Take her.  Right now.  If she wants to go, if she's unhappy here, she can go.  I'll let her choose.  Faith always knows what she wants.  Hands off.  See?

Mace!  You're a life-saver.

Way I look at it, I actually perform a humanitarian service.  I save lives.

She still loves me.

You'll see.

Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her.

Wants to share.

Because Iris knew somebody was after her.

So the guy's not a sicko.

Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?

No shit.  You got someplace in mind?

The gas tank's going to go any second!

Fire's out, isn't it?

You know what this tape could do if it gets out.

I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.

Why didn't he just go public with the tape?  Save himself that way.

I'm not going.

It didn't stop you from loving them. Right?  Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...

Good, Lenny.  I can see why the detective gig didn't work out.  Come on.

And do what?  Take on his whole posse?

A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!

Naw.  They just have to ask us a few questions... for about six hours.

See you downtown.

Are you going to make me beg?

Yup.  He was Jeriko's manager.  Bummer, Tran!  Lost your golden goose.  Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.

Zorro. Yes, ran it through my files, even asked around: came up completely blank. Thought there might be a Mexico connection, El Paso and all, but nothing. Fooled around with the letter "Z," turned it on it's side, got "N" -- there Ng, he's Vietnamese. The only thing that came to mind was zero, not Zorro. Remember Suspect Zero?

Of course. He knows everything about Dick Low.

Takes four days to chill, then its time to come back.  Is that...?

I'm babysitting the DEA guys this afternoon, Casio and I. You said that was top priority.

Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.

Well, the victim was killed at the turn-around over there, then his car was pushed over here...  ...right across the state line. That makes it Federal. This is Officer Wallace, he's out of Alamogordo.

You're thinking...?

Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan.

That's the thing. Don't know if it connects, but Harold here had a thing about eyes. Two of the victims had their eyes gouged out, another punctured. Took polaroids after.

You must travel a lot, huh?

I didn't wait on him. Fifty or so, white, regular build, needed a shave -- that's all I remember.

At the field office.

Just hospital talk. Nothing that connects to Speck.

Just an observer.

What?

I was lucky to find, much less crack, the address code -- no way to be sure I could have done it again.

Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.

I spoke with Lloyd Daitz.

How long ago?

Collected shoes too?

I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.

Thank you, Rangers.  Put this man in the unmarked.

You better hope the Director doesn't stop abruptly one day, David, you might break your nose.

Suspect Zero, now there's an idea that doesn't look good on paper --

Shut the fuck up or I'll shut you up.

They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.

Maybe I shouldn't put it that way. I'm on my best behavior. I've got to watch what I say.

The Academy, then CIIAC.

The other reason?

I was going to be a physician, I am a physician, but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.

Huh?

Not about coming to see Daitz?

I can't. They trust me, they accept me. I've got their confidence.

Oh.

What's up?

You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you.

Koessler doesn't know any of this?

But it was your idea: "use Zero," you said, use Zero to get Low.

How are we going to find him?

Sit back.

I want to protect the boy. I also want to protect Suspect Zero -- from you.

No weapon.

I'll give you a little hint. You're a smart guy, figure it out.

The file, however, was kept open after your death. NPE disappearances, No Plausible Explanation, were sometimes filed there, deleted if the bodies were found.

Zero killed them all?

Who told you about her?

[Hello, Agent Mackelway. How's the watch? Maybe you can do one of those TV commercials, I found my watch under a serial killer's heart and it was still ticking.]

What did you do to end up here?

I like working for the Bureau, sir. I like catching bad guys. It's all I care about.

MyDick. As in my dick. That was his screen name.

Brilliant? You think he caught any of them because he was brilliant? Hardboy? MyDick? Imelda? Ripper? Think about it, how did he locate them?  He found them as Murman. And how did Murder Man find them? With sweet talk and brains? No. He did it with souvenirs. He took them into private rooms, swapped goodies: pictures, panties, jewelry, body parts. Snuff downloads. As bait. That's why I never exchanged with him. He killed girls, oh yeah, harvested them. He had the best stuff. Richard Low is Murman and Murman is one of us.

It's over for you.

I don't know about that.

It didn't feel that way.

No. Stop, come on.

You're money, baby.

What kind of car do you drive?

I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. Let me make it up to you.

What's that like?

Yes! Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager?

I'd say about two weeks.

You better pay the man.

Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.

Why? You're not a real man?

Just like that?

It's been six months and I'm just starting to get over it.

Well, it still sucks, but you start to see that there are advantages to being single.

Uh, if the guy wants to.

I don't even tell them about anything I'm close on anymore...

...Four days..?

I'm a "Dorothy".

...And she's with someone else.

Could you believe it?

Nah, I didn't really want it anyway. I just wanted to order it.

No...

There are different circuits... it's hard to explain... you wouldn't understand...

Why not?

We were a rebound, and we lasted six years.

Sure, I guess. The phone's in the back.

...Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into...

I can call back...

What kind of things?

I thought you met someone else.

I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?

Goodbye. I lov... 

It sucks.

Thanks. Thanks, man.

What do you want? You're tall.

Well, until now. Tend the pin.

I do. Good for you, man.

I don't know. Eight or Nine.

It's one of these. For some reason, cool bars in L.A. have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front.

He's a mean dude. I've seen him smash a guy's face into the curb. He knocked out his teeth... blood... He was just like Boom, Boom, Boom... fuckin nasty shit, man. He's a nice guy though.

You're a better man than I am, Charlie Brown.

I'll be your winger.

At least you didn't get turned down for Goofy...

I didn't make it...

Give me the money. I'll get it.

Not well.

She didn't like me... I made a fool of myself...

Hi, Nikki. This is Mike. I met you tonight at the Dresden. I, uh, just called to say I, uh, I'm really glad we met and you should give me a call. So call me tomorrow, or, like, in two days, whatever. My number is 213- 555-4679... 

213-555-4679. That's all. I just wanted to leave my number. I don't want you to think I'm weird, or desperate or something...  ...I mean, you know, we should just hang out. That's it. No expectations. Just, you know, hang out. Bye. 

I just got out of a six-year relationship. Okay? That should help to explain why I'm acting so weird. It's not you. It's me. I just wanted to say that. Sorry.  This is Mike. 

Hang on, Voltaire.

Just bring your card. Half an hour.

Be downstairs. You're beautiful.

Vegas.

Whu?

Did she, or did she not smile?

We're gonna get laid, baby.

Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop?

You gotta get that girl out of your head. It's time to move on. You're a stylish, successful, good looking cat. The ladies want to love you, you just gotta let them.

That's what I'm telling you, baby. The babies love that stuff. They don't want all that sensitive shit. You start talking to them about puppy dogs and ice cream. They know what you want. What do you think? You think they don't?

Hello, Lisa. I'm Trent. What a lovely makeup job.

Well... we're not in Kansas anymore.

Yes!

What?

Baby, you'll check them tomorrow.

Don't worry about me, baby. I just wanted you to have a good time.

I didn't even like her, to be honest.

She thought you were money.

I heard them talking. They both thought you were money.

Baby, you take yourself out of the game. You start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream, of course it's gonna be on the friend tip.

Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.

See? And what does this guy she's with do?

...through the kitchen...

Don't sweat it, baby. This one's a lay-up.

I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.

What a surprise.

A day.

No...

...How novel.

No.

True.

Now go over there and get those digits.

Now when you talk to her, I don't want you to be the guy in the PG-13 movie that everyone's pulling for. I want you to be the guy in the rated R movie who you're not sure if you like.

Yeah, but three days is kinda the money...

Don't listen to him. You call whenever it feels right to you.

What'd you want me to do? Back down? He called me a bitch. We kept our rep.

Our little baby's growing up...

You owe the Don a service.  In one hour, not before, perhaps later, he will be at your funeral parlor to ask for your help.  Be there to greet him.  If you have any objections speak now, and I'll inform him.

Yes. 

Good.  From me you'll get Justice.

Like hell I will.

How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?

You won't see Paulie anymore.  He's sick for good this winter.

Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?

Sure.

Drive while you thinking; I wanna get to the City this month!

Why do you come to me?  Why do I deserve your generosity?

And what is the percentage of the Tattaglia family?

Are you worried about security for your million?

Can I do something for you still? You're not too rich, or too famous that I can't help you?

He owns the studio.  Just a month ago he bought the movie rights to this book, a best seller.  And the main character is a guy just like me.  I wouldn't even have to act, just be myself.

The Senator called--apologized for not coming personally, but said you'd understand.  Also, some of the Judges...they've all sent gifts. And another call from Virgil Sollozzo.

On a day like this.  Consiglero, do you also have in your notes the the Turk made his living from Prostitution before the war, like the Tattaglias do now.  Write that down before you forget it.  The Turk will wait.

They'll cut the cake in a few minutes...leave right after that. Your new son-in-law, do we give him something important?

Barzini.

I fought for my country.  It was my choice.

No.

A man has to choose what he will be. I believe that.

I'll need him.

Yes.

Even so, I don't think it is safe here anymore.  I've made plans to move you to a villa near Siracuse. You must go right away.

Shhhhh.

This one could seduce the devil.  A body! and eyes as big and black as olives.

That's for you to find out.

Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.

No, no Consiglere.  Not this time. No more meetings, no more discussions, no more Sollozzo tricks.  Give them one message: I WANT SOLLOZZO.  If not, it's all out war.  We go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street.

Can you do it Mike?

Even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi.

You smooth son of a bitch, let me lay it on the line for you, and your boss.  Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.  I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball Goombahs come out of the woodwork!

Let's say now that we have to kill McCluskey.  We'll clear that up through our Newspaper contacts later.

Did he give you his politicians?

They're going to talk to my father, which means they're going to ask him for something, which means they better get it right.

Because they know that no Sicilian will refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day.

Michael...

Michael you're trying to scare me...

Michael, I love you.

I'm thinking about it.

Yeah Kay, I'm here.

Please say it.

OK. 

Let HER ask.

I'm busy.

You and I are going to move my father right now...to another room on another floor...Can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?

What?

Until the old man tells me different.

I know I'm not the man he was.  But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too.  When it comes to real action, I can operate as good as anybody short range.

To the city.

I don't need them, Sonny.  I'm just going to see Pop in the hospital. Also, I got other things.

What are you, inspecting the barracks?  You ready?  Did Clemenza tell you be sure to drop the gun right away?

Probably a year...

I want to settle things tonight.  I want my father left alone.

He talked to you?

Thanks.

Is my credit good enough to buy you out?

Right.  Don't say my name, just listen.  Somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago.

What are you doing in Mongi?

Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.

Well, we ate everything without you.

Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf 1st.

Oh darling -- is that for me?

Oh, it was.

Okay.

I love jazz.

I don't know. What's the name of your sailboat?

What time is it?  Oh God! Do you always type your letters?  That should be two Ts.

Sure. I love Venice.

See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die, don't you? Okay, Venice is on the list.

I played piano in a few places.

Copy out from here...

He's getting impatient. He wants me to reassure him you'll be home by Thanksgiving.

I did. And then maybe get the jacket and what have you...

I don't think so, Tom. You can't stay on here without money. It's time we all moved on. Besides I'm sick of Mongi. Especially now with everything -- I really want to move to the North. I need to check out San Remo next week, find somewhere new to keep the boat. But it would be great, though, if you came with me. Our last trip before you leave. There's a jazz festival -- we could say goodbye in style. What do you think? A last trip?

That's good.

No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you?

I'm actually a little relieved you're going, to be honest. I think we've seen enough of each other for a while.

Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?

The landlady -- as far as I could tell, the landlady said he was here right now.

In fact the only thing which looks like Dickie is you.

Tom. How are you? You look well.

Far cry from New York.

Marge, good morning. Unusual weather.

You know I feel ridiculous I didn't mention them yesterday -- I clean forgot -- ridiculous.

I just don't believe that!

Frances?

I'm fine.

So I'm learning.

Marge, you know Dickie has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.

Marge, when did you get here?

Dickie did it.

Hello Marge!

Marge, calm down, you're being hysterical.

I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.

As in the...?

Exactly. 10.30 -- 

Hello Meredith.

And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've thought about you so much.

Where are you hiding him? He's impossible, isn't he?

Tomorrow's possible. Do you know Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna?

Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted you finally made it to Venice. I'm delighted, contrary to rumour, you're still in one piece?

It's okay.

No, but I thought that didn't happen in Italy, that each region was completely separate! I was sure that was the --

No.  By the way, officially there are no Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo, Michelangelo very inconvenient.

Don't you put the past in a room, in the cellar, and lock the door and just never go in there? Because that's what I do.

What do you want to change about this moment?

I don't know. Both. My plan right now is to go up on deck, look at the sunset. Come with me.

I know. I'm lost, too. I'm going to be stuck in the basement, aren't I, that's my, that's my -- terrible and alone and dark -- and I've lied about who I am, and where I am, and so nobody can ever find me.

I can't be absolutely sure -- 8? 9? We'd both taken on far too many drinks -- but it was dark, it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car.

Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.

Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he drove off in his car.

November, I thought.

And when did you last see Signor Ripley?

Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San --

I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.

Huh?

If you don't mind, mam, I'd rather work for you.

Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at night.

He'll, what else can I do with it all?

No, these are the kind that couples go to. They're not like the other movies. All kinds of couples go. Honest. I've seen them.

I'm getting a taxi.

Keep it.

Hello, Betsy.

Yes. It won't be long now. Seventeen days.

You forgot "sexy".

Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you're selling... I don't know what... cars... not issues.

No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just...

Kidding around... you know, fun.

With who?

Have you been noticing anything strange?

You sure he's not Italian?

Well, If he had been Italian, they could have been shot off. Sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, If they blow a job or something.

Show me how he did that again.

That's a dollar forty-seven.

A real skunk.

I mean, you handle some pretty rough traffic, huh?

You carry a piece? You need one?

You looking for some action?

Easy.

It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.

I drive a taxi. You tried to get away one night. Remember?

It don't matter. I'm gonna get you outta here. 

Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.

Oh, come off it, man.

Don't you want to make it?  Can't you make it?

I understand, mister. It means something, really.

O.K. It's a date. I'll see you here, then.

Pittsburgh.

Huh?

I never been to a commune. I don't know. I saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me.

Me? I could never go to a place like that.

I... I don't get along with people like that.

Cops don't do nothin.

I want to -- what else can I do with my money?  You may not see me again -- for a while.

Listen -- I mean I just saw the needle of the Empire State Building. You can't see it for the fog!

Thank you, sir. You're a good man, sir.

Listen, son, you gonna get smart, you can leave right now.

Military record?

We hire a lot of moonlighters here.

Why do you ask?

What kind of guns do you guys use? .38's?

Hey, mister, I don't know what's going on here. This don't make any sense.

The taxi life, you mean.

Thanks.

You want to talk about it?

Name your vacation spot, Goodspeed. The Bureau'll pay for it.

Where is he sir?  RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.  What's he doing?  HE'S ON THE= PHONE.  I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, HIS STOCKBROKER! Oh shit.  Gotta go.

No. I'm going to give you dancing lessons.  What the fuck do you think?

It's all I could think of.

Now they only have three rockets left.

Find the rockets.  If they're guarded, kill the men guarding them.

Yes.  To wish someone a prosperous jouey.

Oh, yes.  Yes, he was.

You know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you Pete.  Pete.  Pete.  It's a nice name.

Come on, Delly, look at the country today.  We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb...  You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"

Mr. Chairman, as I understand it, the Fifth Amendment pertains to self-incrimination, and I can't incriminate myself because I've done nothing wrong.  Besides, incrimination is why you have Mr. Clyde working for you.

Pete, I'm so sorry about what they did to you.  I didn't think you'd come back, I thought you'd want to write again...

I've seen you before.  Your picture...

Well... where can we go?

Oh...

It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly.

A loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life? Not likely.

I don't smoke?

Back in '37, you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet.  You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him. You tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking over his shoulder.  So you gave the clarinet to Spencer.

Well, I'm sure we're all glad to see you came through it all right.

Yes sir.  But I didn't go to Lawson to run The Bijou, that was... that was something that just happened. You see, I was involved in an accident in Lawson, and I spent some time recovering there.

That's not a contradiction at all, sir.  I went to the meeting, but I didn't go as a member.

I do.

Peter Kenneth Appleton.  Hollywood, California.

I'm sorry, sir, I have no intention of making light of this committee. And I have no intention of incurring your wrath, Mr. Chairman. I have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath. They've sent me letters from jail.

What's that?

Or the Bijou.  Either one.

We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot of work.

Ah.

Well, after the war, with so many of the town's boys killed, people around here didn't much feel like going to the movies, I guess.  Some of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco.  Wasn't much to keep 'em here, I expect. And now with this "television" thing -- people just aren't going out as much as they used to.

Mother.  She's beautiful.

Oh.  What... what time is it?

Gary Cooper.  And Barbara Stanwyck. Yowsa.

They're...

Did you... did you...

Did you fix the damn film?  It broke in the last reel.

Anybody take it?

Bought the bottle, didn't I?  To the United States of America. Long my she wave.

The G-man?

You should watch what you say.  You don't know who's listening.

Sure, I suppose.  That why you're on a bender?

No, sir.

I guess I did.

Thanks.

Evening, Doctor Lardner.

Aren't you coming?

Huh?

Leo, I was trying to impress a skirt.  You know me, I'm non- political.  Republican, Democrat, Communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway.

I was decorated.

At least I was on our side!  Look, they want me to testify?  I'll testify.  I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear!  Jesus, Leo, this is my career!

"Ashes To Ashes?"

So, it is a blacklist.

Yes.  Leo, goddammit... this isn't fair!

It's wrong, Leo.

No thanks.

Luke didn't smoke.

Not any more.

Well, that's not what they think.

Yeah.  I hope you don't mind.  I didn't know anyone lived here... well, besides Harry.  And me.

Oh.

Thanks.

You bet, honey.

What exactly did you hear?

Yes.  Very.

The one who lives in the white house across the bay?

Yes.

How'd you happen to come here?

Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me.

Lydia liked me, you see. That was the strange part of it. In fact, now that I'm no longer a threat, we're very good friends.

Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love.

Look.

In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...

Yes?

Well, I suppose...

I don't think so.  I have to get back to San Francisco.

That road can be a bad one at night, Melanie. 

I don't know, honey.

I think they'll be all right, honey.

Try my best.

Yes?

That's where the Brenners live.

Down at the dock by the Tides Restaurant. Ever handled an outboard boat?

Alice, I think.  Harry, what's the little Brenner girl's name?

That case, I tell you what you do. You go straight through town 'til you see a little hotel on your left there. Not the motel, that's the other end of town. This is the hotel. Now you take a right turn there, you got that?

Impossible.

Shall I call the doctor?

Stop worrying, Deke. She was in a boat.

We'll make our own fog.

Let me have some apple pie, Helen.  Who said anything about war? All I said was that some gulls...

Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...

Yes.

I told you. We met yesterday.

No. I only led her into believing I believed she was... Mother, it's really very complicated.

Yes, Mother.

I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.

I think he got a little scratch, Mother.

I'm sorry, Mitch.

You're doing fine.

No, not exactly.

Oh, thank you.

Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.

What?

I wish I were a stronger person. There is a long awkward silence. She sips at her tea reflectively.

Yes.

Would you like to rest now, Mrs. Brenner.

And if you don't?

Would you like me to go for her?

Not by the thousands.

Yes, but the curtains were drawn.

What are we going to do about it, Al?

Well...  Well... these birds attacked us.

All right, I'll grant you a bird'll panic in an enclosed room. But, they didn't just get in. They came in! Right down that chimney.

Didn't know how he got in there. Had a broken leg, turned out. Just fluttering all around there. 

Eleven. In the middle of the party, some gulls came down at the children. And Miss Daniels was attacked by a gull just yesterday after...

Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.

Now hold it, Mitch. You don't know that for a fact.

Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.

I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm going away myself. Someone's got to feed them, I suppose.

What?

Aren't these lovebirds?

All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?

Are they moulting now?

We met in court.

Right. I recognized you when I came in. I thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag. What do you think of that, Miss Daniels?

What made it...

That's right. What are you doing in Bodega Bay?

You came all the way up here to bring me those birds?

Well, well, small world. Annie Hayworth.

It's still bleeding a little. Here, let me put this on.

I can't say I like your seagulls much, either. I come all the way up here to...

I was! And all I get for my pains is a... a... a hole in the head!

Seven o'clock then.

He was watching a ball game on television.

How does Mother know what I like to do?

I wrote the letter.

It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.

It is for me.

And Fridays? What do you do then?

No, thank you.

I'll get it.

It's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? It's so beautiful and still now.  I think I've got it all figured out, by the way.

Growing a beard...

It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....

I'm frightened and confused and I... I think I want to go back to San Francisco where there are buildings and... and concrete and...

I thought they'd have stopped by now.

Almost two a.m.

We'll take it slow until we get to the main road.  Are you ready?

I... I don't think so. If we get through town, I think we'll be all right.

Well, all right, but...

What were the crows after at the school?

Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?

It's happening. Isn't that a good enough reason?

Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?

All right, all right!  Hope you figure this out, folks.

Ask this one favor --

Yes.

Ma'am, is you'll allow me, I'd like to give you cause for courage -- Dr. MacFarlane is a great man -- I think he's the greatest man in medicine.  God would not have given him such gifts if they were not meant for Georgina's cure.

It's not the failure. I feel that MacFarlane has taught me nothing. He taught me the mathematics of anatomy but he couldn't teach me the poetry of medicine.

I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.

Aye.

I've heard of it.

But I must tell him -- he must know of it. Please -- tell me where he is.

At Pennycuik.  I know the inn.  I can be there in an hour.

Come in, boy -- come in.

So she told me.  I'm a teacher -- not a practitioner.

Really, Fettes, you irk me with your lack of understanding.

This girl was beautiful -- a wild lassie from the Highlands.

I can't believe that.

Who would believe that?  And you know, someone else might recognize her.  She was as well known as the Castle Rock.

That's the way of it, Fettes.  You bring the lassie to me.

No.

You couldn't do that, Doctor.

Why, yes.

I am not at the school anymore. I left last night.

Your son, ma'am?  He must have been a fine boy for the wee dog to love him so.

You will not have it?

I suppose we can't prevent that, Gray --  -- for auld lang syne.

I take no gifts from you.

It wouldn't be half so much fun for me. Toddy, as to have you come here and beg --

Only Brother.

Burke them?

But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.

Aye.

Where are they?

What do they do that they had to kill her?

I believe they call it a connoisseur's club. Owned by DELT.

Keep that thing away from me.

They showed me pictures, what he did to her. Evidence. Said all I had to do was stand up there and not my head "yes."

Yeah, I know.

I used to be so proud of him. My big deal daddy. And now, he's just a crook. Worse even. And the weird thing is...

Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment yesterday.

Good for you. You do know something.

You killed my daughter.

She was eighteen years old! There were four of them. They stabbed her fifty three times! Where's the fucking accident?! Huh?! Where is it?!

Let's hope not. License and registration please.

Not tonight. Honest.

Look, I'll tell you the truth. Jannie drove us and was supposed to drive us back, she has a license, but I mean... look at her.

I talked to most of them this morning... They were all very curious about the meeting.

If you mean that you are afraid of us--

These other planets -- do they have peace and security?

Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.

That's enough, Bobby. I think it's time you went to bed.

Boy, we had a swell time. Didn't we, Mr. Carpenter?

No, I haven't, Mom. I promise you... I saw it!

He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?

Where is that?

I shouldn't be at all surprised.

Well -- atomic power, I would imagine.

Gee! How could they make a landing?

He doesn't know the answer. And he'll never get it that way.

Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?

Mr. Carpenter" -- you don't seem to know about anything.

All right.

No -- I want to take you to the movies.  Do you think they'd accept these?

Mr. Brady's a cop.

He told me this morning when I examined him. He's seventy-eight.

He says their medicine is that much more advanced.  He was very nice about it. But he made me feel like a third-class witch doctor.

I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.

I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with the internal affairs of your planet. I consider that to be your business -- not mine.

I can judge only by what I see.

You still haven't answered my question.

I'm sorry. I guess I'm just tired of hearing about Mr. Carpenter.  I don't like the way he's attached himself to you and Bobby. After all, what do you know about him?

What about him?

That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm talking about.

Jittery is the word.

Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a few questions. Bobby and I tried to see Professor Barnhardt in the afternoon, but he wasn't in. Apparently they thought I was looking for secrets of some kind.

May I see you for a minute?

I -- I didn't really pay much attention--  Bobby has such an active imagination.

Before I ask you to be honest with me, perhaps I should be completely honest with you--

I can see no other hope for your planet. If the meeting should fail, then I'm afraid there is no hope.

Who?

I'd give you a very good price.

No -- I'm afraid not.

You don't.

No, I'm a resident as of today and you'll probably be seeing a lot of me... I've been collecting comic books all my life... perhaps you'd like to see my collection?

Think of this more as a survival manual... there's our number on the back, and pray that you never need to call us.

He's my brother.

Exactly how many vampires have you actually destroyed?

We don't ride with vampires.

El Vampiro.

We unraveled in the face of the enemy!

Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!

What?...

Get your bike.  We're going someplace.

If you ever want to see Star again, then you better come with us.

No.  Stick around.

I will, David!

Are you guys sniffing old newsprint or something?

How do you know they're not?

Hit the lights again.

To free you, we must destroy the leader of the vampires.

A big legal war wasn't going to improve anybody's situation.  We've all been through enough.  Besides I was raised better than that. Thanks for having us, Dad.

When I dressed like you do now, you threw me out of the house. I used to hate your short hair and your uptight suits... then I went ahead and married one... I went Yuppie and you became a hippie... Were still out of synch.

Gotta keep in practice.  It's a dyin' art.

Been fixin' to build me fence one of these days.  Bought all the materials, then put it off... for about ten years.  Well, one more day won't hurt. Wanna go into town with me?

Bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want... well 'til eleven thirty maybe.

Then let's act like friends. Let's talk.  I know this is a new place, and --

I'm tired now.

Mom... please.

Can't.  Got plans of my own.

Gotta go, Mom.

What's that smell?

Smells like something died.

That's the boardwalk, Sam.

I guess no one cares what I got a job.

This is not a joke.  They know that we know about them.  They're coming to the house as soon as it gets dark!

But, Mom...

No, I'm not...

Mom!

I know.  It's so 'Eighties.'  It's the Cute Decade.

Ohm I would have been... one marriage ago.

Boys Sam's age need a good deal of discipline, or they walk all over you.

No, no.  Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.

I thought you said they needed discipline?

If you want your ear pierced, I'll do it.

What do you mean?

Michael's great.  I like Michael.

Okay.

They'll be coming for <u>all</u> of us.

Come on, Sam, you know before there were malls there was 'like the ocean.'

I can't remember much after the Chinese food that looked like maggots.

What would that make Mom?

Nothing!  I didn't hurt him.  <u>He</u> bit <u>me</u>!  This is <u>my</u> blood!

Yeah.

Nothing.  Nothing at all.

And I don't want any more food with sedatives in it.  I know what you're up to.  Don't think I don't.  And if anyone tries to get in here -- I've got rope.  I'll hang myself before it gets to me.

Watch him close.  Ask him why he didn't kennel the dog.

We'll see...

What's it going to do, being a plant?

No.  The generator.  You got the auxiliary box just off the kitchen. Get to it.  Where's the damn flashlight?  You fellas okay over there?

I'm working it!  Nothing's happening!

Look, I'm just guessing...

I just can't believe this voodoo bullshit.  You believe this voodoo bullshit, Blair?

That's good enough.

How the fuck do I know?!

You're a dead man, MacReady -- or a dead whatever the hell you are!

What clothes?

Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.

What do you mean "you think so?"

All in Norwegian.

I guess I'm the only one.

In this weather?

Could be anything... Men in isolation... some beef that snowballed... got out of hand...

After all this mess.

Started with six.  There'd be four others left.

You reach anybody yet?

Could anyone have gotten it from you?

Damn if I won't.

Mac, where the hell is that pump!!

I ain't going with Sanchez.

Why?

It'll come.  It needs us.  We're the only thing left to imitate...  Give me a hand.

You crazy?  He might be inside already?

What for?

No chance it could have been some new kind of test craft?

Right.  Half of us awake at all times.

When do you think it got to him?

Can't hear you.

And everyone looks like us?

What happened?

This is it?

What are you?

I am called Vox...  ... Now you are Eloi.

Morlocks --

Kalen... hold on a minute.

Yes.

No...

End...?

As slaves.

How do you control the Morlocks?

And who are you, Alexander?  Who are you to question thousands of years of evolution?  This is the world now.  I am fact.

Go back to where you came from.  Or die here.

Yes.  Initiative and daring are not desirable traits in the Eloi.  But you should be happy for her.  She won't remember the creature she was.  She will... become.

No...

I'm a foolish man.

Oh, you won't be running for long...

What's happening to the moon?!

What?

Not here... alone.  May we? Please?

You know I can't.

Holding you... again.

I need... to talk to you.

Shhh.  Let's just hurry on here. We don't have to talk, all right?

Alex, it's just the zoo.

It's only a machine.

I have something for you...

You know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers.

You may not like it, but this is the world we live in, Alex.  Little grey men with little grey hats.

How romantic...

Do you have a romantic bone in your body?

I came by the house every day after the funeral.  And then every week. Then every other month.  Then I stopped coming.  Did you even notice?

It hurt me, Alex.  Very much.

I live with it every minute of every day.

You don't know that.  You couldn't possibly.  If I'd only done this, or that, if I'd arrived ten minutes earlier, or later.  If we'd taken a different path or I hadn't fought the man for the ring.  You have no idea what it is to relive every moment of that night -- consider every action you made -- and every one of them wrong.

Wasn't it?... I have a dream almost every night now.  The Lady and the Tiger, you remember that story?  In the dream I'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors. Behind every door, save one, is a tiger.  I have to make the decision.  Which door conceals Emma?  And I just stand there... looking at the doors...

What is it?

Why don't you come to our house instead?

You're dying here.  Don't you see that?!

Yes...

Well it seems like a long time -- but it wasn't really.  It's rather hard to explain.

Mm.

I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.

More than 800,000 years.

I will...

We all have that dream.

We share everything.

Learning was important?

Orion's belt...

Is it?

Do you have it?!

Ouch -- all right, wish me luck.

Here?

Exactly correct, sir.

No, Dr. Hartdegen, they are not just chickens and roosters.  They are science.  Perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you.  Perhaps they don't "challenge" you --

Animal husbandry is science, Dr. Hartdegen.  I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years.  I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns, social behavior and breeding.  Empirical, exacting, quantifiable records.

New Yorkers.

No...

I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

I suppose so.

We can't change the day and the night, Alexander.  This is the world.

Now you are upsetting my fowl. Please go.

Kalen...

Kalen, right now you need to go up to bed.  You're exhausting Alexander.

They're here!  They're inside the house -- !

And you've no idea where he went?

[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?

[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?

I wasn't pausing to see if you did. [Beat] But, incidentally, you should, because you're birds of a feather.

I'm in it as we speak. [Beat] You're haunting yourself right now. [Beat] I guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else does. You didn't make history like you wanted to, huh, Dr. Becker. It turned out different, didn't it?

No. [Beat] You put me on drugs and then you put me in the Jacket.

I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death?

Later. I'll tell you about it later. We got a session to catch now.

What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries?

Why?

What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?

[Beat] What?

How?

No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.

After I...

I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was, or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [Beat] And when you left, all I wanted was...

Yes.

They're not.

I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.

Good. How's your mom?

I guess I'd ask you why.

Believe me, I know.

Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.

It doesn't look all that different.

I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life.

You have nothing to fear, William.

What are you talking about?

Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.

Is it true?

I've been here for 11 years. It's my neighborhood. 'Course I'm sure. He's as drugged up as the rest of us...I guess he has to be to put up with all this.

Sure.

No, it's fine. [Beat, swallow] Thanks.

Shit happens, and your life changes. 'Bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen. [Beat] So how come you don't know where you're coming from?

[Beat] Why?

What?!

Yes, baby?

Honey.  Nothing's impossible.  You just don't shoot someone like that for no reason.  Maybe he was askin' for it.  Anyway, somebody's husband probably got ol' Harlan.

In the leg.

Why don't we go ahead and let the bureau in on this.

Oh, great.

You do?  Is he a funny uncle? 'Cause if he is, then he and I got somethin' in common.

What's wrong?

Yeah, you're startin' to feel pretty good to me, too.

Stop it!  Goddamnit, I mean it! Louise is gonna wonder where I am. Let go!

Human nature.  I'm majoring in behavioral science.

Wait...!  Um, where ya going?

I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.

J.D.!  Just tell me.  I know you're not some schoolboy.  Now come on, nobody ever tells me shit.

Well, not anymore, Thelma, except for bustin' parole, I haven't done one wrong thing.

I'm a robber.

Nope.  I've never robbed a bank.

Naw, honey, that would be burglary. I never got arrested for burglary. Burglary's for chicken shits.  If you're gonna rob someone, ya just have to go right on up to 'em and do it.  Just take the money.  That's robbery.  That's a whole 'nother deal.

Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.

Are you in town?  This sounds long distance.

Not yet.

I know.  Call me back.  Louise, I love you, okay?

That's the code word.  I miss you, peaches.

Oh my God!  Jimmy!  You... Oh my God!  What are you doin' here?

It's nothin' like that.

Jimmy... it's beautiful!

No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion.

Okay.  I will, too.

I don't know how to fish, Louise.

In case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us.

We'd have to.  That thing barely makes it down the driveway.

It's Bob's, the day manager's.  He's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.

How come he let you go?

Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.

Get the car!

So this is all my fault, is it.

It's probably not a good idea.

Oh shit, Thelma!!  Shit!  Shit! Shit!

Okay.  Shit, Thelma!  What'd you do? I mean, what did you say?

Maybe.  Maybe.  The call of the wild!

Try to.

What for?

What.

You're right.

You mean now or before?

I guess I always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs.

We should have just ignored him.

Harlan.

I believe you.

Yes.

Just asking.

It's good.  It's what the pioneers ate.

What do you mean?

It's him.  He's got California plates.  It's the same guy.

Yeah, right.  We're not gonna get caught.

What?!

Why?

I know this whole thing was my fault.  I know it is.

Where?!

It's grand!

All this for us?

Go?

Say you're sorry.

Hi there!  You alright?

You probably even called us beavers on your CB radio, didn't you?

No, I just meant...

You sent that?

Woogie, I caught you red-handed.

Good-looking?

Each day is better than the next.  Have you ever been, you know... in love with someone?

I don't know.

Yeah, right.

I also called Unsolved Mysteries.

Yeah, I guess he still lives with her. Seemed like a sweet lady -- got diabetes or something -- so I went out on a limb and got him transferred down to Providence.

Hey, look on the bright side --

Huh? But why did Healy?

Uh-huh.

That sneaky prick was probably practicing his jai alai.

I am?

Are you crazy? I've unleashed a psycho on her. She's gonna be fucking pissed.  She's even more beautiful than I remember.

Just relax. Have you hit the cash machine?

Hm?

No.

Huh.

Jesus Christ you're right.

But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.

Who?

Healy, what I just tell you?

Ah, I got a date tonight with that Mary girl I told you about.

Thanks.

I already know it, Mary.

Well, just until I get my PGA Tour card.

That sounds like fun.

A fucking moron.

You don't buy what?

No.

You can't be serious.

Really?  Very, very?

I'd say about a deuce, deuce and a half. Not bad.

Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project?

Good good.

Rollerpig? Are you nuts?

It's a goddamn bunion. It'll heal.

Your turn?

I don't know what you're talking about.

Why the fuck would I do that? I'd be screwing myself.

Same here.

Nice smokescreen, isn't it?

Absolutely! I was there twice last year. Which building is yours?

Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a minute, Tucker?

Who the fuck do you think you are making up that bullshit about me?!

Who?

Hey, this is a pretty nice place.

You were following us?

Look, if it wasn't you who sent the letter, and it wasn't me who sent it?

Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll get every bit as good a work- out.

I'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies. Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer and playing thirty- six holes and still has enough energy to take me and Warren out to a ballgame.

Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.

Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.

I don't know. He's kind of a mook.

So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies.

Puffy, get over here.

Tucker, you look different some how. Did you do something with your hair?

Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.

Huh?

Oh, I don't know. I think proms are pretty dumb.

I mean dumb in the sense that they only happen once a year.

Oh. Okay. I gotcha.

Who's that?

Yup, that's right. Junior prom... kinda.

Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve years.  Don't make me wait another day.

Hm?

Wow. That's too bad. He sounds almost perfect.

Uh no. I think I'm gonna get out while I'm ahead.

Look, Mary, the truth is... I'll be in town for a while now but I don't think we should see each other for a few weeks.

Okay.

Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.

It?  Oh it. All right, these things happen, let me have a look. It's not the end of the world.

I think a little of both.

How the hell'd you get the beans all the way up top like that?

Oh God.

I wasn't trying --

See, the thing is, I heard a rumor that this guy I like was gonna ask me.

Giddy-up.

Huh...?

We're concerned about the possibility of an incident with an innocent cargo carrier. If it turns ugly, the Russians could use an ugly incident and bad world opinion as leverage to force us to remove the quarantine.

What --

With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we were not firing on the ship. Firing on a ship means attacking the ship. We were not attacking the ship. We were firing over it.

Did you have any indication of this from Georgi? Any possible warning or sense of motivation?

So if there are alternatives that make sense -- and I'm not saying there are -- we need 'em. Need 'em fast.

We've got bigger problems right now.

Doesn't matter to me. If I went down in history like Adams, I'd die happy. All they say about him today is --

Give it a rest. You were thinking the same thing, just didn't have the guts to take the heat.

He better. Because nobody thinks he's up to this. Nobody.

Helen and I went out for breakfast. EXCOM's not supposed to convene til eight.

Because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else.

Smoke.

Then they should speak up.

Yeah.

This is from the Highest Authority?

We are not at war, sir, not until we're at DEFCON 1.

Understood, sir. We need to step up the overflights, finalize our pilots' target folders in order to be able to carry out the strikes.

Kids are supposed to get detention.

Busy. But you've got his heart.

Forget it, Scotty.

You're scared to cancel on Daly.

I know, I know...

If we made a trade, we'd be giving in to extortion, and NATO would never trust us again. We'll get clobbered in world opinion.

Then somebody'd better deny it publicly.

Yeah, a good political solution.

I've got to move. What do you have, Kenny?

Jesus Christ...

Six months from now, I'm not going to care. Are you? We'll deal with it.

You're my hero, Carl.

Our police are afraid of them. Please get them out of here.

Sioux Indian, right?

You ain't gonna cut his hands off and send 'em to Washinton, are ya? They done that to one of our girls once. Leo did quillwork, he's gonna need his hands.

No, Ray. You're gonna have to blame that on your grandmother.

That's what it looks like, doesn't it? But that's what a ten gauge, choke-bored, shotgun will look like when it hits your lower back from five feet away.

Who the fuck is he?

How'd you know?

Go ahead.

Cooch. You're my hero.

She talks a lot of shit. We're not doing our job. Jimmy's innocent. "What's the FBI really doing here." Some shit about the Fort Laramie Treaty.

-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --

All I could think of was... not here. I don't wanna eat it on an Indian Reservation, three thousand miles from home.

Yeah. I... I fell asleep. I can't believe it. I --

You didn't tell me about Red Deer Table --

You've got no jurisdiction.

Is that right? What are the trees saying today?

Medicine. As in medicine man?

I see. Forgive my cultural ignorance.

You want solid? That one, single, print he left in the Badlands -- the one the FBI missed and then stepped all over -- it belongs to a man who walks heels first. Like a white man. Jimmy has a serious Ind'n walk -- ball of the foot first. The man who murdered Leo walked like a Wasi'cu.

Grandpa traded with me.  Goodbye.

Crow Horse, listen --

What do you mean?

We've driven a long way. Where is this place?

Uranium. Test holes. Somebody came in from the Nebraska side, and did some shotgun testin'. They're gettin' ready to suck this baby dry.

We're standin' on broken treaty ground, Ray. This ain't supposed to be here. It'll poison the water.

Yeah. It's time to beat the drum. You better wait here. He don't trust the white man.

You go to the council fire. I'm going back in.

He hasn't left this place in twenty years. They got him.

That's right. Turn around.

Jimmy didn't kill Leo. Why do you wanna do this?

-- You desecrated it, it had to be burned.

You forced an innocent man to run like an animal. You've tried to poison my people's hearts against me with your manipulation, with letters I never wrote... you've been watching me eat, work, raise my family... wash myself in the river. And now you're here, arresting me at a sacred place.  In your eyes, that's power.

Black Tail District, X22. You ready for this? Leo wasn't killed in the Badlands. I... I found the location.

Go ahead, Ray.

Good.

Mister Tully.

Must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. How long you been in it?

Yes, Washington sent me, Richard. They sent me here because this whole thing has been fucked. Do you know what I mean when I say this whole thing has been fucked, Richard?

Red Deer Table! What's with you, man?

Well, it is. It is that, too.

I could be, too.

How did you know this was my car?

I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.

It's classified. Like Hollywood says, I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.

Where were you?

Yes, ma'am, At first. Then I was directly above him.

I was inverted.

You let me make a fool of myself.

Apology acknowledged.

I'm special.

Evan... or Maverick.

I'm not your foe. CHARLIE And if he's harmless, you disengage.

How about anything, anything you want to do.

It's not suffering anymore.

I don't know. I don't like being out of control.

I'm fine.

I was flying...my responsibility.

I don't think so, but if that's what you want...

That's what I want.

Not as silly as some. You know the silliest one? ...that we are gods. That we control events on the beach... that we can turn back time...

Who's gonna win?

Well what?

Yes sir.

Yes sir!

I'M UP HERE TOO, MAVERICK.

You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay!

No! Now we're inverted!

Saving them some paperwork.

Okay, okay.

Roger, I've got it.

Rudder's left, stick's forward.

Okay.

You go. I'm staying with it.

Yeah, I guess it is. We did it! We did it...Damn! We sure did it!

But I have to!

Like what?

Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here?

Yeah, he's married--but then again, he,s not dead.

Pay no attention to it. They're just trying to rattle you. It's all psychological. Sit down..and drink.

Right.

I guess that's what I'm doing, then.

Time to go.

What'd you do?

Was.

Thirty seconds. That's all it took to blow us out of the sky.

That's because you don't have any women.

GOT 'EM.

SHIT!!

You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team.

I think I can work it out on my own.

Three guesses.

What makes you think we can get back in?  We don't have the fuel for this. MAVERICK Just get me to him.

Didn't everybody?

Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir.

I lost.

All right.

Or....

I'll have to think about it. I don't know about them. I do know one thing, We've got a lot invested in you. We'd hate to lose it. Even more than those other guys, Naval Aviation needs a very few, very good men.

He ain't got five kids to feed.

Over there man.

Freaks?...'Fraid so, man.  Goes with the territory.

The Last Resort!  Quick!

Whatcha doin' to me, man?!  I got six kids to feed!

How'd you find me?

Thank you.

Definitely.

He's lying.  Hauser turned against you.

Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.

So why am I still alive?

Don't take my word for it, Quaid. Someone you trust wants to talk to you.

Not true, he's one of my best friends...He's got a big house and a Mercedes.  And you like Melina, right?  Well, you'll get to fuck her every night.--That's right.  She's gonna be Hauser's babe.

We can't let him run around.  He knows too much.

Who told you to think?!  I don't give you enough information to think!  You do what you're told!!  That's what you do!

They've got Quaid!  They're protecting him!

Yes, sir.

Don't be an idiot.

It's about goddamn time.

Use your head, you dumb bitch!  He's acting out the secret agent role from his Ego Trip!

I'm afraid you're not really standing here right now.

Swallow this.

Where's Kuato?

You heard the rumors about the Pyramid Mine?

Cohaagen found something weird inside, and it's got him scared shitless.

Yes, you do.  That's why we brought you here.  --  Cohaagen's big secret is buried in that black hole you call a brain.  And Kuato's  gonna dig it out.

Oh, Rekall.

Let me buy you a drink.

Come on, let's go have that drink.

Level 2.  Galleria.

What is it?

I've got him.  The guy in the turban.

Split up.  Find him.

What the hell is this?

Anywhere!  Go!..Just go -- OH SHIT!! SHIT!!

Mmmm.....

Do what?

I'm late.

Mars?  You've never even been to Mars.

Doug...

I swear to God!...I never saw you before six weeks ago!  Our marriage is just a memory implant -- agghh!

Right.  That's why you tried to kill me.

What about the guy you lobotomized...Did he get a refund?

Smart move.  Now while you fill out the questionnaire, I'll familiarize you with some of our options.

Whatever you say...Just answer one question.  What is it that is exactly the same about every vacation you've ever taken?

Aaah, let me tantalize you.  You're a top operative, back under deep cover on your most important mission.  People are trying to kill you left and right. You meet a beautiful, exotic woman...

What's he talking about?

There's something I have to tell you...

Not any more.

I used to model for 'em, why?

Oh, since when?

Of course not.  If Mars had an atmosphere, he's lose control.

We were buddies in the Agency back on Mars.  You asked me to find you if you disappeared.  So here I am, good-bye.

Damn, you know, those kids turn up oil or uranium or something out there...next thing the Feds will be at our door.  "Sorry, time to move. Eminent domain."

Ready as we'll ever be.

One of these days, Melvin, somebody's gonna kick your ass.

You can't fight'em that way...

I'd vote for outer space.  No way those are local boys.

No good.  You need major four- wheel-drive just to get up that jeep trail.

VAL, STOP!  THEY'RE COMING!  DON'T MOVE!

No.  We go straight.

Could we make it to the mountains?

You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?

I was in one.  A bolt of lightning blew up cottonwood tree.  Three hundred head going hell-bent for the horizon.  Wasn't so damn funny, I can  tell you.

Whatever the hell we are, we should quit and go get ourselves some real employment.

Has a lot of rain.

What the hell do we know about seismographs?

Well, sure.

Right.  We plan ahead.  That way we don't do anything right now.  Earl explained it to me.

If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun?

Val!  Val!

Hey, I don't want spend the night out here!

Yeah!  Next time I tell you I'm not hung up...!

Fifteen lousy bucks.

Sons of bitches!

Sure, Earl, everybody knows about them.  We just didn't tell <u>you</u>. Come on, nobody's ever seen one of these!  We're really <u>in</u> on something here!

You got <u>that</u> right!

Naw, don't want to winch it.  That'd tear it all up.  Want to lift it. Some kind of crane with lifting straps.

Yeah.  Where's your truck?

I think we wait right here.

Well, that's why Edgar never got down off that tower.

Just about too damn long.  Bolt pattern's probably wrong anyway.

Not going to pole vault anywhere. That's for sure.

If that ain't the truth.  And I count on them for a little bit of stew meat...Thank you, Fred.

They're tearing down the houses here!  We all gotta get outta here together!  Now!

We have to go into Bixby in the morning.  The concrete blocks are in.

It's...gone...!

I didn't do it!  What's going on?

Yeah, vibrations in the ground.

I know about Esparza.

It most certainly is.

Complain to the Bar Commission.

I would like to put Shu's alleged crime in a context, your Honor. And we do have the foremost expert on prison and street gangs right here in this room... If it please the court, I'd like to call Mr. Reynard.

We had a description of the suspect.

Right, I forgot... We're pledged to protect every mid-level drug dealer in the Tri-state area.  It's an awesome responsibility.

Right. You're right.

Look -- I'm tired, I'll see you in the morning, Eddie.

Chinatown street gang.

"Have to"? No...

I feel much better now.

You know how I know? 'Cause Reynard says he's guilty, and Reynard's full of shit! Look --

You phoned up Art Esparza's wife?

-- Me? Neither.

You're doing a murder case?

EXACTLY!

I don't need sleep!

Screw you too, Kitty.

Exactly what happened then?

About Chinatown. What went down.

You tell me, man.

They g-got the wrong g-guy.

No, s-sir.

Mr. Rabin has no right to --

Don Reynard.

I'd have that checked, Mr. Reynard.

That's right.

I never joke about waiving a client's Sixth Amendment right to trial.

That's big of you, Bob.

Calls for speculation.

Objection.

The great personal sacrifices endured by Mr. Reynard have no bearing on the legal issues, your Honor -- !

That's right.

Albert.

NO! GOD, NO...

I was right behind you, but you're too dumb to turn around.  If he turned around he might get dizzy and fall down.

Bobby... ssshhhh... you killed Mike.

You killed Mike.

We've got our own clock. We'll lock up.

We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.

A trailer was here. What the hell do you think?

Yep, it sure is.

Not a lot around here, no. Got some clubs, but not very many fellas with balls.

OREGON. A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED. SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS.

Did she ever mention any friends?

Do you take cocaine, Irene?

Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.

Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?

Very good, but I can't tell you about that.

He talks loud. And he loves his code.

I don't know, Sam.

Sure, but let's finish up with this first.

Cole said she was 17.

It is a piece of paper with the letter "T" imprinted on it. Take a look.

She's wearing a ring.

May I see the magnifying glass, Agent Desmond?  There doesn't seem to be enough detail in the photo to ascertain the design on the ring.

Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems I told you about last week. You remember the...

Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.

Well, why not?

No, I want to smoke.

Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.

Gotta go, Donna. I'll call you tomorrow.

I know you are and you don't have to do anything crazy to prove it.

No.

I did? I didn't see anything.

Who would do that?

But Bob isn't real.

I couldn't it was Johnny Horne's birthday. I promised I'd be with him. I told you not to call me here.

I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.

Hey, Jacques...

Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.

Yes, I love you. I've told you, but it doesn't really matter.

James...

Okay.  Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday today.

You know it and I know it.

What are you talking about? Bobby didn't kill anybody.

Eating?

I'm sorry, Mom.

Ben asked him to stay late to plan for the Norwegians.

Fine.

Dad...

We're late to get to your mother.

NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.

Oh, Leland.

They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.

How would you know if Bobby didn't give her that?

If Leo comes here, he won't believe that I am out doing the "Meals on Wheels".

As far as we know, nothing.

The man's an ambulance chaser...

Well, of course, it's always dangerous...

Yes.

Frank Galvin's... who's calling please? Bishop Brophy's office...

'They lied.' Indeed! When did they lie? And do you know what a lie is?

You didn't write that figure. And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?

I'm just an M.D.

I know of him.

Through, through his book.

Meth... Methodology and Technique...

I am seventy-four years old.

And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.

I'll rule on that presently.  Proceed.

Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

When she...

Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?

She THREW UP IN HER MASK. Let's cut the bullshit. Say it: She THREW UP IN HER MASK.

Yes!

...that's all right.

I doubt we'll have to go to trial...

It's completely done on a contingency basis. That means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third... that is, of course, the usual arrangement...

Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?

...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...

I. Yes. It is.

That's perfectly all right. I'm kind of rushed. Do you mind if we walk while we talk?

Right. Who called?

Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.  Her doctors murdered her.

...that's perfectly all right.

To do right. Isn't that why you're doing it?

Hi. How are you doing?

Yes...

Yes.

These are your initials, 'K.C.'?

Yes.

She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.

Yes.

That happens.

What?

Overruled...

I think I will.

They, uh, they got to my witness.

Isn't there something you...

You're talking like a drunk.

And what makes you so tough?

What is that to you...?

I don't have a goddamned idea.

I have to talk to you.

I have to reach him. This is an emergency. Could you give me his home number?

Let me talk to Mickey.

Kathy Price.

Missus...

We get it at work. We get the magazine at work.

...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?

I've got nothing to say to you.

I didn't do it, Mister.

Well, maybe you better do that, then.  You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores. You'd do anything for a dollar. You got no loyalty... no nothing... you're a bunch of whores.

I'm going to see you get that chance.

That's for sure, Frank.

Don't touch anything.

Frank, but not now. Frank. You're trying to wipe out some old business. But not now. I understand. But you go call 'em back. You call the Bishop back.

Admittance form is wrong.

I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...

Brindisi versus Electric Boat.

I had a good teacher. McLean versus Urban Transport...

So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'

The Doctors.

Read me what she said.

What did she do?

The 'History'...?

Hello. This is Mr. Dorchester in Records. We're looking for Kathy Costello...

We got to talk.

I don't know.

In New York?

Yes.

We, we were rather busy...

As I've said we had some more...

We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...

Should I?

The Big Boy did...?

That won't start no more fires.  We might's well go home.

Darnedest thing I ever saw - the way that's unscrewing!

We could show 'em we're friendly, huh?  Walk out there with a white flag!  Here - I got an old sugar sack in my car!

All right - I've seen enough!

I'm looking for some Pacific-Tech professors...

Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.

He's top man in astro and nuclear physics.  He knows all about meteors!

Would you like some coffee, General?

No.  The air's going to be full of Jets in a minute...And there they are!

I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.

But they seem to murder everything that moves...!

Yes ...  Fits better in a football helmet.

I think that - gizmo - is a machine from another planet.

No.  I thought you had them.

Right.

I'd like to borrow your car and take a look at it in the morning.

So is the town, I notice!

From the data - and from that picture the Air Force took earlier tonight ...  ... what we've got in the gully out there is a guide ship.  One lands ... Others follow later.  They appear to clear an area, then drop in groups of threes, joined magnetically.  Is that possible?

It was nearer than that.

Okay.  Send the tanker in, but you stand by until that thing cools off. Over.

Well, there's some fellows fishing at Pine Summit might be interested.  They probably saw it come down.  I'll let 'em know...What's it look like?

So?

Yes, but...

Chase...

Five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.

Maybe you should tell me your dream.

I should survive two days in Palmdale supplying soap bubbles for a detergent commercial, don't you think?

Heather, has there been another call?

No.

Sometimes what a child says or fantasizes will give a clue to what ails him.  Did he say anything while he was still lucid?

Is he all right?

They are...it happened in tonight's quake.  It happened just fifteen minutes ago. You must've felt it.

Very well. As soon as we gather the appropriate papers...

Just for a few hours.  Julie'll be with you.

No.  Tonight.  It's important!

He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?

Rex woke me up. He was fighting.

Not sleepy.

Your bed?

Trying to get up...trying to get into our world.

I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.

Home, that's right.

Can we go get Rex, now?  The bad man's getting awful close.

I'm fine.

Just because it's a love story doesn't mean it can't have a decapitation or two.

It's actually been giving me Freddy nightmares.

Yeah...how'd you know?

The way he's writing is so weird, who knows?  I asked him how far he'd gotten at the funeral, and what was it he said...?  Oh yeah, as far as Dylan trying to reach God.  Weird, huh, that he'd have your kid in it?

That's my memory.  And it seemed absolutely real.

Six weeks of this, and you're surprised you've got Freddy in your dreams?  Hell, Sonny Bono says after a while he was seeing his stalker everywhere.  Even at Mass.

John.  It's Heather.  I need help!

Yes.

Hi.  This is Heather Langenkamp.

I think of it as sort of a nightmare in progress.

Exactly.  The problem comes when the story dies. It happens a lot of different ways, the story gets too familiar, or too watered down by people trying to make it easier to sell, or ti's labeled a threat to society and just plain banned.  However it happens, when the story dies, the evil is set free.

That's not what the dreams say he's doing.

Well, see, he's gotten used to being Freddy now.  And kinda likes it here in our time and space, too.  So...he's trying to cross over, from film into our reality.

Now that you have a child, is it possible you've decided horror is bad for children?

Do you let your child watch your movies?

Black's fine.

Yep.

He never would have believed a woman like you existed.

Weight!  Hey!  Blow the man down...

Yes sir.

It was an act of God for Christ's sake.

Gieg, Chuck.

Whatever.

That's what they get for not locking the door.

Congratulations.

Figured what out?

I'll tell you who you are.  You're the glue.  You're the thing that holds everybody around you together. You're strong, you listen and you see things in people the rest of us can't.  It's a gift.

Nobody says you have to be like me.

You don't give him enough credit Chas.

Shut up, Phil.

I know enough.

Look, I just better go.

Maybe it's an air raid.

Forget it.

Who?

Jesus, you never told them?

Yes sir.

Speak up boy!

It was my fault.  I slipped.

Of what?

Oh, on the contrary, the Albatross is considered a very good omen.  It is said they embody the spirits of sailors passed on.  It's very bad luck if you kill one.  And dolphins too.

As you can see, there's a lot to do.

It has nothing to do with him.

You're officer of the watch, George.

Spirits have a way of bringing that out.

Will you shut up?  You sound like my fucking sister.

We'll think of something.

Lemme go!  Lemme go!!

Like you'd know what to do with one.

On the dog watch, night after the storm, I look down into the skylight above Skipper's cabin and there she was, peelin' down.

I've seen 'em.  I've seen 'em.

I figured it out.

Okay donut.  Whatever you say.

Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford.

Barometer's dropping.  The first blow'll come from the south.  Might get interesting.

No self respecting shark is gonna take a bite out of you.

It hurts too much to care.

Long enough.

Fandango, Junior.  I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!

Roger Meris, steps up, it's a corker down the pipe...

Son of a bitch!!

No.

You already have.  Now go on.  Do it.

I don't know...

I hate you, you son of a bitch!!!

Except, a "White Squall".  With all due respect Captain Sheldrake, they're only boys...

... and that you invited him to strike you?  To fight it out on the deck of your ship?!

The Coast Guard 'Eagle'.  She never lost a race while you were Skipper.

... Absolutely not.

I am accountable.

I don't know that anything could have prevented what happened.

I was trying to get her up wind! That's what you do when you're hit a-beam.  Or maybe you're too stupid to know that!

Artie? That you, Artie?

We don't have no paper bags.

How old are you?

Get out.

You was in the Marines, huh?

Thanks, Bobby, 'bout done.

You black?

Oil, gas, cattle, farmin'. Ain't nobody shows off around here. Iguana County's one of the richest in Texas.

Ready for another?

What's that?

Forty bucks...

Hey... I never said you was a pussy... Always figured you had the big ol' round balls for this kind'a thing... Sure would set you and that pretty little girl up good.

That's right... Take one of these.

Juana called. They're stayin' another week.

What's gonna happen when he sees me drivin' the car tomorrow?

You say it's straight ahead a mile?

Real good, Chet... It's been awhile.

I'll tell ya though, it's comin' up to the time when Marietta and me might just set up house together and settle down... I think that time's comin' up right soon. But like you said, everythin's relative.

Muchas gracias.

Whattaya do there?

United States Marine issue, before they made the unfortunate switch to the less dependable nine millimeters. I have it here, in my briefcase.

Don't know that I have... Should I know about you for anythin' in particular?

Guilty on a reduced charge. Hundred dollar fine and ordered to desist. Pigeons carry diseases and muss up the place. You seen it. Plain filth.

Sailor... Lula loves you.

I'm sorry.

Yes, that's so. But there is not much to destroy.

He is my sponsor. The General is the head of the secret police of Honduras.

Darlin', you ain't seein' Santos again, are ya?

I'm stayin' right here by the phone until you find Lula, then I'm comin' to get her. You call soon's you got somethin', even if it's three in the a.m.

I won't tell you over the phone. I'm comin' to N.O. and I'll tell you then.

Somethin' was upsettin' you bad last night, and you wanted to tell me and I figured you wanted to tell me so's I could help...

And to think what coulda happened in that king-sized bed tonight...

See ya downstairs.

You ain't actin', mama.

Thinkin' a second, baby.

It's okay. I hardly used to see them anyway. I didn't have much parental guiding. The public defender kept sayin' that at my parole hearin'. He was a good ol' boy, stood by me... Even brought me some cartons of cigarettes from time to time.

You remind me of my daddy, you know? Mama told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their bodies. He had a long nose, too, like theirs. Did I ever tell you how he died?

Grandmama Pace had a long, smooth white neck. It was like on a statue it was so white?

But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen.

How'd it happen, peanut? He just pull out the old toad and let it croak?

No, he picked me up.

That's good... Now go get yourself a beer.  You fellas have alotta the same power Elvis had... Y'all know this one?

That so?  You want to tell me what, if any, real thoughts you had lately?

We didn't have no TV up at Pee Dee, baby, you know?

Twenty-three months, eighteen days is all. Don't need to make more'n it was.  This couple's goin' on a date to Hawaii. The girl chose him over the other two guys.

What's that, peanut?

What's that?

So?

Yeah, I had my first taste on that trip to Juarez. At that age you still got a lot of energy.

What'd you say to her?

You guess? My parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt Portagee County.

Manslaughterer, honey, not murderer. Don't exaggerate.

Thank the Lord. Well, you ain't let me down yet, Sailor. That's more'n I can say for the rest of the world?

Let's get fed, sweetheart. The light's fadin' fast.

Yeah, it's a real problem for me, Sailor, you know? When I went in that drugstore by the restaurant in Biloxi? I saw 'em by the register and the girl throw 'em in. I'm not big on resistin'. So what about a leech?

You really are dangerously cute, honey. I gotta admit it.

Shhhhh... It's four o'clock... That woman's laugh the other day had somethin' to do with this feelin'?... Like bein' ripped apart by a gorilla, maybe... Grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by a real powerful one.

Anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?

We didn't do nothin' special I can remember. Just talked, is all.

Too bad they don't give an award for talkin'... You'd win first prize. Especially with those tits.

Gotta hex from a voodoo?

You do.

I'm goin'.

Who knows, baby?

Hard to tell what's shakin' in a place like this, honey. You don't want to be walkin' in the wrong door.

We'll find out in a hurry.

Uh huh.

Yeah.

That'd be good, Lula.

I can't take no more of this radio...  I ain't never heard so much concentrated weirdness in my life, Sailor Ripley, you find me some dancin' music right this minute... I MEAN IT!!

Not exactly, sugar... One reason we're in all the trouble we're in right now is cause of what I was doin'... I tried to tell you this before...

What's that?

One bad car accident...

Okay, honey, I'll see you later.

I'll come along.

And Bobby too, I hear...

You talk to 'im some?...

Oughta make 'em happy.

I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn't I?

What makes sense, is all.

SAILOR!!!!

HOLY SHIT!! IT'S THE NIGHT OF THE LIVIN' FUCKIN' DEAD!!!!

Why, how could I not worry? Not knowin' what's happenin' to you or where you are? Are you with that boy?

Are you comin' back here soon, Lula? I need you here.

Mama, Sailor's in deep trouble here. I just can't leave him.

What time's Sailor's train get in?

Got any plans?

Well, you be careful with that boy, Lula.

I don't understand this... I don't understand this one bit. He was supposed to meet me right her in this lobby. Somethin' bad has happened - I jus know it.

Yes.

Santos, why in hell do you insist on playin' this stupid game?

I don't need to explain anymore'n I have... You know damn well.

Santos...

Shoot him.

Yes.

No.

Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

See! I knew you had it all under control.

Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.

Santos... No... Please, Santos...

...Yes you heard me... Don't ever call back here again.

I think Santos or Marietta Fortune.

Is there a contract?... We made a deal once that we'd tip each other off if we ever heard.

Excuse me. Did you, or did you not, have a gun to his head?

We're springing you, Leer. Get some pants on.

You're welcome.

Perfect. Well then, shall we?

Isn't she?

Great. I was hoping I could get a look at it sometime this weekend. Think that might be possible?

This morning. I found a note in the kitchen.

I know. He started it Fall semester.

No. Not yet he isn't.

Tripp.

What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?

Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I mean, besides you and... me?

It's a little late to call Admissions.

Bad enough. And God knows I don't exactly fit the new corporate profile.

Hey, I heard all about it -- the parents, the grandparents, the China town thing -- and I believe you, okay? That's why we're here. Now go get dressed.

I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.

First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.

...we find the jacket.

I have an alternate version of the first chapter.

He was never able to reproduce them.

I just want you to know that's why I dropped your class and said all that shit about the university stealing my money and you being a pseudo- Faulknerian nobody.

It's mine.

How long have you been having them?

And your wife left you.

They're anxiety attacks? That's a little disappointing.

You've got a gun, motherfucker. Drop it!

'Fraid so.

As long as it looks like her, I don't care. You know what I'm saying?

No sweat. Only do me a favor?

Stop calling me Vernon.

Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You won't believe what's happened.

Are you there to not reconcile with her?

...You carry firearms.

She likes old movies like I do, that's all.  Besides, she doesn't really know me. She thinks she does, but she doesn't. Maybe it's because she's Mormon and I'm Catholic.

I have trouble sleeping. While I'm lying in bed I figure them out. The stories.

Really?

Like the lady herself.

I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth about how much he pays for these things.

She is. Ah. Here we go...

You're welcome.

I put you on the floor.

Nothing, it's just that, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were...

So where have you been staying?

Hm.

What kind of dancer?

Unless I miss my bet... my wife.

Shut up, James. You're annoying. Carrie and Howard don't know what the fuck they're talking about, okay? The entire class combined -- including the lovely Hannah Green -- has about one tenth of one percent the talent you have, okay?

Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton.

I would if I knew where I was taking him.

He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one.

Sure. The keys are on the dresser next to... to your book.

I'm sorry. It's these goddamned shoes. I don't know how anyone actually walks in these things.

Walter just got it back from the framer today.

Well. This is... surprising. Does Walter...?

She's left before...

Nothing. I think I twisted my --

No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?

It's -- it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.

I heard.

Really? That was fast.

Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There is something I need to tell...

Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...

About the baby.

I'm sort of helping him work through some issues.

Are you sure you parked it there?

He told me.

Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.

And you're old.

Oh?

I told Walter.

Why yes. How did you know?

James is... I don't know...

Forget it. I should've known better. Your friend is just, I don't know, into collecting weird tricks. Mind?

Jesus. Is that what he told you?

It's a bathtub. What she's standing under.

I'm in love with your wife.

Nevertheless, I'd like to see you in my office Monday morning.

Oh... yeah.

Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know?

Taking the long way home.

Only when I'm working.

It's no Arsonist's Daughter, but I guess you know that. It's a young man's book. It got me remembering how it felt to be young.

I -- just want to say I'm sorry.

Give me a break, Grady.

I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.

Took some talking to convince your super I was a relative.

No shit.

Beautiful. How's business?

K through sixth.

I like the noise.

What?

How is she?

When can I see her?

Is it because of Anna?

Huh?

Yeah. It's really nice.

Maybe I'm not a good man. Maybe inside I'm bad, and I'll always be bad.

Maybe because you're looking her in the face.

Birds.

You live around here?

Do you come here often?

Why don't you just tell me?

Got something to hide?

No.

No.

You said last night. I went to bed pretty early.

I suppose if you're looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty, medium height, medium weight, medium build. Probably not too many men fit that bill.

I count my blessings.

Yeah.

Yes?

Do you like it when he asks you?

Your daddy will always love you.

I don't mind.

What?

Bad idea.

You think reflection is good.

No fucking way.

I'm still thinking about it.

Honest? No.

Forget it.

I don't need someone else.

I suppose it's however society defines it.

I know --

What did you think would happen?

Is this the first one?

Not so fast.

We're little kids.

I feel... okay.

Are you okay?

What picture?

No weirder than a sharp, young, good- looking woman working in a lumberyard.

Most women wouldn't choose it.

Neither do you.

What do you think?

I'll buy a plant.

Hi.

Because I like you.

Twelve years in prison?

No. Never again.

You don't really --

Don't be sorry for me. I did those things. No one else did. I'm dealing with that.

I know.

Well, most people are stupid.  You want to talk about odds? One day I'll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds?

I think it's a fucking good idea.

Do what?

Nothing.

Not when they fly.

We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests.  If you were married you got a state-room.  Otherwise it was bunks.

No way that could just be seawater.

I'm alright, I'm dealing.

I... they're all dead, Bud.  They're all dead. I thought... some of them... you know...

Yeah, okay.  Okay.

Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it.  So as long as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they tell me.

I'm switching off now.

I don't know.  Divorce ain't final.  Forgot to take it off.

No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.

I can get power to this module and sub-bay if I remote these busses.  I've gotta get past the mains, which are a total melt-down.

Chill out, Lindsey!!

Maybe their whole technology is based on that. Controlling water.

Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek.

You noticed.

Hello, Mrs. Brigman.

Okay... Hippy's not going... McWhirter, you can run Little Geek.

No.

Why bring it here?

We're here now.  Let's get her done.

Out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook- up Coke.

Oh... chamber runs.  Uh huh, that's good.  Well, hey... you guys know any songs?

We got Russian subs creeping around.  Shit! Something goes wrong they could say anything happened down here, man.  Give our folks medals, know what I mean?

He couldn't be that dumb.  The guy's a trained killer.  Bud's idea of a fight is arm-wrestling One Night over laundry duty.

How deep?

Perry, stand by on the ROV.  Sorry about this, little buddy.  Better you than me, know what I mean?

I know how alone you feel... alone in all that cold blackness... but I'm there in the dark with you, Bud you're not alone...

What could be more restful than this?...  Excuse me, what is it that you want to try?

Wait for what?

What! After giving us such a run around...

Because it's true. After thirty years -- not having ever spoken the truth to anyone, I should at least allow myself to do so with my own daughter.

You already know what they are.

Sir, if you have no objections, may we start the search?

It takes about twenty to twenty-two hours for the current to reach here from Lisca Bianca.

But even here we were supposed to find who knows what... And all we bring back with us is a crate of cigarettes.

At what?

All I said was that it sounds like a good idea.

More so than the shark?

And why do you tell us this only now?

And how do you explain that?

I think the only way to help ourselves, Claudia, is for us to be together.

Yes... but it's all so conflicting... However, there is some slight indication...

What! Get married?

So... Oh, how I wish that everything were so much simpler... that people could just come together by the color of their hair or the size of their shoes. What size shoe do you wear? Size 9. That's a very lovely size. But I'm sorry, I wear size 8.

Nothing.

Yes, she started to but I didn't feel like staying to listen to what she had to say. If we had to listen to everybody...

Sleep is something one must learn to overcome. I learned how to do it when I was a child. I never slept. And I had friends who even slept less than I did. The one who went to bed first, paid a penalty. And we really didn't do anything. After seeing a movie, we'd go to a cafe and discuss things for a while... then we'd sit down on a bench somewhere... listen to some drunkard... watch them putting up posters or manifestoes...or look at the sheep passing by... or go for a stroll around the market place... Or else we'd go and wake up some girl in the neighborhood by standing in front of her window and calling out her name...

It was futile. We went all over.

There's a shark in the area. Don't move from where you are!

Please, Giulia; must you always emphasize the obvious? I can see for myself that the weather is changing.

I'll go even further and say that her presence here -- I don't want to sound offensive -- could be a great hindrance.

We'll try again.

Yes, she takes care of the garden.

From Panarea. Why?

Early? Is four in the morning early for you?

They didn't seem too good.

You really must do me this one favor.

He loves you the way you are.

Who?

You've got to eat something Agnes.

Dear Jesus...

It made them holy.

I burnt them.

That wasn't me.

What would you like to talk about.

Anything... may I sit down?

God!  But there's nothing to say about God.

Love.

No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.

Yes.

Why should they?

Do you remember the night they said it came?

How were you sick?

Is that where they say it came from... ?

Yes I do,  but I want you to...

Not at the moment, no.

No.

No... do you?

She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that.

Numbers... you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end.

Where did you go?

No. There is nothing else. Just being here at night helps me sleep.

I get headaches. Mommy did too... oh, but she wasn't stupid. She knew things that nobody else knew.

She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.

No, but I can never tell her that.

She'd get angry.

I could never be a mother.

If you're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didn't want me but that's not true, she was a good woman, a saint... 

I breathed!

She can.

She watches... she listens.

... makes me...

Yes.

Because she says if I don't watch out I'll have a baby.

She touches me down there with a cigarette.  Please Mommy, don't touch me like that any more. I'll be good,  I won't be a baby any more.

Yes.

Doctor Livingston.

Of what?

But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?

Yes.

No.

Yes.

I ate.

Fish...  ... brussel sprouts.

I hate them.

Sister Marguerite I think.

They can't hear me that's why.  Oh God... I don't wanna...

Frightened.

Who?

Where?

So she sent you?

Yes.

He frightened you and he hurt you. It's not your fault. It's his fault. Tell us who he is so we can find him. Stop him from doing this to other women.

Who?

Agnes, who did this to you?

Yes.

Yes.

I tied the cord around her neck... wrapped her in the bloody sheets... and stuffed her in the trash can.

Why?

You got to be crazy.

I can get you new evidence next week.

Tomorrow... tomorrow, I'll get it by tomorrow. I will.

Your mother was a resident of Saint Catherines home before you moved her.

Who told you this?

I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..?

I haven't a clue.

Obviously there was.

What's your opinion?

If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?

And in your eyes?

About two years before.

It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...

Earthquakes?

Nothing.

Yes.

What is it?

What sheets?

I didn't tell you because I didn't think it was important.

I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her. And when my husband died and I came here, she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened.

Yes.

I knew that after the fact.

Because I didn't know... 

Don't deny it!

Nothing...

No, it reminds me.

Listen to her singing.

Would it stop you if I did?

Well give me a reasonable explanation

But I want the opportunity to believe. I want the choice to believe.

That's crazy. How could she find out about it?

I'm concerned about her health.

Yes.

I didn't guess until it was too late.

The scandal...

She didn't want any help.

I wanted her to have it when no-one else was around, they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them, but it was such a difficult birth, there was so much blood and I panicked.

Then she's a liar.

What happened to the baby?

Yes, they were playing the queues outside the picture palaces of Liverpool. Scruffy young lads, lacking even the price of a jam roll. Orphans, every Paddy's son of 'em. I saw their potential at once although I had me doubts about the little fella, a savage primitive, that Ringo, but it was him what gave in first. He picked up a brick and heaved it at me and I quelled him wid one fierce flash of me eyes. "Mister, can you spare us a copper?" he said. I was disarmed by the grubby little outstretched mauler ... So, I took them under me managerial banner.

They are?

Hoop, this isn't a hoop, it's a lethal weapon. Have you got a licence for it?

What they like?

How about Ding Dong?

I'm a deserter, too.

Aren't you supposed to be in that box?

Spoil sport!

Oh, my God, he's a natural.

Of course I can.

Have I said something amiss?

I suggest you just give him the photos and have done with it.

Now what's that supposed to mean?

No. I mean, it's probably a honeymoon couple or a company director or something.

You crawler.

What do you expect from an ad lib ... Raymond Chandler?

Come here.

Is it ... is it, really?

Yes.

But the way you did it then sounded so phony.

I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.

You can learn from books.

Well, I <U>am</U> living, aren't I?

What's that mean?

Yeah ... what's in it for me?

I'm not wrong.

Well I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.

But I'm clean.

It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.

Here, Pauly.

For Ringo.

What little old man?

Oh yeah, he's very clean, y'know.

Don't be callous.

Oh, it's a laugh a line with Lennon.  Anyroad up ... It's all your fault.

Aye, before anyone stops us.

He started it.

Ah, go on, you swine.

Come on speedy!

Sit down, the lot of you.

Oink! Oink!

No, not me.

Well, yes your nose is. Very.

What have you heard?

Well, that's just your opinion. Do I snore, Paul?

Aah, shurrup, misery!

Don't be cheeky, I'll bind him to me with promises. Come on, Grandad.

Aren't we ...

Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?

Well, give a couple of minutes ...

And they want me?

Yeah, It's all your fault, getting invites to gambling clubs. He's probably in the middle of an orgy by now.

Get knotted!

I'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know.

Hell, we're equipped --

No.  Just some horrible dreams about smothering.  Where are we?

Where the hell are we?

I'll see what I can do.

What's the terrain down there?

Receiving.

But functioning.

Chaz, this is Dell.  Can you come topside for a minute?

No, I want to go in.

Yeah, but this is hard work.  Can't talk now.

I think that's a pretty reasonable request.

A voice transmission.

Play it for us, please.

Hard to say.

Right.  Talk to you.

Yeah!

The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.

Don't know -- Broussard got hurt somehow.

Don't know -- maybe we'll be real lucky and he just broke his neck.  I knew we shouldn't of come down here.

Is it alive?

Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.

Right.

Here, let me try.

What?

I kind of like it.

Poison gas...

Isn't there some way we can get it off him?

We'd be sitting ducks in the freezers.

Boy, that's terrific.

I'll come with you.

Can you do anything for him?

Oh my God.

No.

What is it -- I can't tell anything --

You will notice, though, that there are no more phases.  Only four forms are shown.  After that the pattern repeats.

I've got an idea, but you're not going to like it.

Our lives are more important. Anyway, we can take a small amount of the most valuable stuff with us on the lifeboat.

We can use the flamethrower.

I should hope so!  And we'd better make sure it's pretty far from the ship when we blow it.

Hey look, somebody has to have his hands free to lock the creature in the lifeboat!

Feast your eyes.

Well... this rock rotates every two hours.  The sun should be coming up in about 20 minutes.

I couldn't make it out -- too much interference.

What is it?

Yes, thank heaven.

We're going into the freezers now.

I was thinking of a line from an old poem: "Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink."  All that space out there, and we're trapped in this ship.

All right, then -- when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door.  Okay?

Look --

Well, it's finally happened.

Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?

Good.  I'm getting you clear too. Let's just keep the line open.

I agree.  This is the single most important discovery in history.

What killed it?

I don't even know what I'm looking for.

Oh well... you know me.

Can't talk now; Broussard's injured. We'll need some help getting him into the ship.

Chaz, listen to me -- we've broken every rule of quarantine.  If we bring an organism on board, we won't have a single layer of defense left.

You bet we made it.  Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive.

Quit complaining; we're in space.

Even simple.

Go ahead, Jay.

So the next step should be --

Now.  If we can get it into the boat, we won't have to blow it up -- we can just eject it into space.

What can I do?

Do you wanna head back and call it in?

Well, just keep looking.  It's gotta be... whoa, Jesus!

Is it dead?

Thanks.

We're what!?

Get her on-line.  Now!

Keep trying!

Shit.  When?

But...

Hey!  I was in shape before we started doing this.

What?

It's moving slow.  About... eleven metres. On the left.

Just behind us, over to the right.

Okay.

Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?

Compensate!

Looks like it.

Just curious.  There's a lot of talk goes around.

Check out the tent.

Again?  How long before we start noticing the difference?

Detour.  Other way's blocked...

Miss Harrington's resting, Mr. deWitt. She asked me to see who it is...

Phoebe.

It's not modesty. I just don't try to kid myself.

I'd love to! Or should I pretend I'm busy?

I'm not enough for a paragraph.

Eddie...

Just some coffee.

I hope you mean what you say, Eve. I intend to hold you to it.

Frankly - yes.

Lloyd. I never have any, and he likes a couple of drinks after we finish - so he sent it up...

She's always been so fantastically devoted to Lloyd. I would imagine that only death or destruction could keep her-

The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...

It's the same thing, isn't it?

Like I just swam the English Channel. Now what?

That's all television is, my dear. Nothing but auditions.

Gable. Why a feller like that don't come East to do a play...

You were there? At the play - last night?

Dear Margo. You were an unforgettable Peter Pan - you must play it again, soon. You remember Miss Caswell?

We have that in common.

Being violently ill to her tummy.

Over? It can't be. I've come to read with her. I promised Max.

I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-

Of course I knew.

Frankly, I don't remember.

How nice.

The implication being that I have not been reading them as written.

Where?

That's nice.

Thank you so much.

I'm a junk yard.

Heaven help me, I love a psychotic.

I understand they've got the Indians pretty well in hand...

And who remembered it? Who was there on the dot, at twelve midnight...?

It's no secret, I know all about the party - Eve wrote me...

She hasn't missed a week since I left - but you know all that, you probably tell her what to write... anyway, I sent her a list of people to ask - check with her.

How is Eve? Okay?

See you...

You're in a beehive, pal, didn't you know? We're all busy little bees, full of stings, making honey day and night-  - aren't we, honey?

It won't play.

To put me to bed? Take my clothes off, hold my head, tuck me in, turn off the lights, tiptoe out...? eve would. Wouldn't you, Eve?

Clyde Fitch, thought you may not think so, was well before my time!

I don't think that's funny!

I can always get a fresh one. Karen - you're a Gibson girl...

It hasn't been laid out, we haven't finished with the embalming. As a matter of fact, you're looking at it. The remains of Margo Channing. Sitting up. It is my last wish to be buried sitting up.

What's all over?

What a body, what a voice.

Margo, let's make peace.

But if I tell you it is - as I just did. Were you listening to me?  Isn't that enough?

Then what would be enough?  If we were married?

Hear, hear...

He does not exaggerate. I was good.

Groom.

A married lady.

I just wondered.

Why you have to go out there.

From what would I be running?

I'm only human, rumors to the contrary. And I'm as curious as the next man...

I know. She just keeps hearin' her dead father play the banjo.

But she just got here...

You don't have to apologize for me!  I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. It's just my way of talkin'...

Well?

Do you want an argument or an answer?

No.

You're not being funny, I could get actors for less. What about the food?

Miss Harrington...

I - I guess I fell asleep.

What for?

What report? To whom?

I don't care if I never get home.

He's the best.

But if I'd known... maybe some other time... I mean, looking like this.

Try...

But there must be some reason, something I've done without knowing...

Well - if she's got to pick on someone, I'd just as soon it was me.

They certainly don't waste much time.

I'm not crying.

- an understudy's performance.

If you told him so, he'd give me the part. He said he would.

It could have been - fifteen years ago. It's my part now.

But not all of it - not that Lloyd and I are going to be married.

Thank you, Karen.

I was dreadful, Miss Channing, believe me - I have no right to be anyone's understudy, much less yours...

You certainly can. Especially if you're me between now and tomorrow morning...

When he gets too close, I'll spit in his eye.

Well, you've done so much... what's new?

- and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man.

Yes, dear. You forgot all about it.

Some snowy night in front of the fire... in the meantime, while we're on the subject, will you check about the hors d'oeuvres? The caterer forgot them, the varnish wasn't dry or something...

What a pity, all that fire and music being turned off...

You've what?

Roughly ten minutes.

It doesn't matter.

Bill's in love with Margo Channing. He's fought with her, worked with her, loved her... but ten years from now - Margo Channing will have ceased to exist. And what's left will be... what?

Don't give it another thought, one of destiny's many pranks. After all, you didn't personally drain the gasoline out of the tank...

Margo. Margo's great. She knows it. That's the trouble. She can play Peck's Bad Boy all she wants, and who's to stop her? Who's to give her that boot in the rear she needs and deserves?

Well. We've spent weekends before with nobody talking...  ... just be sure to lock up all blunt instruments and throwable objects...

Five-fifty-five. We'll be at the station in plenty of time...

Eve?

I wonder why.

I'm trying hard to follow you.

Maybe get some younger actress for the part? Someone who'd look the part as well as play it?

With gestures, of course.

Margo!

Nothing much. She apologized.

Not much.

Did Miss Harrington tell you to call Mr. Richards?

Old wives' tales, born of envy and jealousy! And a phobia against truth!

That was way back...

What is he talking about?

I will.

Twentyish. It isn't important.

Usually at the point when she's got to rewrite and rethink them to keep the audience from leaving the theater!

City Hall, that's for prize fighters, and reporters - I see a cathedral, a bishop, banks of flowers...

I mean really, deeply angry...

What's your being married got to do with it?

We are ready with your call to Beverly Hills...

Go ahead, please...

I love you, Max. I really mean it. I love you. Come to the pantry.

A couple of weeks.

This is real cooperation. I appreciate it.

I promise.

I didn't hear you.

--it was bullshit the way it was--

--what have you been here, nine months?--I been in this business since I was sixteen--

It's OK; I'm sorry I called you a failure.

I was sure trying.

I lived here all my life, I got a million contacts, but they're all bus boys and bellhops.

--Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.

The fucking New York Times.

For the paper, no; for us, plenty.  I waited a long time and finally this big guy--I guess a bodyguard-- he left and I knocked and she remembered me, we talked awhile.

--she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.

It was there. I just don't get it; a CREEP secretary being scared, that's one thing. But what does the wife of one of the most powerful men in America have to be afraid of...?

It's safe, try it, you'll see.

Nixon.

Go on, go on--

--Colson.

--shit--

--shit, who do we know?--

Then he's got an ax.  Call him anyway.

--I haven't said anything--

You asking would I have been one of the President's men?  I would have been.

It makes a crazy kind of sense-- remember that initiation rite they have at the White House? Each new member of the President's staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of Nixon.

Who?

It's nothing personal, though. 

Hmm?

So I guess you could say that we screwed up, but we weren't wrong.

Sir, I'd like to ask you a few--

Whatever.

This?  Naw...

Any idea what he did?

I told you, he had to go out on a case.

You can't.

They never told me anything except my own role--I had to find out the rest in the papers.

When you guys print it in the paper, then I'll know.  I'm a lawyer, and I'll probably go to jail, and be disbarred, and what did I do that was so awful?

--that was awhile ago--

If they ever start calling us goddamn liars--  --it's time to start circling the wagons.

Give me your checkbook then.

We're a long way from high school, Carl...  ...and I'm scared.

--it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?

Which people?

And that makes anything you do OK, is that it?

Routine--I'd just call John Mitchell over at the Justice Department and he'd say "go ahead, give out the money."

--it's gotta be Haldeman--someone from the White House had to be involved--

--let me put it this way: I'd have no problem if you did.

Go on.

--he went to her apartment and he told her--

Look, I told you inside--

I assure you, there's nothing mysterious involved.

It was really nice of you to come, since you'd only met him once.

I have nothing more to say.

...check...?

I'm a proper citizen, I'm a decent man, I don't do anything that isn't decent or proper.  I know I shouldn't tell you this...

I see. And how do you think it reached Miami?

That checks out with our finding, thank you, Mr. Dahlberg.

Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.

I don't know maybe sixteen, eighteen hours a day--we've got sources at Justice, the FBI, but it's still drying up.

If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me?

Liddy--you think there's a chance he'll talk?

Did you change cabs?  It didn't work, something moved there--

You'll have to find that out, won't you?--

The C.I.A.

--I'm Woodward.

No.

It may never come out.

I couldn't say.

--well, what if your boys get it wrong--

You call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local Democratic Headquarters--tell me, Harry, why should I be smiling?

Preliminary hearing at Superior Courthouse?

Anyone but Bernstein.

--remember Toronto, Harry.

--Harry, weren't you just arguing the opposite way?--

According to White House personnel, Hunt definitely works there as a consultant for Colson. But when I called the White House Press office, they said he hadn't worked there for three months. Then the P.R. guy said the weirdest thing to me.  "I am convinced that neither Mr. Colson nor anyone else at the White House had any knowledge of, or participation in, this deplorable incident at the Democratic National Committee."

--can we use their names?--

No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand.

Haldeman.  Right?

A girl. Melissa.

No, none of those.

Sorry.

Sure.

Suck me...beautiful?

Like what?

When was the last time you looked at the facilities here?

Pardon me?

Why is this?

So Oz, you almost made it, huh?

Well the same things you do.  Hang out with friends and stuff, you know, whatever.  What do you think I do?

Yeah, me too, okay, cool.

Really?  Cool.  Tell him his subs are great.

What?

Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.

You can't sing at the competition.

...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.

What's that?

I know, it sucks!

Of course he does.  What about you? Have you just never had one with Kevin -- or have you never had one, period?

But that one time --

Well of course I'd want to give her that.  I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her?

No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!

I don't get it, that really works?

Oh yeah, baby, I'll give it to you.

Nothing, I just hugged her back.

Pontificated.

Right.  That gives us...

No -- it's true.  He is...really... big.

Went home to shit.

Well...dammit, if I'm doing this, how the hell am I gonna watch?

Shut up.  You're supposed to be supportive.

Nothing!

Dad, come in.

These are for you.  From father to son.

Oh, okay.  Here's let me show you.

Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.

I know.  Hey Nadia.

Okay, okay.  I'll let you hit those books.

Michelle.

Really?  You seriously want to go with me?

Yes!  And he was such a dork!  And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care?  Because it was so funny!

Now, I have two rubbers.  Wear them both, it'll desensitize you.  I don't want you coming so damn early.

A <u>hot</u> cartoon.

C-Span?

"Fun loving" -- insane.

Hang in there, buddy, you'll get there.

After getting laid?

Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes.

Strip?

Nadia, I can't --

Oh no.

God dammit, Stifler!

This just got a hell of a lot better.

You think so?

Kevin, this is serious!

I think "shithead" really says it.

No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems.  Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April.

Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.

You want to do it?

Yeah.  Are you sure?

I want to hear you say it.

Yeah.

I know.  Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends?

Your little pact.  Jessica told me all about it.  Way to go, Kev!

What was I gonna do, call dad?  I don't even know his number.

Uh...I thought you might know a trick or something.  To make her, you know...

What's that?

Oh shit dude, the L-word!

I'm such a loser.

This is different.  This is better. Think of when you're working out, Oz. You need a partner, someone to spot you.  Someone to keep you motivated.

Dude, prom sucks.

I can't, I have no idea how he's doing it.  And that leaves you trailing, Jim.  You gotta get your act together.

Attitude?  Me?  I think that <u>you</u> guys should be more enthusiastic.  Shit, we've been trying to get laid forever, and tonight's the night we've been waiting for.  We're in this together. Don't back out on me now!

I don't care.

He didn't?

Yeah.  So you want double condiments on that?

Dude, he does not.

Keep it down, dude.

I'll bet you do, you little horndog, she's givin' you fuckin' stiffies, right?

Yep.

Oh sure, it was all mean old Marcel's idea. Give me a break! We didn't tell you because it's a wild goose chase! Not to mention disgusting. Look...

But you better hurry.

What a coincidence, I am someone!  Mmm. Calvin Klein's Obsession. Now it's mine too.

It's all in the tongue. Another bottle?

Ah. The mating call of the blonde. The night is young, the moon is bright, whataya feel like doing tonight?

AHHHHHHH!

Oh, big man. You can beat up a couple of cadavers. Well let me make something real clear, asshole. If you don't kill yourself, at midnight tonight you're gonna transform and murder innocent people!

You? You're Madame Flocquet? I pictured a fat lady with an apron, not - I don't know - La Femme Nikita.

Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.

Come on. I'm from New York - the "shoot me" state. Don't wait up.

Andy!

You must get out of here. It's not safe.

Serafine...?

A la votre.

Listen, I'm coming over. Don't go anywhere. Stay right there.

A cure?

I had to be a damn Hemingway hero. Well I'll tell ya, the old man and the sea didn't go through half this shit.

I didn't know he had a wine cellar.

Yeah. French fries...

Really.

What?

FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!!

Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -

And you call me a moron...

Why isn't it doing anything!?

What?!

Oh no... no....

Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -

You think it's silly. But do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep?

My God! Serafine's right. It's time to go. We'll talk soon.

Why the fuck would I do that?

Andy? Andy is that you?

Yeah, I finally "checked out", thank God. But there's a bit of unfinished business.

No we can't. That's the problem. God knows it would beat hanging around with you!

Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.

Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?

God, well don't let him go! Catch him!

Something about a monster, underground, in the catacombs under Place Denfert.

You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?

I was showing Sonya something . . .

I know, but I had to because . . .

No.  I'm running <u>to</u>.

She's quite right, Dmitri, a man of my stature should not have to

I'm fine.

Yes, your highness.

Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!

Who are you?!

Perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . .

I was all out of dynamite!

That's a good idea - a great idea - stretch your legs  ... stretch then that way.

Why?

You shouldn't have pushed us!

You are the Princess.

Hey! It doesn't matter! You gotta make your own way in the world! Don't be sorry for me! I'm going to get what I want don't you worry!

It's okay. Didn't hurt..

I'm glad you	did too.

I don't know! I don't want to hurt you...

No, he just wanted to know you were happy.

How do you know?

What do you think is the most humiliating way to die?

We will.  We <u>have</u> to.  Come on, Vlad - she's out there.

Would you have leaned over Rembrant's shoulder and told him to paint faster?

"Wake up, your highness" - we should start getting used to saying it.

Yes. And I hate that in a woman.

Ah! Let us begin!

It worked in Odessa...

She found her home. Maybe it's time I found one too!

Rasputin!

How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!

You! How dare you?! Stop this car immediately!

No. Empress, you --

I should go

Oh good! We haven't seen an Anastasia in several days!

Oh, heavens, no... but ...  She is going to be at the Ballet Russe tonight! That's the Russian Ballet - Russe for Russian, oh those crazy French... they only go to see which dancers will defect.

No. Yeah, once in a while. You know, like occasionally.

This guy's on television! Alvy Singer, right? Am I right?

Alvy, you are totally incapable of enjoying life.

Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.

Yes.

Why not?

Tsch.

Well, stop listening to him.

Well, he's spitting on my neck! You know, he's spitting on my neck when he talks.

That movie makes me feel guilty.

It's always some kind of an excuse. It's- You know, you used to think that I was very sexy. What... When we first started going out, we had sex constantly... We're-we're probably listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.

Oh, all right. All right! It's all right. Here.

Oooh! Here! Here!

Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the pot!

All right, here! Oh, God, it's disgusting!

Yeah, I-I think you're pretty lucky I came along.

Hi. Oh, hi. Hi.

I don't...  I don't... Geez, I don't know, I've... I wa- This... yeah, I got this VW out there...  What a jerk, yeah. Would you like a lift?

Well, where is it? I-

You keep it nice.  Can I ask you, is this-is this a sandwich?

Don't be funny.

Well, thanks, thank you. You-you're a wonderful tennis player.

You sure?

Yeah, uh, I'm gonna give him one more year and then I'm goin' to Lourdes.

'Cause I don't like to get naked in front of another man, you know-it's, uh...

'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen.

Well, uh...  You're what Grammy Hall would call a real Jew.

Yeah, yeah, I sorta dabble around, you know.

Oh, you... you're very popular, I can see.

Gee, boy, what do you have? You have plague?

you're gonna like night clubs, they're really a lotta fun.

It's terrific.

Really?

Yeah.

Oh, all right.

Yeah... oh, uh, and I'm gonna have a pastrami on white bread with, uh, mayonnaise and tomatoes and lettuce.  Tsch, so, uh, your second wife left you and, uh, were you depressed about that?

Oh. And your first wife was Allison?

Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm a wreck.

I tried to take my pants off over my head...  ...my ear.

Yeah.

M'hm.

Oh, yeah.

Come on.  Yeah. You know what? You know, I like you, I really mean it. I really do like you.

Yeah.

I guess you think that I talked you into something, huh? 

Hey, don't be ridiculous.

'Cause adult education's a wonderful thing. You meet a lotta interesting professors. You know, it's stimulating.

Well, what's the difference, anyway?

No, no, no, what... You can once, you can live without it once. Come on.

M'm, wait, I got a great idea.  Hang in there for a second. I got a little-little artifact. A little erotic artifact, that-that I brought up from the city, which I think, uh, is gonna be perfect.  I just... there... There's a little Old New Orleans... essence. Now-now we can go about our business here and we can even develop photographs if we want to. There, now there.  M'mmm. M'mmm. Hey, is something wrong?

Let's just do it, all right?

Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.

Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass  because, you know, I'm, like, a comedian-

so if I get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. You know-'cause they're always laughin'.

Well, the twelve o'clock show is completely different than the nine.

Why? 'Cause I... was walkin' along a block behind you staring at you? That's not following!

Paranoid? I'm looking at you. You got your arms around another guy.

M'm.

You cried? I've never once cried. Fantastic...

Sinatra?

Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had glasses. So whatta you saying that I-I'm suffocating you?

Will it change your wife?

And, Alvy... and then I told her about how I didn't think you'd ever really take me seriously, because you don't think that I'm smart enough.

There's a spider in the bathroom.

I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.

I know, I know, and a first-aid kit and a fire extinguisher.

Yeah.

Well, I like to try to get all points of view.

Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?

Hey, don't squish it, and after it's dead, flush it down the toilet, okay? And flush it a couple o' times.

Yep. I didn't think it was that big, but it's a major spider. You got a broom or something with a-

I'm sorry. I had the television set had the television-

Oh, no, no, I think we're both much too mature for something like that.

Holy cow!

All right, all right, you don't wanna go to the party, so uh, whatta you wanna do?

And... I don't know... I mean, six months ago I-I woulda done it. I woulda done it, just to please him.

I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.

It's that they don't throw their garbage away. They make it into television shows.

Well, let's see now... If it has my name on it, then I guess it's mine.

Right. And you-and you know what the beauty part is?

Yeah.

Commentary.

What's fascinating is that it's physical. You know, it's one thing about intellectuals, they prove that you can be absolutely brilliant and have no idea what's going on. But on the other hand...  the body doesn't lie, as-as we now know.

"Why-why do you always r-reduce my animal urges to psychoanalytic categories?  he said as he removed her brassiere..."

Don't get upset!

Oswald and ghosts.

The only word for this is trans- plendid. It's trans-plendid.

Hey.

I'm not myself since I stopped smoking.

Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.

Don't you see? The rest of the country looks upon New York like we're-we're left-wing Communist, Jewish, homosexual, pornographers. I think of us that way, sometimes, and I-I live here.

What kind of good memories, Max? Your mother and father fighting all the time.

Look, now, Charlie, give me a big laugh here.

I don't know, I mean, I-

I'll handle it. I'll handle it. Hi.

No, no, I came out here to get some shock therapy, but there was an energy crisis, so I... He's my-my food taster. Have you two met?

She was going through my pocketbook!

How can we afford it? On your pay? What if she steals more?

Then there was Jerry, the actor.

I look pretty.

If only I didn't feel guilty asking Annie to move out. It'd probably wreck her. But I should be honest.

You think so? Do you really?

Yeah.

I was a great beauty.

Oh, I was quite a lively dancer.

Oh yes.

A triumph.  When did you get here?

Would it make a difference?

I'm not that good.

The neighbors from hell.  The kind that lay in wait.  I'd rather move actually. Wouldn't I?  Wouldn't I?

Oh, she's really enjoying it.  I think. Is Mac okay?

Of course.

To dander.  Otis.

Didn't I say?

I'd say it was down.

You want a Tylenol, or something?

I love her too, Joe.

Yeah.

Damn straight.

I'm not so sure.  Look again in three months.

I should have damn well bought it.  Well, we can't afford it.  The movie's going to eat up a year of my life and I'm getting paid next to nothing.  Do you know how much Skye Davidson's getting?  Four million.

She left a note.

Excuse me?

I don't think so.

I adore him.

I know.  I know that.  Don't spoil it.

We've only been over this how many times?

Well, you're a tower of support.

Did he promise?

Hardly...

For good.

Well, it might be Clair.  They're threatening not to come...

I'm going to throw up.

Really?

You can never be too early or too thin.

Panes is not on your team anymore.

Whatever!  You know how he gets.  Well, he went absolutely bonkers.  Lucy and I were frantically trying to scramble into the dumb waiter and I didn't fit any more. It was almost fatal.  And that, my dear friends, is the day...

Or shitty!!  Otis!!

That hasn't the first fucking thing to do with love.  It's whether we can live together... like this!  All the time.

DO I want anyone else?  No.  Do I want to be with you for the rest of my natural life?  I'm trying.

Your director and your co-star of your current movie.  Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally.

Sally, for Christ's sake.

Don't push me away.

Don't do this.

You changed your mind.

I'll never forgive you.

I'll be with you.

You don't have to.

Will you make love with me?

Sure.

Nothing that can't be exchanged.

I'm not much of a reader, but I do love autobiographies, even biographies sometimes.  Mostly non-fiction.  Did you read the new Styron?

I don't know why Joe, we've known each other how long...

It's Jerry's worst idea.

What?  Oh yeah, the camera man?  They gave me a list.

Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux.  I see you've moved up from the soft stuff.

Uh-huh.

Hm.

And you know, he really does not.

You're never too old for a lolly.  I'm having one.

Lemon.

I think he's really angry with me too.

And he doesn't smoke?

Come here.

I like you.

Oh, I love that.  I'm just great.  I'm so happy to be here. And I apologize for invading you.  And I'm so happy you asked me to.  I'm so touched.  I know how private you and Sally are.

I'm sure you understand.

You know what Sally Therrian was saying about your spine and your brain?  She didn't pull that out of thin air.  It causes brain damage.  You'd better drink a lot of water.

You're not serious.

Why?

Don't go in, Ryan.

Well, whoever did this is amazing.

You fucking cow, can't you read?!

Not at all.

No, no thanks.

Do Peter Sellers again.

Suicidal.  It's much less codependent.

She could be playing the role in Joe's movie that should be yours.

No.  No, not like the last time.  She was the rest of my life.

I wasn't finished.

I'd cut off her red wine if I were you.

What does that mean?

I'm worried about your Galiano.

That's not an answer, is it?

You don't need to thank me.

It's just very distracting when you're trying to work.

Rose.

I'll be right out.

What are they?

Ah.

Hmm.  Where are my kids?

She took our wedding photos, for chrissakes.  You don't trust anyone.

And the food sucks, I know.

Sophia!  I'm not even pregnant!

He wants playmates.  Oh he's a sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him. But he's not going to be a good father. He's just not parenting material.

And Cal's this massive adult?

Neither does Joe.

Not nice.  Not kind.

Sorry I got you in trouble.  But listen, you can share my rations.

That's right!  He slaughtered hundreds of termites single-handedly!

Wanna dance?

I work in the palace, I don't get out much.

You -- you think I'm right?

Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off this time.  Are you crazy?  This guy's built like a pebble!  You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays --

Well, if single-handedly vanquishing the enemy and slaughtering a whole nestful of termites makes someone a hero, yes I am.

I'm Princess Bala.

I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!

Quiet -- sshhh!!

Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?

Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!

I've got a <u>name</u>.  It's <u>Z</u>.

Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.

Well...no, but --

Well...I <u>am</u> the oldest.

Forget it.  You go ahead, I give up. I...I don't know what I was thinking. "Insectopia".

No -- I can see it in your eyes.  I'm a goner.  It's alright, Z.  In this ant's army, a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus.  I can't feel my legs...

Princess!  You look -- outstanding. Is there anything I can do for you?

Outstanding.  Princess...?

I've never seen anything like it, General, they're they're...well, look!

Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors. Nothing reliable.

Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.

No, sir!

Now I've heard a lot of scuttlebutt about a <u>food shortage</u>.  Well you boys are gonna be taken care of.  But in the meantime we're gonna eat the enemy for <u>breakfast</u>, we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>lunch</u>, and we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>dinner</u>!

Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant.  And I know each and every one of you boys will do your duty.  Dismissed.

Damn, I'm proud of you, boy.  I wish I had a hundred ants of your caliber. The world would tremble.  Now, time for some R and R.  You're invited to the royal victory party!

Engaged?  As in you're getting married?

So...you two are in love?

Well it wasn't a masquerade, really, it was more what I'd call a clever ruse --

Look, General!  A darling baby soldier!  Don't try to be a hero!  Just make sure you come back in one piece!  Next!

They should be...  But there's something funny about that soldier.

But General -- this tunnel is your baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?

Very well, General -- I know you -- all work and no play!

YES!!!  You know, people ask me, "Doctor, why are you always happy?" And I tell them it's mind over matter.  I don't <u>mind</u> that I don't <u>matter</u>!  Do you get it?  Do you get it?

...Ants...

I'm not in the mood.  Even when they're off work, they follow orders.

My mother.

Yeah.  How much?

That's right.  Maria Ouspenskaya. BLONDE  Hiya, Ouspenskaya.

Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What you need is a good horse-whipping.

Yes, Mrs. Dreyfuss. He starts out with a worried backward glance toward the two. Fran is just sitting there, the spoon in her hand, not touching the soup.

Morning, Miss Kubelik.

Why not? Now that they're kicking me upstairs --

Would you like to?

I thought maybe we could have a bite to eat first -- and then --

Yeah.

Oh.  You mean -- like a girl-friend?

Well -- I could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.

Meet you in the lobby. Okay?

Sounds good.  How do you know where I live?

How come?

Eight-thirty!

Thank you.  I thought you were avoiding me.

Don't be too sure. Just because I wear a uniform -- that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.

I'd better get back to my elevator. I don't want to be fired.

Why?

Someone from the office.

Miss. 

As soon as I can walk.

He's a liar. But that's not the worst part of it -- the worst part is -- I still love him.

You don't have to entertain me.

A bad insurance risk?

A cemetery?

You really think so?

Can I have that pad and the pencil?

You bet. I got a terrific hand.

Just somebody delivering a bottle of champagne. Like some?

Who'd care?

For me?

I don't want to talk to him.

Oh.

I was washing my stockings, so I decided I might as well do your socks.

As a matter of fact, I'm a pretty good cook -- but I'm a lousy housekeeper.

I guess so.

No, I don't.

In the knee?

That's terrible.

No -- just come as you are.

Oh.

Nothing's changed. You know, we never finished that gin game --

Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?

Shut up and deal!

Good evening, Mrs. Lieberman.

So who did you think it was -- Kris Kringle? What was going on here last night?

All that marching -- tramp, tramp, tramp -- you were having army maneuvers maybe?

Yes, sir.

What kind of joint are you running?

Loyal, cooperative, resourceful C. C. Baxter.

West 67th Street. You have no idea what I've been going through -- with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key --

Not yet. But I hear it's one swell show.

Well, that's very kind of you -- only I'm not feeling well -- you see, I have this cold -- and I thought I'd go straight home.

Oh, you don't have to worry --

You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen --

Sir?

And I've got good news for you, Baxter. All your troubles are over.

What do you mean, sorry?

No I didn't.

Just following doctor's orders. I've decided to become a mensch. You know what that means? A human being.

Oh, this is Mr. Matuschka -- he's Miss Kubelik's -- he's got a cab downstairs --

I know.  Mr. Eichelberger -- in the Mortgage Loan Department -- last night he had a little Halloween party here --

Maybe you're using the wrong approach.

Could be she's just a nice, respectable girl -- there are millions of them.

So long, fellas. Drop in any time. The door is always open -- to my office.

What do you want?

I don't care if it is Marilyn Monroe -- I'm already in bed -- and I've taken a sleeping pill -- so I'm afraid the answer is no.

I'm all out of liquor -- and there's no clean glasses -- no cheese crackers -- no nothing.

And I couldn't get into my apartment -- so at four a. m. I had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut.

Look, Mr. Vanderhof -- I've got you down here for tonight -- but I'm going to be using the place myself -- so I'll have to cancel.

I hate to disappoint you -- I mean, many happy returns -- but not tonight --

Get that stuff out of her stomach -- if it isn't too late. You better put some coffee on -- and pray.

Miss Kubelik -- Fran.

Mister -- Miss -- such politeness!

Just as long as she's okay.

Aren't you?

Well, as a doctor, I guess I can't prove it wasn't an accident.  But as your neighbor, I'd like to kick your keester clear around the block.  Mind if I cool this off?

I don't know what you did to that girl in there -- and don't tell me -- but it was bound to happen, the way you carry on. Live now, pay later. Diner's Club!  Why don't you grow up, Baxter? Be a mensch! You know what that means?

Yeah -- I'm giving up the apartment.

Me? Oh, you mean my body. Don't worry, Doc -- it'll go to the University -- I'll put it in writing --

Happy New Year.

Because as far as I'm concerned, he's a no good fink. Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter -- never even answered me.

My husband. He's in Havana -- in jail.

No.

Might as well go to mine -- everybody else does.

Mrs. MacDougall, I think it is only fair to warn you that you are now alone with a notorious sexpot.

The party's over.

Hit by a swinging door? Or maybe a Yellow Cab?

Dr. Dreyfuss.

You can't sleep.  Come on, Fran -- open your eyes.  Let's get her walking. We've got to keep her awake for the next couple of hours.

What for? You haven't done anything -- it's him -- what a salesman -- always the last booth in the Chinese restaurant -- and the same pitch about divorcing his wife -- and in the end you wind up with egg foo yong on your face.

Six weeks. But who's counting?

Handle what?

I love you -- remember?

And just think -- right now there's some lucky girl in the building who's going to come after me --

Stop that, Fran.

Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --

All set for what?

It won't happen again.

You let me go four years ago, Jeff. Only you were cruel enough to make me sit out there and watch the new models pass by.

See if they'll what?

What's it matter? Get to the point.

Yeah, I caught your show at Hau Fat.

Well --

Get out --

I know, I know, it's all right. Come in this way. It's mined over there. This way. It's all right.

Yeah. Way north.

None.

Let's talk about you.

Yeah -- you can really get hung up on them like the cat in the Delta.

He was working A.R.V.N. patrols and had one a them little cocky gook asshole Lieutenants -- anyhow, the Lieutenant took his new Playboy one day, sat on the end of the dock, and wouldn't give it back.

What did you put in all those ammo boxes?

I hate that -- Every time I hear that noise something terrible happens.

Cook school -- that did it.

No shit.

I don't know.

Probably is.

That we're dumber than we look.

The draft of that river might be too shallow on the point.

I'll go with him --

You'll see soon enough -- get going, sailor --

I am -- I'm Captain B.L. Willard. This is Chief Warrant Officer Phillips -- it's his boat. We were shot up bad downriver and need repairs and food -- we can pay you in gold.

If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon Group, we'd like you to come with us.

Ours.

What is it?

What're you askin' me for -- put 'em in the first helicopter comes in tomorrow.

Charlie?

He was the tragedy -- the tragedy of this war.

Okay, Willard, sit down.

This gentleman or myself ?

A lame ?

But why ?

Of course. I -- Once we make our repairs, we could send word, we could have you evacuated from here.

You'll get blown outta here some day.

Do you know that jungle?

We endure, captain -- you can blow up the house and we will live in the cellar -- destroy that and we'll dig a hole in the jungle and sleep on it. Burn the forest and we'll hide in the swamp. all the while, we do but one thing -- clean the blood off our bayonets.  Au revoir, Captain.

I haven't surfed since I got here.

Sure -- fine --

It's hairy ,though. That's where we lost McDonnel -- they shot the hell out of us. It's Charlie's point.

Yeah -- Na Trang told me to expect you -- we'll see what we can do. Just stay out of my way till this is done, Captain.

Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.

Who knows.

You'll find enough Cong up there.

Music?

It'll get here, soldier.

I'm Kurtz.

Oh Captain, that is so true.

I'm gonna get you out of here.

I'm taking you back.

Yes, I know...

Yes I was... He said his last words to me.

He can't kill us.  We're on his side.

Sure.

No -- leave it --

We'll be needing some supplies and fuel -- do you know anybody who can give me a hand?

You're Australian?

His name is...

No. Not really.

What things?

The river is beautiful.

Then Philippe will have to kill all of you.

Big show in the parade grounds this noon -- some boss stuff --

Stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell --

Son of a bitch, sir.

23   CONTINUED:  

Now, why don't you get around to saying what you want.

Mind if I get some stuff from my kit?

89   CONTINUED:

139  CONTINUED:

150  CONTINUED:

I'll get you there all right.

94   CONTINUED:  

There isn't one, unless Corbett's men get here before the plane does.

I'd sure like that favor you offered a while back.

168  CONTINUED:

Your infrared camera?

Back against the bars.  Now.

Six months.

She's dead.

I was gone, in September, laying traplines.  She went to our cache for some meat.  Got mauled by a bear.  Tore open her skull. -more-

The radio's on the fritz.

Be right back.  I left my camcorder in the car.

Be careful -- there're two of them.

I'm staying.

Nothing broken.  C'mon, we have to hurry.

No big deal.  We just got off on the wrong foot.  What's your name?

New to the country, kid?

Ecology.  Folks use that term for everything but what it means: who's eating who.

Yeah.  Maybe so.

-- Killing is what you know.  Pack some food while I prep for the flight.  I'm sure not gonna let him go.

Hunting and trapping was a damn fine life.  Me and Mitchell, Bob and LeMalle, we were teams.  I'd always go with Mitchell.  Good man, Mitchell.  I'd let Bob worry about goddamn LeMalle.  We'd hire a plane in October.  On the way to a dirt airstrip somewhere, we'd drop supplies.  We'd land, tell the pilot to come back for us a few days before Christmas.

We're not sitting here 'til November.  There's a cargo plane coming to Devil's Cauldron in four days, and I'm putting you on it.

It wasn't my idea to crash the plane.

We've got another two hours of daylight.

It could blow over tomorrow, too.

If that means freeze my balls off, no thanks.  I'll be okay.

You got one?

Too bad.  We'd be out of here in a few hours.

An appetite.  Maybe you won't die after all.

Don't bet on it.

Lets us watch each other's backs over a wide area.  Only thing messed me up this time was getting arrested in the baths. ELT was in my duffel bag, not around my neck where it should've been.

Shut up!

Ben...boys.  Yeah, real slow, and I'd like to keep it that way.

-- Forget it.  And try not to bleed on my throw rugs.  Why do this?

Just stay out of my face until I'm gone!

I just as soon he stay gone. Fool could've got us all killed, arresting Ben Corbett here in town.

Aw, Jesus.  Told you this was trouble.  What about you, big shot?  Do something.  Who's side are you on, anyway?

Quit fucking around.  Get in.

They'll have to come right past us.

Spencer's doing fine. So what are you saying, that you're frustr...

Don't be silly. How bad?

I'm a waitress.

Yes.

No. I asked. They said it's not covered under my plan. And it's not necessary anyway.

You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?

Okay.

I see the help -- judgement call.

It's okay -- I'll sit here.

What's with the dark?

What are you doing here?

Note. Put it in the note.

Hey, what I did for you is working out?

Bettes tells me he's doing fine.

Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next.  That you might ask -- I'm not certain.

Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.

There are lots of reason... I had a thought that if you had sex with Simon it might...

What do you mean? You said you liked it.

This one has a special meaning.

I can trust my brain.

You don't have to answer everything I say. Just listen to me. Okay?

Were you asleep?

What a break...

Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.

Okay.

You know what? I...

I'm gonna grab you.  I didn't mean it to be a question. I'm gonna grab you.

I'm sorry... I can't hear you. I can't turn my head all the way yet... tell her we can't hear her.

Our room. I don't want to see him and he's not going to come knocking on your door.

I don't think so. You need help with the pants?

Good night.

Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...

What are you trying to do to me?

There's not going to be a debate. You must leave.

Two years ago...

Won't worry about it. You go ahead.

Jackie, will you hand me the mirror?

Yes. Your dog is fine, Simon.

What I know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, I don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show. Are we being neighbors for now?

You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me.

I'm not saying nothing to you.

Concerned. I'm just the hall monitor here.

Yeah. If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules. Good.

Think white and get serious.

Like the wind but I'm not doing it.

Not just today -- Uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet?

You're a wonderful man. Two o'clock is a good time. Here's the key in case he's asleep. Open the curtains for him, so he sees God's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best.

What's he look like?

Maybe this can wait.

Well, that's a load off.

Do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?

Okay, then.

Thank you for walking him.

Get out.

Come on, sweetheart...

This stuff is pointless.

I know. I'm a little bit nervous. Suddenly everything seems so easy. Carol, a load has been lifted.

It was better than this... Look, you, I'm very intelligent. If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I'm drowning and you're describing water.

Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble.

How about that pose?  This is not fun...  Give me some direction.

What restaurant?

Yeah, it's terrible.  I mean Valli, and I don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook.  He probably had it coming, but all the other people.  Real sad.

What's your name?  We both know it's not Nicholai.

We both know what you were doing.

We go around once.

Oh, yeah.

You're too late.

What?

Yes, sir.

The contract was stolen.

Fuck you, fuck Cleveland, and fuck your contracts --

He has to clean up.  How many bodies were there?

I'm part of the game, just like you.

What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?

Turn off the engine.

The nature of the business.  You remove your competition.

We don't have a choice.

Right.

If it hadn't been for me, you would be dead.

He will know everything about you. Everything.  I know, because I've done it.  Once you've been inside a mark's home, you're in their head. If you're any good, you'll find the mark in a week, and Bain is good because I was the best and I couldn't take him.

What do you want to know?

This is crazy.  I can't trust you. You can't trust me.  How can we possibly help each other?

How old were you?

You went from high school to the Agency?

They didn't give you a choice, did they?

Why did you leave the Agency?

They tried to kill you?

Thinking.

Nothing.

What?

Oh.  What do you think about?

Yes.

You can have the bed.  The chair is fine for me.

Why don't you bring it out here? It's beautiful out here.

Okay.  Then what?

That means you won't have a gun.

And with the mikes, I'll tell you when he leaves the hotel and you'll tell me when he leaves the bank.

You'll have the money.  How do I know that you won't --

We split the money?

I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank.  He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.

He said I couldn't win.  That no one wins at this game.

I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I like knights.

I didn't notice them.

How do you know they're not?

Why?

Why?

I didn't want to complicate the situation.

When I gave you my gun and you almost shot me.

What?

What?

The point is, they are paying for information.  Real information.  Not tooth paste brands.  Not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper.  And no 16 hours of recorded phone sex. You are wasting everyone's time with this shit.

Electra --

I'd love one.  Whatever you're having.

Everyone regrets something.

It's possible.

It's a common question.

That's what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?

No.

It won't last, believe me. And you, when will you go back to the States?

What's that? A Democrat with an attitude!

We're only joking.....It is your round though!

You're outnumbered Kat two to one, got to go with the majority, that's democracy.

Yeah, let's check out the low-life.

Yeah and they manage to go to bourgeois joints!

Give'em a break Doug, all it takes is a little work.

Right and not just the bar, Lubosh and his mates took the whole freakin' building.

Maybe, but someone's got to make a stand.

Well, it's like I said, there's a ton of empty buildings around here and most of them were apparently given back to the city, so they're not private.... Now, Jahn here is an drama student at the University. He knows of a building that they were going to turn into a puppet theatre - they even began work on it, until they ran out of money.

Alright I give in. But let's not end up in jail. Okay?

Sure....As for the crap, I've got an idea.

I thought that was part of the charm!

And if the police stop by - what do I tell them?

You're nuts man, Katka's right!

No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.

None, it's mine - you said it earlier, I'm nuts.

And suppose a little old lady lives there?

I don't know Doug, we haven't even got the place together and already you want to extend it.

Well, I think I_ve got a handle on the Czech pysche and I reckon this kind of joint will make _em reminisce about the sixties. Plus we should get a few stray expat_s looking for Kafka.

Sure, I think it_s your turn to buy too.

You should have said it was Bring-A-Bottle.

No beer?

Why don't we go together?

You capitalist pig!

Tell me some bad news?

That bad?

You're kidding.

WE gotta think of something.

I could try and get a Western lawyer.

Lucky break!

You're in the clear, keep it that way, I'll be okay.

I'm not hungry, really.

Good we'll take Josh's Jeep, come on!

That's my mum's.

No!

Have you met Holly? Josh's friend.

I'll take a rain-check for now.

Yeah, maybe.

Alright, I'm coming. It's the perfect place Jahn, thanks.

I hope so!

I'm no good for you Katka, besides I won't be able to stay in Prague.

Don't worry, I've got lots of friends.

So I hear, do you know some of the stage hands?

Well, I want them to put down a floor and a walkway.

Don't go making it too simple, we're on the cutting edge here.

Good, great....Dobchay!

It's perfect, you've done a great job.

Ah, so what?

A month, Jesus! And how do I know you're not crapping me?

What pay-check? You ain't done nothing!

I will tell you - within a week I will have the transcript and we can go through it.

We don't need you.

Well, I've failed at everything else I've done and I can't hack it as a journalist, even for the Bugler.

Yeah, we'd better keep them for now, I'll try and get some glasses for tomorrow night.

I had it coming from someone.

Sometimes.

Uh-huh!

Alright!

It was the biggest I could find.

I lied to you, I didn't destroy the floppy disks.

Not all of them!

A drill, what are you up to?

You don't have fifty foot of apartment!

Maybe it is!

Later.

It's time to go home, Holly.

Go to hell!

Yes, if you can get him free.

The building has been occupied and the locks have been changed.

I don't care about Americans. Arrest them all if you have to, but keep those records secret.

Very well.

I'll tell her you were here.

He wants to show now.

Late night.  You?

I could take after Dad, too.

Landon. You have two parents. We're both here for you even --

Landon, honey. There's nothing more.

Scamming's a strong word.

No. Thanks. Gotta keep my wits for the drive home.

'They won't.'

-- This play means a lot to me.

28 is do something illegal. 42 is befriend an enemy.

Go for it.

And you have to meet my father.

He's a softy. Got him wrapped around my finger.

Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.

Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --

The dirty snowball at its core.

In 76 years, me neither.

My relationship with God is my own.

Sometimes I don't even trust me.

I'm really glad you think so.

That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --

You don't know what you want --

Yeah, with a finish in about a decade.

I heard what you did. Thank you.

We're doing something -- ?

I will.

I'm not going back to school.

I was going to fake it.

Tired.

That was read at my parents' wedding.

Because you have hope that you'll get better?

He wants help with his lines --

No.

Lead man.

Does it have to do with Jamie?

Ever again.

I'd do that --

I'd work backstage or something?

No....

Marty. What's for breakfast?

Oh, I'm feeling much better now.

School? I never thought of school! If I went to school I could blend in with everybody else, couldn't I?

Nine o' clock.  Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.

Marty, you haven't been listening. Nobody's asked me to the dance...yet.

Oh, no, I'm fine...fine.

What drill?

Saturday night's the 'Springtime in Paris' dance. I'm taking Suzy Parker.

Jeez, what do you think? To see it!

Say what you were supposed to say in the cafeteria.

It was Marty's turn to be confused. Huh?

Why?

Why is she gonna get angry with you?

All I can say is, that's one helluva attitude, Mr. McFly. 'Let's explode a hundred megaton Geothermal nuclear device, just to see it.'

Uh -- yeah. I'm new here, and I'm supposed to be in this class.

Operator, what's today's date?

What year?

...To be traveled through

So what? We'd be rich!

Ssshhhhh!

Marty.

You're talking crazy! An atomic blast would melt me and the time machine in a matter of seconds!

You better make sure your old man asks her out, because if he doesn't, they may never have a first date. And if they don't have a first date, they won't have a second date. If they don't have a second date, they won't fall in love. If they don't fall in love, they won't get married, and if they don't get married, you'll never be born!

I brought it with me from 1982. It's from my science book.

Jesus!

Look, Marty, she's not your mother yet. And if you don't go through with this, she may never be. I know it's hard, but there are some things we must do in life that are unpleasant. Some choices must be made that are difficult. Nonetheless, we must make them. Besides, this may be more than a simple question of your own existence, he added. The fate of the entire space-time continuum may rest on your shoulders . Marty tried to smile at him.

Professor Brown grinned. I guess I'll see you in... about 30 years.

Professor -- there are some doors that shouldn't be opened, Marty said softly, without turning around.

1982! March 18, just like we planned! My calculations were absolutely correct! Thirty years! God, I cannot believe it's been thirty years! Sure, it was a long time ago -- longest I've ever had to wait for the results of an experiment!

The Orpheum.

Sure,.

Dick? Dick who?

Dick Wilson? Dickie Wilson? Dickie Wilson runs this place? That's a laugh!

Well, he's gone.

She plays the clarinet, too.

Okay.

Yeah.

I used to throw trash for the City.

You better not leave that Cadillac sitting out here.

Thirty aught six.

Mmmmm.

I need to get your signature on some papers here, Kit.

What're you doing?

For coming onto my property... With a gun.

Yeah? Why not?

What's your friend's name?

You love him?

He'll say that?

There you go.

Great.

Okay, but I'm going to keep it for a souvenir...

I don't want a steak.

Positive?

Really?

Yes.

Wanta sue me?

Rawhide, go find out how Professor Hikita's coming with that formula. Mrs. Johnson, take Casper and Scooter, gas up the Jet Car.

They're stealing my chopper!

Buckaroo, I've done an advanced spectrograph analysis on the specimen you pulled off the Jet Car drive shaft.

Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...

Who put this dirty picture in Buckaroo's viewer?

Boy, I hope so, Buckaroo Banzai.

What? How do you know that?

John Parker, tell them we're doing our best.  Stall.

Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record.  He offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, I...

Do I look like that kinda girl?  I lost my room this morning.  I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight, but I keep going.  What the hell else can I do?  I've still got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, I'll always have a job.

Everybody okay up here?

Who were you really trying to kill last night?

Who?

I'll shoot yours off if I had a gun, you double-dealing Casanova!  I thought you liked me for myself.  But why should you, huh?  A jerk like me.

Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!

What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?

Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.

Course he's alive.  He's Buckaroo Banzai.

Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that thing?

You're thinking of Mr. Wizard.  This guy's an eccentric genius.

She's just a damn road hugger, Allison.  Plus the man can drive.

Yes I am. I'm working on a wres  please call me Barton.

Perhaps you and I could get together at some point also. I'm sorry if that sounds abrupt. I just... I don't know anyone here in this town.

...I know this must look... funny.

What?! He's a son of a bitch!

I'll bet. Jesus  "The grand productive days." What a goddamn phony.

Bill 

Garland, it's me.

What DID you mean?

...Once or twice. His name is Charlie Meadows.

All of us undomesticated writers eventually make their way out here to the Great Salt Lick. Mebbe that's why I allus have such a powerful thrust.

Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting started

Well not much.

To see pap.

Okay Barton, you're the artist, I'm just the ten percenter. You decide what you want and I'll make it happen. I'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism  if I can use that word and Hollywood in the same breath.

No, what did it say?

Well, I'm a writer, actually.

Hell no! Call me Charlie. Well Barton, you might say I sell peace of mind. Insurance is my game  door-to-door, human contact, still the only way to move merchandise.

Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, that's exactly the point. There's a few people in New York  hopefully our numbers are growing  who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the masses that's based on a few simple truths  not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesn't hold true today, if they ever did...

Well, I can tell you some stories 

No, I guess you're stuck with the one you've got. Have a seat.

Not at all. It's damned interesting.

Beery! You got no beef there! He's good.  Hell of an actor  though, for my money, you can't beat Jack Oakie. A stitch, Oakie. Funny stuff, funny stuff. But don't get me wrong  Beery, a wrestling picture, that could be a pip. Wrestled some myself back in school. I guess you know the basic moves.

Well it's... it's a defense mechanism.

Well, it's been better. I can't seem to get going on this thing. That one idea, the one that lets you get started  I still haven't gotten it. Maybe I only had one idea in me  my play. Maybe once that was done, I was done being a writer.  Christ, I feel like a fraud, sitting here staring at this paper.

Thanks, brother. But the fact is, I gotta pull up stakes temporarily.

No... no...

Charlie, I'm in trouble. You've gotta help me.

You gotta believe me 

I don't know! I woke up, she was... God, you gotta believe me!

Have to, old timer. Just for a while.

Funny, huh, when everything that's important to a guy, everything he wants to keep from a lifetime  when he can fit it into a little box like that. I guess... I guess it's kind of pathetic.

Thanks, but I wanted a place that was less...

...Both maybe?

Boy! You writers! Work hard, play hard!  That's what I hear, anyway...

Excuse me?

Yeah.

Nine days  Tuesday 

That's right, Fink, he lives next door to you.

His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.

Anyway.

Give you nose bleeds?

Yeah.

She was there, wasn't she?

Did you find out about her parents?

You know I'm whacko, Sam, what'd you find?

Who?

I thought you quit.

I know the type.  I'm a psychologist.

Did you know Noah Goldstein?

I got married.  He was on staff at the clinic.  I was down in Salinas.  It didn't... last long.

She's evil.  She's brilliant.  Be careful, Nick.

What?

About a year and a half.

Yes.

Yes.

No.  We had a drink at the club. We left together.  I came here. He went home.

No.  I wasn't in the mood to have sex with anyone last night.

Only when they make interesting reading.

I found some in my purse; would you like one?

Yes it does, doesn't it?

I've got a degree in psych.  It goes with the turf.  Games are fun.

No.  Come in.

No.

Yes, you did.  They never tested you, did they?  But Internal Affairs knew.

I have attorneys.  They have friends.  I have friends.  Money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends.

Don't get too cocky.

You can make a mistake.

What's it about?

You mean did I write it before my parents died?

I thought it was a pretty good beginning.

Do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets?  I don't do those.

I told you I had a vivid imagination.

I know.

Did you like her to watch?

What about the other night. What about last night?  Was that to get to know your character?

I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.

Did you miss me?

I'm very good at research.  I'll help you.

What happens to them?

We fuck like minks.  We raise rugrats.  We live happily ever after.

No thank you.

I had sex with him for about a year and a half.  I liked having sex with him.

I'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way I described in my book. I'd be announcing myself as the killer.  I'm not stupid.

Listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you --

Why would I need an attorney?

How's that?

What was the weapon?

Nilsen?

I hope I helped you out.

Rock and roll, Gus.  Johnny Boz.

Somethin', though.

I don't son, but I got the minority opinion.

Well, hell, son, it's got a certain ring to it, I'll say that.

She want to play?  Fine.  I can play.

You oughta use a rubber, pop.  You really should.

That's her pussy talkin' --He gets a real nasty look from a very fat woman eating a cheeseburger.  He winks at her.  The woman looks away from him, shaking her head.

You're my friend, Gus.

Don't you get it, Gus?  If Beth killed Johnny Boz to frame Catherine -- she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at Berkeley.  It gives her the motive to kill Nilsen.

I'm going with you.

What do you want?

She said she didn't know herself, just sort of did it on impulse.  The razor just happened to be there.

Formerly engaged to Roberto Vasquez, deceased --

What now what? Now nothing.  She passed the polygraph.  That's it.

How the fuck do you know?  What is it with you and this broad anyway?

No.

It was an accident.

Maybe that's what you're counting on to get you off the hook.

I'm Roxy.  I'm her -- friend.

Fourteen.  We seal juvenile records until they're deceased.  That's why you didn't find it in your computer.

I don't know.

I like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads...  I'd take some of them out.  I think you're painting too fast. I wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it breathe a bit.

No, I wanted to make a painting of you.

Do you ever get sick of it?

Saddle River's in New Jersey.

I think it's in New Jersey.

Ignorant art?

That's good. At least they're interested.

Wow... Stop giving them away.  I got an invitation to model for Comme de Garcons... You wanna do it with me?

Gee. I don't need to. You're a natural. You should sign up with my modeling agent.

Well, have you asked her to come back?

We can do better. It needed more white.

When I was poor, everybody doubted I could make it. When I got rich, everyone said, `yeah, but he'll never keep it up.' Now everyone says `he's killing himself.' So I clean up, and then they say `Look. His art's dead.' I don't take drugs, anyway. I'm healthy now.

You want a drink?

How about right now?

Sure.

Sure, ok..

I didn't see you.

I'm here.

I hate this. Turn that off.

Decipher?

Leeches. A long list of leeches.  It looks good like that.

Not black.

Yup.

No, he said I was the Eddie Murphy of the art world. He said the Eddie Murphy.

Very well.

Yeah..

Willie Mays.

Would you shut the fuck up? You hear what I'm doing?

Thanks.  Your dad called again  something about a job.

We're getting married. She said she could tell I was a great artist  she could see it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me.

Hey fuck you! I deserve this shit. You're just jealous 'cause it ain't happening to you!

Medicine, man! Like health food. I'm taking care of my health!

Can I walk you home?

What who's saying?

You're blaming me? I had to go see my family.

Basquiat, what did you take?

Well thanks!

He's not. He's out of town and he calls me every day. What's weird about him?

What's that about?

Me? Why?

Wanna Mac?

Life doesn't... make... sense. This city's k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack Marlboros!

You don't even know me. I want real respect.

No, actually I feel worse.

I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...

Yes, I suppose that we did.

I'm -- sorry, I --

But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean it.

I tried to grab you -- save you --

I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.

And it's not even accurate ... I mean, "Batman Blows It"?  The guy probably prevented <u>millions</u> in property damage.

Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.

Nor I, on the second.

Scared of Oswald, are you?  Why, if his parents hadn't eighty- sixed him you two might've been roomies, at prep school!

It does to me.

I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.

Did I?  Only 'cause my mom trained me to, with a man... any man, all men --  Corn dog!

She jumped.  She'd been depressed.

And exactly <u>why</u> am <u>I</u> gonna help <u>you</u>?

That's fine, Oswald.  But to get the Mayor recalled, we still need a catalyst, a trigger, an incident. Like the Reichstag fire, the Gulf of Tonkin.

Well I figured that your password was "Finster."  Your Pomeranian. And it was.  And it's all very interesting, though a bit on the technical side, I mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it's gonna be one big giant...

Uncle Alfred left for America.  Much to my mother's dismay -

Coming on line now, sir.

It appears, sir, that someone has stolen the batsignal.

Hey, I'm the one who kicked Ivy's botanical butt.  Personally.  Me.  I did.

My parents were killed in an auto accident ten years ago.  Alfred has been supporting me ever since.

Whatever you say, lady.  It's all in a day's work for me.

Hey, what's your problem?

You'd be surprised.

Alfred's happy here.

I'm afraid to ask.

I hate being lectured.

We have eleven minutes to stop Freeze And thaw the city.

I didn't kill your wife.

It's the gear.  Chicks love the gear.

No, Robin.  He's going to jail.

He'll be here.

Bad, yes.  Guy, no.  This is one majorly beautiful evil person.

Open Sesame...Chicken.

What are you talking about?

Kill her later.  We've got work to do.

Maybe he melted.

People come first, Dr. Isley.

Well...um...her.

Somehow he survived.  But the cryoslution mutated his body.

Whoa, I made a mistake.  I'm sorry. Don't go all protective on me.  It won't happen again.

I'm fine.  See.  Me.  here.  Alive. How are we gonna work together if you're never going to trust me?

Anybody want to tell us kids in the cheap seats who Joanna Clark is?

But he's never said a word-

I'm late for the dedication.  Then I go after Freeze and Ivy.  Alone.

I knew you could handle it.

Listen, Captain Cold, the suit, maybe, even though silver went out in the 70's.  But those boots are unforgivable. What is it with men?

OK, OK.  Ms. Ivy to the rescue.  Now where do I find your brittle bride?

Not good.

I find that unlikely.

At you?  Polly want a kiss?

I've got to stop him.

What do you mean?

Then you never loved me?

Well, I can respect your opinion.

Hello, Jason.  I think I've had a change of heart.

Ninety-three, including the sauna.

I shall be near at hand. Should you need me. And sir, I know it's difficult but try and have a good time.

Which `they' might that be, sir?

Why, indeed?

As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news.

What?

Recognition, of course.

And you are?

I'm flattered. Not every girl makes a super-hero's night table.  You might have some interesting insights into Two-Face.

It's the car, right? Chicks love the car.

My life's an open book. You read?

Maybe you just haven't met the right woman...

Did Two-Face call him Bruce?

Excellent. See. Who says a guy in a rubber suit can't be smart? Well, it's been grand. Sorry you all have to die now.

Nygma. Edward Nygma. You hired me. Personally. Just like I tell everyone.  Well, we've never actually met, but your name was on the hire slip.

Precisely. What's on all our minds? Brainwaves. The future of Wayne Enterprises is Brainwaves!

What? Oh, Edward. Hi. Congratulations. Great party-

Gracious even in defeat. How vaguely disappointing. When all this could have been ours together.

Banzai.

Actually, I like to divest just before a major re-capitalization.

She's a Malaysian dream warden. She stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams.  Need one?

The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?

Sorry. I haven't even had time to unpack. Instant coffee okay?

Why do I feel like the other man, here?

I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.

Okay, tiger, take it slow. You going to give me your pin or something?

You do know. Try.

You don't understand. It's an addiction. You fight night after night, trying to fill the emptiness. But the pain's back in the morning. And somewhere along the way it stops being a choice.  I want better for you.

How could I forget?

Yesssssss. I know!

Can't tell if you don't say please.

Addictive isn't it? Just Say No. Until I say yes. A little fringe benefit of working with me. Now here's the concept, counselor. Crime. My I.Q., your AK-47. You help me gather production capital so I can produce enough of these  to create an empire that will eclipse Bruce Wayne's forever. And, in return I will help you solve the greatest riddle of all. Who is Batman?

Here. Get a good seat.

Haven't you had enough? Don't Think And Drive.

You sunk my battleship.

Actually, I wanted to talk to Batman. Pass that on to Mr. Wayne, would you?

I know. I called them.

Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures.

Quite a while. I took the scenic route.

Better. It's not on the market yet.

I don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me.

Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?

Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman, I guess.

... Terror.

I said I'd call you the minute I got free.  And I did -- And here we are.

Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --

Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible.

... I know it's you, Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it...

I suggest a nice big bomb.

Sorry.  We had another bat sighting.

What are you talking about?

Gimme a break, will you?  Shut up.

No wonder you're such a chickenshit.  Now shut up.  There ain't no bat.

Oh, Jack.  -- Don't forget your lucky deck.

HA!  That's the best part. I CAN'T!!

Nobody wants a war, Carmine.  If we can't do business, we shake hands and part friends.

Unfortunate, but I think we can work around it.

A visual record, yes.  A before-and- after kind of thing.  This could make your reputation.

Alicia!  Come here, have a seat.  Show Miss Vale why you wear the mask.

Evildoers, huh?  Big or small?

Well, I'm starving.  Will you at least buy me a hamburger?

Why?  Aw, come on, Vicki, I'm a reporter. I'm curious.  I do this for a living.  There's a phone.  You can call him up and cancel.

His face.  Allie, look at his face.

It's gone.

Yes.  Yes.  Sometime.

Tom Jones?

I need some time, David.  A little time.  It's not just you.  It's partly me.

I had the last strawberry in the refrigerator.

It's okay.  There's no one out here. Just open the door.  Trust me.

Hi.....  Roses.

Annie, it's me.

oh dear.

Yes.  I'11 mention it to him.  But ... he's kind of his own guy, you know?

Not necessarily.  That's where this ...  comes in.  No, I've had a better idea than sacking people.  You'll hear soon enough.

Yes, look, I wanted to talk to you about this.  I'm sure we haven't been doing as badly as all that.

Yes.  Ahm.  I was just wondering where my English house guest had got to.

Thank you, sir.  Although, I'm afraid I don't quite see how we can ...

I beg your pardon?

No. Perfect.  Looking forward to it. CUT TO:

Sack him?  David, what else can I do?  This business is not, repeat, not breaking even. And David ... notice anything this morning?

Ahm....

Certainly is.

Ah ... Jennifer, I need you to watch Kevin.  Jen?

Sure did.

Well, Michael Bolton's pretty grisly.

That's one - way of looking at it.  You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'.

Jennifer!  This is not - repeat, not! how we do things in this family. I've told you never to get on one of those death traps!  Please - talk to me.  I promise to be reasonable.

Bye, Bean.  Thanks for everything. And take care, huh?  I know it's insane, but I'm going to miss you.

Okay.....

Nope.

What?

Dammit! I need a TV now! We're missing everything!

Oh, heh heh really? Cool. Heh heh.

Yeah, heh heh. I thought there'd be casinos and lights and stuff.

Me first?

Yeah, heh heh, enough'a this crap.

My butt's bothering me!

Huh huh. Get out of the way, Beavis, I wanna sit by the window. Huh huh.

This desert is stupid. They need to put a drinking fountain out here.

Uh... I think I'm seeing something too. It's like a really long time ago...

Yeah, he had a lot of problems. Huh huh huh.

Uh hey, does anyone wanna see my unit?

Yeah! We're with the bureau of cigarettes and chicks! We're gonna score!

Uh... dill, um, face...

Oh, uh, I mean, uh, ass-goblin...

Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?

Chief, we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly before we arrived.

D.C., Chief.

Damn! Where the hell is he? We should've found him by now.

Holed up. Huh huh huh. Holed.

Are you guys sluts too? Huh huh huh.

Yoo-hoo! Travis and Bob Head. Whoo-hoo!

Well, then you know what I'm talking about. Anyway, here's the story. I scored with these two chicks. True story.

Uh, do you think these two sluts still live in Highland? That would be cool.

Uh, you want us to do a guy? Huh huh. No way.

So do I, Jane.  I'm on vacation.

Oh, honey, I'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home.

How's your arm?

I don't see anything about 'Rewards and Punishments' or 'Heaven and Hell.'  This book reads like stereo instructions!  Listen to this... 'Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.'  This is going to take some time.

Won't?  Or can't?

That's my girl!

I don't know if there's anything we can do.

<u>You</u> left me.

She couldn't have.  We can't <u>make</u> them see us.

That's all we need.

We're not going to wait here like cornered animals.  I can tell you that.  We need help.  I'm going to talk to that little girl.

This is different.  Eventually she'll take someone to the attic. And then what?  We've got to try to contact this guy Betelmyer. We gotta get some help, hon.

Go?  What d'ya mean?  We need help.

... we wouldn't have had our little accident.

I'm wearing contacts... Also I read through <u>Handbook for the</u> <u>Recently Deceased</u>.  It says that live people ignore the strange and unusual... not me... <u>I am</u> strange and unusual.

Wait a minute.  I had some licorice ice cream earlier.  You guys could be gas.  What if... I'm dreaming. Can you do any neat tricks to prove you're not gas?

W... We didn't know how to make one.

D-90's.  You spend a hundred and twenty-five years on earth, actually, in that house, during which you get only three class- one D-90 intercessions with Juno. You probably haven't even read through the manual completely yet.

You wish!  I nearly scored with that little blonde.  I need me a short little queen.

We tried.

We have to start simpler, is that it?

We're...

Hey, I've been in a frigging bottle for six hundred years.  I was out.  Every dog has his day. This is my town.  I need a night to howl.

Are you Juno, our case worker?

What do you mean?  What's he do?

No you don't!  No... Lydia... Why?

Step... mother.

It was gross. They wanted me to dissect a frog. I told them no way.  I said it was against my religion.  I got a C.

And live in what, our station wagon?

Good girrrl!

It's spelled different, but basically... Now you said it twice; just one more time, and I'll be free.  And then <u>you'll</u> be free.

Just <u>say</u> it.



I'm beeyoo-teeful.

What's he going to do?  Viciously rearrange their environment?

My whole life is a darkroom!  One ... big... dark... room.

Stepmother.  She's out torturing the movers.

... sheets.

Otho, can you do it?

They're already dead.  They can't feel a thing.

This is our first meal in this house, Lydia.  Why don't we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one?

I thought I saw something.

Be brave!  Otho take care!  Onward!

Maybe Charles does.

What happened to the people who used to live here?

Yes, but I'm going to live at home.

That's slavery and murder.  You don't know these people.  They're just like you and me.  They're nice people!

I understand. I've seen it done before.

I see.

Yes.

Yes, I will.

Yes, Robert. But it's not bad.

Yes. Ben called me. He wants me to meet the President.

In a day or two, yes.

To everyone, I'm afraid. The Government controls are so restricting that the Medical Profession, as we know it, is being legislated out of existence.

Chauncey is so sensitive... He was overcome with grief...

No. I like this attic very much.

It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.

I like to watch. This is fine.

No. The Old Man died and Louise left.

Thank you, Eve - I like this house very much.

I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man...

Hello, Eve.

Yes. I was.

Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid.

So am I, Eve.

Yes. It's very good, Eve.

Hello, Eve.

Yes. I've been looking for you, too, Eve.

Hello, Sid.

The President is a nice person. I enjoyed it very much.

Yes, that is correct. I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.

Yes, I do, it's very good.

I agree.

Yes, I agree, I think so too.

Yes, I understand.

I certainly do.

Do you think so? Do you think so?

Oh, good.

Yes. I like that name very much.

Oh. When you say 'Your house has been closed', you mean to say that your business was shut down?

Yes, I'm sure it is. That's what they say, anyway.

... Oh?  Robert, take a look, would you?

You're looking much better today, Ben.

A flower...

I like to watch.

Yes. I like to watch very much.

I want to tell Eve.

Yes.

Yes. I like to watch.

I've never ridden in an automobile.

No - but Mr. Rand does have one with an electric motor, that way he can get around by himself.

Yes.

Yes.

Yes, I know the garden very well. I have worked in it all my life. It is a good garden and a healthy one; its trees are healthy and so are its shrubs and flowers, as long as they are trimmed and watered in the right seasons. The garden needs a lot of care. I do agree with the President; everything in it will grow strong, and there is plenty of room in it for new trees and new flowers of all kinds.

I see...

I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors.

Yes. I remember when he came. He was very fat and had short hair and showed me some pictures from a funny little book.

No, Thomas. I have never been in an automobile.

I would like to stay and work in my garden.

Come now, Mr. Chance.

... Hello.

Wonderful, we'll all look forward to seeing you.  Is Eve around? I'd like to say hello.

... I realize this sounds banal but there is no information of any sort on Gardiner. We have no material on him - zilch...

Try again.

Tired... And I'm getting tired of being so tired. Other than that, I'm doing very well.

No, it's been a good day - better than yours, from what I've been told.

Hah!... Tell me the truth, Eve - if I wait until I feel better, will I ever meet the man?

Good evening, Wilson.

Would you two excuse me for a moment?

It's not that, I just...

I really don't know, Tom - he seems so honest and simple... In a way, he's quite charming...

He does talk like one, but I think he's brilliant.

We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov.

There is no information available on the man before he moved into Benjamin Rand's. It has proven to be such a difficult task that it has resulted in the loss of one of our agents to the United States Government.

No problem, Chief.

Right, Chief.

Yes, sir.

Oh? What?

Big business. I could work with that faction quite nicely, Colonel Novogrod.

I'm not convinced of that, Mr. President, but your visit has raised my spirits...

Yes, I did.

It's that serious, huh?

Take care of yourself, Ben.

Okay.

Malkovich!

Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something.

Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning.

May 11th.

I... puppeteer.

Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?

Hmmm.

Hi.

All right. I'll be in my workshop for a little while. I'll be in in a little while. I need to unwind a little.  I'll be in soon. A little while.

I'm scared.

Okay. Maybe tomorrow.

We'll talk about it in the car.

You weren't you. You were John Malkovich.

I've been going over and over my experience last night. It was amazing.  I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't that the craziest thing?

Don't crowd me, Craig.

Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.

No they're not.

What's that?

Yes.

We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.

Life is confusing, isn't it?

Shut up!

It'll never happen, fuckface.

Perhaps you're right. I can't let you go though. Too much has happened. You're my ace in the hole.

I love you so much.

And yourself too in the process. God, you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I see that before?

I suppose. But they got here first, the lousy bastards. So now it's all over, I guess.

I can't believe it. This is too good to be true.

Let me try!

This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.

Schwartz.

I said "yes."

Pity, it tells it like it is. That's why the eastern, read Jewish, publishing establishment won't touch it. That's a quote from the book jacket. George Will, I think.  I apologize if you can't understan a word I'm saying, Dr. Schwartz.

Thank you for being kind enough to lie. You see, I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. You're hired. Any questions?

I wasn't toying with her, sir. I was just... How old are you?

The elderly have so much to offer, sir. They are our link with history.

Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.

Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.

How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!

I wouldn't know.

No, really.

I'm right?

That's incredible! Nobody told me! I swear! It's kismet. Maxine! It's a beautiful name. There's a psychic connection. Don't you see? It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine! Maxine! I will shout it from the rooftops!

Dont let the girly shit fool you. It'd blow your shorts off.

You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.

Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.

I'll protect you, Dollface.

Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now.

J.M. Inc. Be all that someone...

I'm glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it?

And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich.

We saw his show at the Luxor last night.

Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad we can't kill him.

No, for God's sake, I just watered it yesterday.  It almost went well. I gave a pretty good dream, but circumstances arose.

But I think I have another plan.

Do you?

You were stoned. Case closed. End of story. How hot is this babe?

All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.

My child, I don't think its a great mystery what Craig's up to.

You bastard!

Why not? I need to get in there!

That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.

Hi, uh.  Hi. I wanted to place an ad. Yes. "Ever want to be someone else?" No, that's the ad, but let's talk about you in a minute. "Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding..."

I've never been looked at like this by a woman.

After that I'll introduce you to my favorite monkey, Elijah. He's got an ulcer, due to a suppressed childhood trauma. But we're getting to the bottom of it.  Psychotherapy.

I love you, Lotte.

Really? Well, you know, he's quite good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I'll speak with you soon.

Did you see the reviews?

Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.

You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours.

Oh sure. It's very rewarding...

Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.

Yeah. I've figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough, it's all in the wrists.

You mean with Malkovich?

I've got to leave Malkovich.

I just had the most horrifying nightmare. The devil was in it.

Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again.

Derek Mantini!

There was a boy there...said mama was a jailbird...said he could prove it..

No, Stamp. I ain't.

Not like He punished me.

No. I'm looking for what I was put here to look for: the back door.

Beloved..She's mine       I am Beloved

WHERE ARE THE MEN WITHOUT SKIN?

WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHO AM YOU?

Baby, don't be like that.

Don't say those things. You forget about those dreams..

We don't have nothing sweet no more, baby.

No. Got me an afternoon job at the shirt factory. Figure between that and my night work at the Bodwins I might be able to put something away for me and mama.

No. Not a bit all right. Hasn't gotten out of bed since that day.

Thank you.

I'm looking for work. I was thinking they might know of some.

Yes ma'am..

Yes ma'am.

I miss her.

Fine. But what would I do at night?

In case of what?

That was fun.

Morning, ma'am.

Go upstairs I said!!

NO!...She wanted me to do it.

Mama...Mama she's asleep. Why don't you eat something.

He's sleeping in the church.

Can't nobody read minds long distance. All he have to do is ask somebody.

You was friends.

I told him...Showed him the newspaper. About Sethe. Read it to him. He left that very day.

Sure he knew her. Her boy Halle, too.

That's so.

For what?

Well I...I did get offered one place but I just wanted to be off by myself a spell.

What yard? When who-

Yeah. Look bad?

Don't you die on me!! This is Baby Suggs quilt. Is that what you planning!?

I'm telling you don't say nothing to me.

Yes sir.

Plank Road. Yes sir. That's up a ways. Mile, maybe.

What do you think?

Uh-huh.

I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay away from my fucking lady friend, man.

Zere ARE no ROOLZ!

Fuck you.

Come and get it.

Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental house.

I am the Walrus.

Walter, how--

I got eighteen dollars, Dude.

Huh?

YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT!  This Chinaman is not the issue, Dude.

Life does not stop and start at your convenience, you miserable piece of shit.

I told that kraut a fucking thousand times I don't roll on shabbas.

Went alright.  Dude's car got a little dinged up--

Walter, if you can't ride in a car, how d'you get around on Shammas--

They were Nazis, Dude?

Well--

Shut the fuck up, Donny.  This kid is in the ninth grade, Dude, and his father is--are you ready for this?-- Arthur Digby Sellers.

Shut the fuck up, Donny.  Not a bunch of fig-eaters with towels on their heads tryin' to find reverse on a Soviet tank.  This is not a worthy--

They won't hurt us, Donny.  These men are cowards.

I pull over and kick your ass out, man!

Different mothers, huh?

I guess he's pretty, uh, racially pretty cool--

Separate incidents?

Far from it.

Ahh, you know.  Strikes and gutters, ups and downs.

Uh-huh.  Well, I still jerk off manually.

Yeah, well, right man, there are many facets to this, uh, you know, many interested parties.  If I can find your money, man-- what's in it for the Dude?

I FUCKEEN KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!

Hey, relax man, I'm a brother shamus.

Jeffrey Lebowski.

Sex.  The physical act of love. Coitus.  Do you like it?

I like it too.  It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy.

Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance Bunny is one of these.

Take a look at this, sir.

He fixes the cable?

I'm getting to your rug. My  father and I don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, I don't approve of his. Still, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so I'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to.

Here's the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you.  You will receive no bill.  He's a good man, and thorough.

Hey man, why don't you fucking listen occasionally?  You might learn something.  Now I got--

I'm telling you, I got definitive evidence--

Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with.  You can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.

So Dieter has the money?

Maude?

Well, uh. . . Not much to tell.

Uh-huh.

Oh?

Larry Sellers, a high-school kid. Real fucking brat.

Huh?  He's fucking loaded.

Look, Jeffrey, I don't want a partner. In fact I don't want the father to be someone I have to see socially, or who'll have any interest in rearing the child himself.

Yeah man, it really tied the room together--

There's no fucking reason--here's my point, Dude--there's no fucking reason--

Am I wrong!

You brought a fucking Pomeranian bowling?

First of all, Dude, you don't have an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show dog with fucking papers.  You can't board it.  It gets upset, its hair falls out.

Hey Walter--

MARK IT ZERO!

When he moved down to Venice he had to go door-to-door to tell everyone he's a pederast.

Twenty grand.  And of course I still keep the rug.

Yeah.

Huh?

The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have they called yet?

Fuck that!  I love you, Walter, but sooner or later you're gonna have to face the fact that you're a goddamn moron.

Walter, please--

For Christ's sake, Dude.

And what do they got, Dude?  My dirty undies.  My fucking whites--Say, where is  the car?

Well, certainly that's a possibility, Dude--

But Walter--

Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No one is going to cut your dick off.

Now Dude--

No, I'm--

The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.

Look, man, did you--

I understand.  That's why I picked up the phone.

Okay, but how does all this add up to an emergency?

I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye

Three thousand years of beautiful tradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax-- YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I LIVE IN THE PAST!   I--Jesus.  What the hell happened?

Shit, Dude, I didn't know.  I wouldn't've done it if I knew he was a fucking crybaby.

Uh-huh.

Hey, cool it Walter.

Wha.

You're a fuck, Walter!

It's uh, it's down there somewhere. Lemme take another look.

You are approaching a vooden britch. When you cross it you srow ze bag from ze left vindow of ze moving kar.  Do not slow down.  Vee vatch you.

You told Brandt on the phone, he told me.  So where do I fit in?

Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the--

But I do work, so if you don't mind--

Sure!  Fuck it!  That's your answer! Tattoo it on your forehead!  Your answer to everything!

Sure.  That and a pair of testicles.

Bunny.

I'll tell you who I am!  I'm the guy who's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY GOLDBRICKING ASS!

I said out.  Now.

He's half yours, partner.

Someday.

The House of Pain.

Nothing.

Like cancer with a purpose.

You don't have to hunt to do it.

Save it.  I don't want to hear your words.  Let's do this NOW!!!

You put a bullet in my brain.  Wouldn't expect anything else.

Either that or feeding the worms.

Why don't you ask your girlfriend?

Blood...

Ultra-rapid detox.  They use it on heroin addicts, make 'em go cold-turkey in one night.

You need to ratchet those 'nads of yours down a few notches, paco.

Ain't no thing but a chicken wing, buttercup.

Yeah, but you fangs can see in the dark. What am I supposed to do?

Thiavolos, as we used to say in Greece. The Devil.  Pure Thirst.  Nothing more. He was born a vampire, but he is an anomaly.  Like you.  Unlike the rest of us, however, he feeds on not just humans, but vampires as well.

Two so far.

Listen. You have to -- finish me off. You don't want me coming back.

Frost!!!

It's because I'm human that I can do this.

"The Blood Tide".

I'm sorry, I --

Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint.

Like me.

Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute.

Cancer.

Your mother sounds like a Hallmark greeting card.

I'm just tired, that's all. We've been up all night.

I'm not leaving without you.

There's only one alternative to the serum.

Deacon brought me back.

Listen to your father, Jason. It's going to be a better world.

You don't understand. I've killed, I've hunted, and I've enjoyed it.

No problem.

Sometimes --

You're wrong, Dragonetti.

You.

Why? Because we live at another species' expense? Your people farm cattle and veal, don't they? Fattening them up with steroids? It's called evolution, Doctor. Survival of the fittest.

You've been listening in the whole time?

He killed them?

Frost's bodycount keeps rising, and I'm not getting any younger, am I?

I'll take my chances.

Closer.

Bullshit! Talk!

--doubtful, Mrs. Leavitt. The main thing to remember is, whatever the reason, it was for the best-- it meant something was wrong.

--it's called "morning sickness," asshole--

Not the only things missing, Nick.

You know, Nick, you've been something of a total asshole the past few days.

Why is there no "our" here?

Yes.

I want to see the tapes.

Sleep.

Little boys. Looking up my skirt as I danced. Giggling.

--no, you're not. You love me too much. You don't want to see them kill me.

I know, I know.

Yeah.

--no, I think they're all in there.

No.

Oh, who did then? Blair Witch? Snatching equipment to make her own sequel?

Can you zoom it or something, make it real close, real big?

Just let me get my coat off--I had eight cups of coffee, I'm wired for sound here.

--which'd be about ten bucks--

Hey, Mr. Graduate Fucking Thesis here was s'posed to be driving!

I do.

I've got the Panasonic Portable DVD player.

What?

--coming out of the water--

--Cotter: shut up.

Too busy eating us?

Down there in the Park.

Next time try putting on shoes--

What?

--a Wiccan--

It's a <u>serious</u> sociological study.

I dunno it's safe to even get out of the car.

Sorry, I didn't think we were making that much noise.

No one's been in or out since you left. Would've heard the dogs.

One of the printers.

I thought the movie was bitchin'.

Rusty Parr had the right idea on child care.

--and we brought it back with us!

And what's your excuse for being here?

--no.

Okay.

What?

That they'll start touching us inside our heads.

She's off her fucking rocker--

Yeah.

--it's not a could've--there <u>was</u>, Nick. And it fucked up Anna, and did something to Domini, and it caused my father to die, and it's here <u>with</u> us in this place <u>now</u>. And I don't have one single idea in hell what's going to happen next, just that it's going to happen to one of us. And then the other. And then the other. It's going to get into our <u>brains</u>.

I dunno it's anything. It's a name Anna's mentioned--from her dreams.

We're not dealing with fucking logic here!

Or a blood blister--or a bruise.

--the marks appear, then you disappear. Like the little Kurth boy, like Domini, as soon as they come to full bloom--and mine <u>are</u>!

Who <u>is</u> this??

Yes.

Any time. But you don't have to worry about a thing for a while. Marty went down to Corpus yesterday.

No, I--

See a guy.

If that's what you want to do, then you oughta do it. You, uh... you want the bed or the couch?

I couldn't believe it either...

...Mm-hmm.

Abby... you all right?

I cleaned it all up, but that ain't important...

I don't know what you're talking about.

In the trunk.

I think someone's watching.

Lubbock?

Listen, I ain't a marriage counselor. I don't know what goes on, I don't wanna know... But I like you. I always liked you...

I don't know... I just think maybe I'm making a mistake...

Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.

I want that money. If you wanna tell me something, fine--

You called me, I knew they were there, so what do I need these for?

No. It just made them feel better.

What do you think?

I didn't say that. All I said was you're an idiot. Hell, you been thinking about it so much it's driving you simple.

...What kind of fish?

So it would seem.

You said the usual--

No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.

Meurice. Sorry I didn't show last night.

What's that?

What?

Sometimes it helps to talk things over. for instance, many marriages are saved by.

Certainly Frank.  Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?

Shit. let's drink to something else. let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.

You did? A human ear?

Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.

The criminals are winning.

Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.

Yeah.

Yes sir.

We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.

Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?

. my bourbon.

He's a friend. from the neighborhood. we were just talking.

Yeah. but get outta here. He's comin' back.

No way. get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.

Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.

What?

Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.

Then don't talk about killing.

I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from but. I like you.

. same here.

Please. please stay.

What do you want?

No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  . Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. go to the police.

What if Frank came over here and found us?

You put your disease in me. your semen. it's hot and full of disease.

I did. are you?

Oh God, Jeffrey. is that you? Oh God.

It's okay. it's okay.

Don. help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!

Don?. Where is he?

No thanks. what does that mean?

Nothing.

Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?

I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.

You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?

Am I bothering you?

Yeah. What are you doing now?

That's too bad.

Maybe so.

Still, it must be kinda rough.

I don't know. he moved away.

I don't know.

Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.

Pretty clever. Are you game for more?

Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date. that does that.

First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.

Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?

That sounds good.

Well. I've found out some things. nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.

I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.

. Actually. I've been in twice.

Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?

Yes. is that so surprising?. Yeah I worry. a lot. I got you into this.

I like that idea. that's a real good idea.

I can't dance fast.

Let's wait for some slow one.

Okay.

Frank!!

OK. Let's get her over to your father's.

Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.

Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?

That sounds great!

Sure. just a sec.  Excuse me.

What plane?  We going someplace?  Where we headed?  You have your money.  It's all there.  What the fuck is going on?

Motherfucker works fast.

He what?

That's impossible.  We can't be up and running.  Who's distributing?

A toast!  To Mister George Jung.  Mr. I 95, north and south.  My brother-in-law. Happy birthday!

Five-thousand per kilo.

What is?

Oh, they weren't that bad.  I mean, they were kind of cute.

Lawyer says he can plead it down to five years.  I'll serve two.

I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.

Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.

I'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no chance of parole.  Even if they cut my sentence in half I'll be seventy-three years old.  That's some fucking deal.  I don't know if the parole board, the judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself can get me out of here.  I have a really bad record, I'm not sure what's going to happen.

What details?  I put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs.

What?  Yeah, sure.

My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter?

It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss fifteen kilos.

It's your grass.

Goodness is right.  If you do the math, that's over thirty grand a week profit. I want you to be my partner on this, Derek.  Fifty-fifty.  That's fifteen thousand a week for you, my friend.  In your pocket, free and clear.

Don't be ridiculous, these are my babies.

It's in the past.  I'm out of the business now, so forget about it.  No hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And besides, I'm sorry, too.

For calling you a homo.

Oh hey, one more thing?

You have your intrigues.  I have mine. This is a happy day for me, George. Nine months from today, I will be in Medellin sipping champagne.  In nine months, I am free.  How much time do you have?

I would if I could get some sleep.

Congratulations, brother.  I've been waiting for you.

Yeah.  You do the talking.

You're a lucky man, Diego.

The boy is happy, Fred.  Don't be such a killjoy.

You, you big old tightwad.  He still has his communion money.  Tell him, George. Tell your father about layaway.

Yes, it is.

You know why I'm here.  You know what I have to do.  I came here for permission. Out of respect, Pablo.  This is bullshit, he's making me look like a punk.

That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.

...and the winds of destiny carry you aloft...

I just don't know what you're thinking. I don't understand your choices.  You know, the police are looking for you.

Yeah, Dad.  I'm happy right now.

I heard.  Ermine, your son is here.

No.

That was a beautiful message.

What do you guys want?

Figured what out?

The set-up is wrong.  We're doing all the legwork, and at the end of the day, we're still paying retail.  We're getting middled.

Hello.

I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.

Oh, don't be such a fucking hypocrite. I quit smoking, didn't I?

Out.

Oh fucking relax.  Let your hair down for once.  It's your fucking birthday, for Chrissakes.  You're such a fucking pussy.  I swear to G-d, I married this big time drug dealer and wound up with the maid.

Fuck you, George, just fucking drive.

That's right.  Always spying, always judging.  Everyone's laughing at you, you fucking pussy.  You let Diego fuck you in the ass.  Maybe you are a fucking faggot.  You must be fucking Diego because you're not fucking me.

Yeah, well.  I'm working on that.  I've got something going.

Is she here?  George, Kristina hates you.  You fucked her over one too many times.  And I'm not here to socialize. Did you hear about Diego?

How are you doing?

Just to walk with you.  I want to be your dad again.

Not today, George.  Time to go back.

Yes, I do.

Sounds fine.  I'll need to meet everybody.

What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars?  Would that eliminate some of your concerns?

What?

Who speaks Spanish?

You know, he's got a point.  We're fucking Americans.  We stick out like sore thumbs.

Dien Bien Phu?

And here?

I understand. What's your question?

Don't move, Hacene.

They're not paying me anything. They've already warned you twice; this is the last warning. Decide.

You've got to change occupations, Hacene. Right away!

I'll explain.

C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.

Not enough.

Yes, but we must also show them that we still exist.

Good evening, sir.

Fine, Charlie.  You familiar with the Marsh case?

So, what good is it to us if it's been erased?

What good does that do -- it's the old will?

You think the D.A.'s gonna file on Joanne?

Thanks, Mister D.

That's the best part.  She gets it all -- everything.

Yes.

We know Marsh had a head cold.   We found cocaine mixed with water in a nasal spray container on the nightstand.  The coke would contract the nasal membrane the same as any decongestant, but for a much shorter time.  He'd keep using more and more -- never knowing what he was taking.

Can we put Rebecca Lawson at the scene?

Increase his heart rate.

It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.

Yes.

You name it -- they argued about it. Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.

Well -- he died on a Sunday and I have the weekends off -- but they were ripping at each other with both barrels Friday afternoon.

Because she's clever.  Because she knows that even if we didn't find it we'd have suspicions as to why a man in Marsh's condition would use cocaine.

Objection.  Your Honor, we don't know where this tape is from.  Who made it -- or under what circumstances it was made.

I'm just curious to see if Mr. Troxell reconstructed anything else.

Back off, John.

I'm talking to you as a friend now. Don't ruin your life, your career for her.  She'll spit you out when this is over.

I'll rephrase the question.  Mr. Roston isn't it true you are bisexual?

Your Honor, I'm trying to establish a pattern in Dr. Paley's behavior with women.

No.  I haven't done it in years.

I had some papers to pick up.

I assume his girlfriend.

Yes.

Yeah.

About a year and half ago.

Yes -- he stopped smoking and drinking and exercised regularly.

I had bypass surgery.

Fine.  The doctors say if I keep taking care of myself I can live to be a very old man.

What did she say?

Who was your primary beneficiary?

Thank you.  The State rests.

We stopped seeing each other.

Cocaine.

And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson?

I was angry.

That's all Dr. Paley.

No.

No.

No.

What else did the District Attorney's Office tell you to say?

I'm a nurse.  I used to work at Roseburg Memorial Hospital.  Dr. Paley's on staff there.

We dated for about a month last year.

While I was seeing Dr. Paley I mentioned to him one night that someone was stealing drugs from the third floor dispensary.   Three days after I spoke to him in his office he went to the Head Nurse and told her he had witnessed me stealing drugs.

Yes -- cocaine.

What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?

So, the woman he loved passionately was thinking about leaving.  That must cause tremendous anxiety. Sleepless nights.  Incredible stress.

It must have been horrible.  Having to go there -- seeing them together - - knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you.

You don't like her because you were involved with Mr. Marsh before she came along.  Isn't that true?

You resented the fact that she told you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?

Yes.

You see that's what bothers me.  No other bottle of nasal spray was found in the house.  The police looked. There was only the one bottle.  But you say you didn't arrive until after Mr. Marsh was dead -- yet we know he was using the nasal spray prior to his death.  How do you think it got there?

Yes.

Not a very good one I'm afraid.

I'll have you out in a few hours.

We're not animals.

I thought the subject was sex?

I don't know if it's something I can explain to you.

Sure.  Where to?

Because, I'm your attorney.  I shouldn't be going to your house.

No -- it just doesn't look right.

I think the photographer's probably a voyeur.

Oh -- Well, they're different.

It's not my taste.

Not true.  Shall I tell you what you were thinking?  You were wondering if I was wearing anything under my skirt.

Hi.  It's Frank.

No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player.

Yeah.

She's mistaken.

I went out on the boat.

Of course.

I'm glad you have such confidence in me.

What does that mean?  You've been thinking about the case?  Or you thought everything out before you killed Marsh?

Tonight we open new doors.

Fuck him!  He tried to shatter mine.

I'm not leaving without that tape.

How's it supposed to work Rebecca? You and Paley celebrate your victory. You get me over here and provoke a fight so he has to rush in and save you -- but then he's given himself away as your accomplice -- now he has to kill me.  After that I figure she'll tell the Police that you broke in.  That you were crazed because we humiliated you in court?

Why?

-- But it's Sunday.

Mr. Roston?

I am relaxing.

I'm always open to learning new things.

We're supposed to go to the lake.

He must have something or he wouldn't be pressing so hard.

Yes.

I'm not.

Maybe it would be a good idea if you just took Michael.

I don't want our lives ruined because of this.  I love you, Frank.  I want this to work -- but you have to help me.  You have to come back from where ever it is you are.

We have a witness who saw you go into the house at four thirty.

What time did you leave?

I nearly died when we split the bill.

SO!

Oh Jesus.

Doesn't matter. Move on.

Well, there's a lot of boring stuff to do. Lists of people we have to write to. Find mama's relatives addresses in Italy -- stuff like that.

Mr. Peterson, are you sure mama wrote all this?

No treasure maps, huh?

Well, he just gets on about how if mama ever needed him, she could find him through the National Geographic magazine. He as a photographer. He promises not to write again. Then all it says is...  I love you... Robert.

That he be cremated and his ashes thrown on Roseman Bridge.

'82.

I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.

Well, what am I supposed to think?

No. We're going to lock this up and --

Oh, he did not. He's such a nice guy.

Was this during Betty?

I'd kill him. Him and that Redfield woman. Together. First one then the other. And then I'd laugh.

They got heat in Michigan.

Heat is heat.

Oh, shut up! It's the woman who's in control of these situations. Men don't know which end is up till a woman points.

Maybe it's because I live here.

How long you been married?

Oh yeah, Bari. I've been there.

Oh, yeah. Actually, I had an assignment in Greece and I had to go through Bari to get the boat at Brindisi. But it looked so pretty I got off and stayed for a few days. Breathtaking country.

Long.  You just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there?

Oh! You caught me.

No, I'm not.  I don't know why I said that. I've been in a very... strange mood all day. I've never done anything like that before. It's... I'm just...  Well, you know, the whole world is just going nuts.

Want another cigarette?

Not at all.

Richard was in the army. I met him while I was living in Naples. I didn't know where Iowa was. I only cared that it was America. And of course, being with Richard.

Clean?

That's very nice of you. I don't get many dinner invitations on the job. It would be a welcome change. Thanks.

No. I wouldn't say that. National Geographic isn't exactly the hub of artistic inspiration. They like their wild life in focus and without any personal comment. I don't mind really. I'm not artist. I'd faced that a long time ago. It's the course of being well-adjusted. I'm too normal.

What?

I never got lost. For some reason, I'm more at home everywhere than at one place. So I decided I'll think of myself as some kind of world citizen. I belong everywhere and nowhere. I'm kin to everyone, and no one in particular. See, once you get into the habit of not needing anyone, it's kind of hard to break.

I'm a loner, I'm not a monk.

No, I think I need everyone! I love people. I want to meet them all! I just think there are too many out there saying "This is mine." or "She's mine." Too many lines have been drawn. World's breaking apart because of man's weakness for some testosterone conquests over territory and power and people. He wants control over what deep down he knows he has no control over whatsoever and it scares him silly.

Not everybody's supposed to have a family.

I'm a little sick of this American Family Ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country. I guess you think I'm just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without a self-cleaning oven and home movie.

What made you ask such a question?

The cashier at the general store was very dangerous.

I want you to come.

Couple. Want to help?

Actually, no. I've got everything under control. I'd like to clean up myself a bit. I'm going to take a bath. Dinner'll be ready in about a half hour.

Are you hungry?

I sat outside and had coffee.

Near the church.

Because I already tried once.

No, I don't mind.

I had a temper.

Just that it's been a perfect day and that I'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this.

Across the street. She went into the park and got turned around and didn't know her way out.

No.

Yes. Absolutely. You have this habit of not needing and that it's hard to break. I understand.  Of course, in that case, why sleep -- you don't need rest or for that matter eat, you don't need food.

No one's asking you to!

You won't be made to feel! Period. You've carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur, a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you've touched our lives! Well, go to hell! It isn't human not to feel lonely -- it isn't human not to afraid! You're a hypocrite and you're a phony!

What makes it different, Robert?

Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?

Hmm?

Nah.

What's her name?

They're not going to find her!

Alright.  Yes sir.  Anything you say.

Maurice, man, shut the fuck up.

Go for it.

Spooked?

Dad, the man has been lying to us for a hundred years.  I mean, where is my forty acres and a mule?

Unh-unh, little brother.  I got a natural high.  A supernatural high.

Big Bad Eddie Mack?  Got shit for brains and that's a fack.  Hey-heh...

Yeah, but I ain't talking horse.  I'm talking about a five-dollar kick in the head that's a quick ticket to heaven. And the fools keep coming back for more.

Just try it.

All that shinin' and "reader and adviser" mess.  That was your mama's bag.  I don't know about the readin' but you both can sure 'nuff advise.

Must be my clothes line.  No?  How bout my phone line?

I've got what I want.  Turn around baby, look at me.  Look at your man.

They get about twelve and a half minutes. Tops.

Nothing but net?  Could be a swish.  Or a muthafucking air ball.

I have to finish this for class.

You mean as opposed to your life?

Who?  Who is he?  What is he?

Mother!  No.

Yeah.  But when something bad happens, something really bad -- the wall breaks. The fabric tears.

Believe me, my old man'd rupture his spleen if he knew we was down here.  All he talks about is the medal he deserves for building us a life as far from this 'hood as possible.

Don't worry about it.  I'll stay with the boys.

I can't carry it in my pocket, man.  And I can't go get it for you cause you might be a cop.  You gonna have to pick it up yourself.

You were just a kid.

That's the past.  It's dead.

That's it.  Get out.  Now!

You cut him, or I shoot you.  Make your choice.

Now you.

The Gangster of Love don't eat no fried chicken.

Maybe there's a pipe underneath the floor.  It leaked and stained.

I was born near here.  But after my mother died, my dad moved.  I grew up out in Rossmore Park.

We're all tired.  Everybody makes mistakes.  Tomorrow in the daylight, everything's gonna look different.

That you overreacted.  That you lost it.  Not me.  It was your mistake.

Jesus, Caesar!

It was unbelievable!  Un-fucking- believable!

Ummm ...  in the linen closet.

I'm sorry.  It was an accident.

I was getting out of the car when I saw him in the Mercedes.

Jesus Christ, Violet!  Open your fucking eyes!  Johnnie hates me like I hate him!

But you know he did it.

All right, Caesar.

Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've never needed me!  I can't help you! Understand?!  I have to get out.

Where, then?

You need the money just like we do.

I had to.  You made me.

You're blowing your only chance. Act like I'm Gino.

Yes, I understand.

Pretty good, sir.

Are you okay, Violet?

Hey, Mickey.

Yeah, it was Violet's idea.  I was so wound up about Gino, she was trying to help me relax.

Sure, Cease.  They make us do stupid things, don't they.

Ssh!  I can't hear Gino!

Gunfire?  Is this a joke?

...  thank you.

Truck.  Of course.

No, but Caesar does.  He likes him. Says he's a good Italian.

Not exactly.

I told Bianchinni I would take a look.  Is it that sink?

Maybe.

If I say yes, will you take your hand away?

Tell me about it.

You have to ask?

Almost five years.

I guess I wanted to.

How can you sit in that bed and say that?

What are you saying?  That you don't have sex with men?

He was in love with you, right?

That's why I need your help.  You said you were good.

You think I'm lying?

In his office.  I saw it this morning.

Yeah.

Not much, really.  Caesar was nervous, kept cleaning the apartment.  |The first time, he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear.

An accident.

Not Caesar.

It's all right, Violet.  It's working. All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does.

You don't quit on me, Violet, and I won't quit on you.

No.

Violet?

I thought you were never going to do that.

I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility.

I'm not asking.

Our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago.  Even if they stayed in the car, the grid is huge.  This is it.  He's trained -- conditioned -- they're built to disappear.  You give him another day to run and we may never find him.

<u>No you're not</u>.  You're not going anywhere.  I'm shutting this down.

You just blew up a house in Paris! This program is over.  Call it off.

Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...

...headaches...you have that...I get such bad headaches...

Yes.  I mean, I think so.  Yes.  Yes...

I have a passport.  I've got...  Actually, it's a little complicated.

One moment, sir.

Right.  Yes.  Of course.

Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number?

Thanks.



Great.  You know what?  I'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before I start screaming my head off.

Get me out of here.  <u>Please</u>.

I want to go home.

I know that.

I'm sorry.  Really.  What do you want me to do?

What?  Like amnesia?

I fought my way out of an embassy. I climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- I went out the window and I was doing it -- I just did it.  I knew how to do it.

Yeah.  Pull in here.  Park it.

I don't remember any of this.

Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?

-- please -- Jason -- omigod --

And where is he now?  You believe what you want, but I'm telling you the truth -- I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous.

-- how? --

Let's go --  We got to get away from this phone.

xxxxxx

xxxxxx

xxxxxx

I'm gonna find the end of this.  I can't protect you.

-- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off!

Enhance it.

I tried.

Zurich police are looking for an American with a red bag.  Apparently he put two cops in the hospital last night.

-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --

I won't forget this.

I haven't got an emergency. Get out of here.

I fixed it myself.

...elephoned sir.

...ditioning.

... have a look.

...sabotage!

You're putting your talents to very odd use Mr Lowry - yes, odd use - to pit wits against Central Services -

Beginner's luck.

That's all right Mr Helpmann. Glad to help.

Sam, if you've been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you've got absolutely nothing to worry about.

What? - Oh, yes - vividly. I used to wonder if they were real.

Am I?

No, no, I don't. I'm just beginning Honestly. Sorry, carry on.

I'm sure you have

So how ...?

What has Tuttle done?

Very smart.

Why?

{baffled) I don't follow you.

Get her out of circulation - I've put her on the detention list.

What does that mean? I don't want to be involved in anything unsavoury.

Do you know what you're doing.

I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.

I do. Goodbye. 

Bastard!!!

What?

Jack ...

You want Information Adjustments. Different department.

Is it stamped?

You've just said yourself, Miss, we've already stamped it. Why should we stamp it twice?

Ah.

Good!

It had a hole in the floor. Where are we going?

Where are you taking me?

Looking for you.

Things would be worse without Information Retrieval.

Every day?

What?

Get away!

It wasn't supposed to happen like this.

Yes.

C'mon. We've got to get out of here.

Take care.

What a BITCH!

Next of kin!

Well, that's it! I may as well go and hang myself! This sort of thing couldn't have happened before the stupid seventh tier reorganization! That was Simmons doing! And he and Jeffries always sit together at lunch! The bastards!  Ow!  Perhaps we can lose it ... behind the filing cabinet ... or destroy it ... burn it ... eat it ...

Here we are. Pink and blue receipts. All you've got to do is sign these and the back of the cheque.

You are good to me Sam.

What's the matter?

Yes.  NO! You can't! You've only just turned it down! 

This is your dream girl, is it?

Actually, I've decided ...

I know, I know ...!

I ... uh ...

Between you and me, Madam, today the number two.

It's too exciting. I've left Dr Jaffe and gone to Dr. Chapman.

Numero trois, steak.  Monsieur, Mesdames, Bon appetit.

Thank you or calling Central Services. am sorry, due to temporary staff shortage, Central Services cannot take service calls centrally between 2300 and 0900 hours - have a nice day - this has not been a recording, incident-

No you couldn't, sir. This is Information Retrieval.  the lift's arrived, sir.

I'm glad to see the Ministry's continuing its tradition of recruiting the brightest and best, sir.

Fixed itself.

Who fixed your ducts?

Why not? All you've got to do is blow yer nose and fix it, haven't you?

Thermostat's gone. And then some.

Couldn't stand the pa - ah - we're getting warm -

I'm sorry Captain. Don't take it too hard.

You know they won't do it. It's up to you. You gotta be strong.

You swore you'd fire me if I came in late again.

You can trust me on this one.

Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no booze.

Mary ...

I know, but she told me to tell you she wants to crash here a few hours. Terrible about her father, isn't it?

Did you give Mary something called Red Death?

That's the stuff. I call it the Red Lion. Very king-of-the-jungle.

Just take it easy.

I can't hold up my head anymore.

What's his name?

Oh man, do you mean that?  Thank you man, thank you. How?

No, I'd better not.

The first is always the best.

You never know.

Yes.

No.

She should go home.

We moved out after that. Upstate.

How long you been doing this?

You must get a lot of overdoses. I bet you picked me up a couple of times.

I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up.  I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.

No, the city doesn't discriminate. It gets everybody.

I think the worst is over.

He's dead unless you folks want to stop bullshitting me and tell it straight. Then, Lord willing, we'll try to bring him back.

What's wrong.

That's too many.

We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it that way.

Burke. You won't believe it. He's showing cognitive signs. He started with spontaneous respiration, now he's fighting to pull out the tube. Had to sedate him. He's in a CAT scan. I'm giving him every test I can: thromboytics, steroids, nitrodrips, heparin.

What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?

How can that be? He was getting better.

He was tough. You did all you could.

Yes.

No prisoners. Don't worry, Frank, just a little psychological first aid.

Ten-four. El Toro de Oro. Blast off.

C'mon, Tom. The city's burning.

Better bring it all.

What?

I'm not hungry.

What?

Sure, I'm taking the captain's exam next year. After the kids are in school, Louise can go back to the post office and, I thought, what the hell, I'll start my own medic service. Out on the Island the volunteers are becoming salaried municipal. It's just a matter of time and who you know. Someday it's going to be Chief Larry calling the shots.

Used to be my partner.

One more time!

Same old stuff.  I'm watching a man who won three Overseas Press Awards pitch an hors d'oeuvre idea.

You've made my dreams silly.

Can you name all the members of the Cabinet?

We sure do.  I don't mean it as a knock either.  Go ahead.  I'll just say what I think and you can disregard it if you want.

No?

Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?

Can I ask you something?  You only had one crew on the date rape piece, right?

I thought she'd be here.  I'll go with you.

I'll see you back at the hotel.

Yes.

You spend too much time -- much too much worrying about that crap...  Oh good.

I'm not sure I'll be able to...I...

You didn't see it or speak to anybody?

I lost six pounds...

I'm not kidding.

Let me think a second.  It's tough.

Yeah -- being a basket case.

Sit down, stop.

Ernie told this story.  How he used to write obits and when the people in town called him up with death notices, he cried.  He was till that way when they promoted him out of obits.  He says you're lucky if you can get out while you could still cry.  I should have quit this place  three years ago.

Well, we met about three months ago. He works at the surgeon general office. He loves boating.  So, he's been getting me into water skiing.

Your hair's a little funny.

In other times, for other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war.  He...

I'll put him in the low corner of the frame -- good.

I'm gonna go look at it again.

Outside?

Wipe me out?

Please prepare carefully.  This couldn't come at a better time.

We have a minute and a half.  It's my responsibility to tell them we won't be ready.

Well, the visual with the boots at the end was just perfect.

I'll be right down.  It's right tight.

And Bobbie says...

No, I don't think so.

Nobody else had it.

That's okay.

They fired me.

No.  They're firing even more people than they said.  Some will want to talk.  It could help.

Okay, sweetie.

Honey?...

Would it help if I got you a tutor?

I just wanted to tell you  how great you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.

I trust you.

Well, come on -- it is your life. Nobody is tying you to the fast track.  Did you go to college?

And it has nothing to do with the fact I left your room instead of staying there?

Well, I thought I'd check if all of you were still here.  I'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on.

What?

Uh-huh.

Oh, good.

Good.  That's it...See you.

Great.

Because you're nuts.

Oh let's see -- wait a minute, well, I can think of two reasons.

No.  That sounds more important. Let's forget about tonight.

I'll see you at the office.  Good night.

Yes.  Then he said a really weird thing...

That it would be a treat to make someone like you feel better... He gets like that sometimes.

That's yes?

I saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl.  I know you 'acted' your reaction after the interview.

Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it.  I was up all night and...

Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news.

How come you're not chasing it down yourself?

I just might.

I'm going home!

I decided to make a female figure after all!  I want you to pose for it.

Is the manager cooperating?

A thing I made.

Of course...it's wonderful.

You think I'm creative?

What are you trying to say?

Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?

Ok...tonight.  I'll make a statue of you tonight, OK?

Don't you see Carla?  I made them immortal.

I'm honored to know this man.

Oh yes...very nice...very, very nice...

Listen, I'm going over to Walter's after the place closes.  I want to get a look at Murdered Man.  Do you want to come along?

Well, I've been thinking...  I didn't realize how much...talent Walter actually had.  It would be wrong for us to show them one at a time.  Dead wrong.

That's the idea, Walter.  It's the only way to gain recognition. All the big art critics and art dealers would be there, it would be an event.

Well, it all depends, Leonard...

I don't know it was made out of driftwood and dipped in sulfuric acid.  It was out there...

Looks like that cat paid off in spades.

I didn't buy it I made it.

I didn't mean to.

I don't have another cat!

What am I doing?  I'm just telling Walter the truth.

I'm holding for Lieutenant Beldere!

Uh, sure.

Oh yeah that was Mayolia, she's a nice girl.  She's kind of strange, though.

Huh?!!!

C-connection?

Don't give me a hard time Walter! You don't want to get me mad!  You're coming with me!

Turn around!

Yes, get rid of them...

No thanks.  Sounds good though.

Here here!

Why not?

What do you get?

Really?

I can't.  I gotta go home.

Oh no, I couldn't do that.  Mrs. Swicker would start asking questions. She's my landlady.

I want to be part of it, I want to inspire you, I want to do - something!

I'm always alone, Mrs. Swicker, you know that.

Uh, I can take real good care of myself, Mrs. Swicker!

Litter, yeah!

What's with you?

Absolutely.  I see now the error of my mistake.

Oh, yeah.  But I still want to know what happens.

Bummer metaphor.

Would you sleep with them?

You look like shit, Benny.

Get away from here.

Guys.  The environment.  I'm telling you, it's totally key.  The earth is in terrible shape, we could al die, and besides, Sting's doing it.

Don't tread on the earth?

Guys.  Guys!  Reality pulled out of her five minutes ago.

Yeah?

Maybe.

Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh.

I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.

Jealous?

I went to sleep.  I think I have the flu or something.

Have you ever thrown up in the front row of a Richard Marx concert?

No...

Oh, I'm good.  I'm good.  Kind of miss my knees, though.

No, you're not.

Oh, I'll be fine.  Got my chair, got my window, I'm great.

Besides, Oxnard sucks.

I'm going shopping.  Don't try to stop me.

Benny was right.  You guys are all exactly the same.

I'm glad you came.

You say that like it's a bad thing.

Buffy, there's no way you're going out there alone.

Don't be such a fraidy-cat.

You're weird and I'm afraid of you. Seriously, Cassandra, there's a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework.

Please.  They show previews for foreign movies.

Where?

I forgot.

Look, a lot's been going on.  That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you.  You see... a while ago, I met this guy --

I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.

In the past.  A girl.  Maybe... A Magyar peasant.  An Indian princess. A slave.

I have to show you.

Why didn't you ever tell anybody about your dreams?

Just for protection.  You won't have to do anything.  I just need you to watch.

Yes.  They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork.  The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own.  You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated.  Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy.  But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention.

In a way, yes.  Your fate is inexorably connected to them.

Yes, yes.  It would be interesting. A nice cheer.

Don't you see what's happening? You're changing.  You've got powers you've only just begun to tap. Physical, mental prowess you've never dreamed of.  God, this hurts.  I've administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working.  I'm sorry I have to take so many shortcuts in the training process.

Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?

Oh, several.  Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are any of those names familiar?

Oh.

Try to pay attention.

You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.

I...

Okay.  The important thing is not to panic.

That's the plan.

How do you not tread on the earth? I mean, you kind of have to.

Thanks.

Hi.

My parents have money...

Got that.

Oh, baby!

Buffy?

Like we don't have rights too?

You should think about leaving, too, man.  Sell this place... Something's going on here.  I don't know.  Something real weird.

Run.

I didn't say "Crash".  I said Nuke.

You see how nice things are when we go slow?

My right nostril?

I'm really beat.  I need some serious "z's"--

Oh don't be silly.  Death is nothing to be scared of.  It's just another way of living.  It's just a fresh start--kinda like spring training.

Sure.  Unsnap my stockings.

I'm trying to play with your body!

Of course I'm seducing you for Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn poor job of it--  Aren't I pretty?

it's okay..

Don't worry.

He's a virgin.

Why not?  If you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ!  The record's

Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao-Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous.

I want to be had.

I teach part time at the Junior College.  What if I told you I was through with Nuke?  He learned his lessons quickly and left me.

I don't imagine there's much I could teach you.

I said when I think about you, I get wet.

You okay?

I was raised in a Baptist church got dipped in the water when I was 5-- born again before kindergarten...by the time I was 10 I knew it was bullshit and at 15 I ran away from home...

There  might be an opening for a manager at Salem next spring.

Uh oh...  Can I offer you some coffee?

Oh let's not...

Who's he play for?

If you believe in Voodoo.

It was a cocksucking call!

You're a cocksucker!

Now, Nuke, would I do a thing like that?  Hey kids, this is the great Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh.

Shake off the pitch.  Throw what you wanta.

'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem.  You got a gift.

If he had a good breaking ball, I'd respect the shit outta him.

I know, I know--I have that dream all the time.  We're almost home.

Boring.

Shut up.  I'm playing.  Oh you won't regret it, young girls don't forget it, lost in their own wilderness ...  But it's all so easy--Just try a little tenderness...

C ' mon!

I know.  I just like to see you get all worked up.

I don't need a crazy woman in my life.

You too...Meat.

The Crash Davis. ) And you, Larry Hockett, should recognize me 'cause five years ago in the Texas League when you were pitching for El Paso and I was hitting cleanup for Shreveport, you hung a curve on an 0-2 pitch of a 3-2 game in bottom of the 8th and I tattooed it over the Goodyear Tire sign, beat you 4-3-- and I got a free wheel alignment from Goodyear.

From what I hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot

We'll be praying for you.

Can I give you my testimony?

Some kid hittin' .300 in Lynchburg ...probably a bust.

Jim looking for somebody.

...he did what he was told.

I can't believe you're doing this.

Hello, Senator.

Was I at that dinner?

Yes, you were.

It's a pity in this...

These guys back home don't give a fuck about the Supreme Court and any of this bullshit! They want things to quiet down. They want you to walk away from -

Watch it, partner, watch it!

Look, Gin, you know I got other people in this. I got partners. But I want you to understand that I am lookin' out for you in this thing.  Okay? You're going to get yours back... and you're gonna get it back first. Okay?

Yeah, sure I do. Why?

Okay.

Help, Daddy!

I can't! I'm tied!

You know, I don't know if I could do this even if I wanted to. The Gaming Commission would never give me a license. I have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.

You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.

And, Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known.

It was typical Ace. He invited the biggest people in town and he knew they'd show. Because he knew they all wanted somethin' from him.  With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride. Even Ginger. With her -

Okay.

Hey, Rich.

It's impossible. It's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation.  It's...

Well, it's okay. I'll use the service entrance. I'll see you at nine.

Hey.

You mean, quiet like this: 'I'm the boss.'  That's quiet?

Yeah.

Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident.

No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point.

It's none of my business?

Fuckin' walking around with a big head. You better check yourself...

Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's right.

No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told...

Yeah, she's with that cocksucker again... and they got Amy.

Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch.

How do you do?

No, that's quite all right.

No. Just stop everything.

Nice to see you, Senator.

I don't care what she is. She's an institution, that's the problem. She's lazy.

L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']

Who's this?

She was a queen around the casino. She brought in high rollers and helped them spread around a lot of money.

Thanks a lot.

I'm gonna do you one better. I'm trying to marry you. You want to marry me?  I'm serious. I mean, I - I want to settle down. I want a family.

Yeah, I know all that.

You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.

I'm not crying. 

I'm okay. I just -  You just have to understand. I've been with Lester since I was a kid. I just wanted to say goodbye. I - I just...  I don't... I think I have a right to do that. Okay?

Uh-huh.

Look - Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this.

That's all you care about.  You don't care about me at all.

Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.  Okay... I'll try. I'll try.

We had a deal. Remember that?  He said if it didn't work out between us, that I could get my things and I could leave.

Yeah, they're gonna kidnap my kid. What do you want?

Uh,  I don't know. I gotta tell you, I don't know.

I under-understand that. I-I know I fucked up.

With what?

First of all, he's not gonna wear f- thousand-dollar suits. But let's say he did, which he won't. How you gonna get fitted for twenty-five suits in three days?  I, um, I mean, how could you get fitted that fast? I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much.

Would you knock it off, Sam?

Come with me now! Come with me now. Come with me now. I want you out of here.

Let go of me! Let go of me!

You're stoned. You're a junkie. Get out of here.

You know why I want to do it. Just do it.

You want your jewelry?

I am calm!

What are you running for, Bob? What are you running for?

That's amazing.

Well, it happened so quick. Three guys won. I didn't have a chance to call you.

Well, it's a casino. People gotta win sometimes.

That was nineteen years ago, and they were simple gambling pinches.

Can't do it with both hands?

All right, I'm gonna give you a choice. You can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here. You can't have both. What do you want?

What?

Mm.

Yeah?

I don't want to go to Europe. I want to go to see The Elephant Man.

Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.

Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.

I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark?

What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?

He won't...

I understand.

She's on the account. There's nothing we can do.

Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you!

Yeah?

I did - I didn't -

Fuckers!

Carmine's gone.

I'm over here now.

Well, listen, uh... Good luck with the joint, huh? 

I'll take care of it, Remo.

I know.

Because there's one thing about these old timers: They don't like any fuckin' around with the other guy's wives. It's bad for business.

Hm.

I understand.

Keepin' Remo happy with money was the greatest insurance policy in the world.

Mm.

Pleasure.  Very nice to meet you.

Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so... so what?

I should have never married him. He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini... duality.  Gemini's the snake. You know you can't trust the snake.  I mean it.

Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. He's jealous and worried.

Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him.

Yeah.

Mm-hm.

He really thinks who the fuck he is, I'll tell you that.

Yes, you are.

Come on. Don't be scared.

Yes, I will. It's what you want, isn't it? Huh?

It's what you want?

Get the fuck out of here. Get out! Get the fuck out!

I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.

Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  Thank you very much. Thank you very much.

That bag's full of fuckin' chips you

You are.

You do?

It means I got the money.

She started it. She started the whole thing. I'm just standin' here.

No, I'm gonna drive.

Listen...

Are they out now?

God, I'm telling you, they're out!

Hey. Hey, Sammy, how are you?

All right.

Two.

Get up.

What's takin' so long over there?

What, are you gonna have a fuckin' meeting here, or are you gonna buy some diamonds?

She asleep?

...to a tee. Like the time Tony Dogs...

Let 'em complain. I'm the one who's here.

Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?

I don't trust him anymore. But they'd never okay anything, you know?

Yeah.

Dominick said they're in the motel?

Fuck you, you motherfuck!

Your fuckin' head, huh? Don't fuck around, Tony.

Denying?

I'm sorry.

I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'.

I'm sorry.

Then do it the way you want.

Having a good time?

Sorry, sir. The Cult is my life and my life is the Cult. By God, Captain God, I shall not fail you..

It's okay. Let her go.

I don't know about you, guys, but I'm getting a little buzz off this.

Stop. We are not having a "duality" conversation. "Ooh, he has a secret side.  Ooh, she has a dark side." Please.  Duality is a joke. You get one, do you understand me?  You get one life. One shot. I'm so tired of women saying "I have an inner strength" or "Deep down, I'm really ambitious." "One day I'll design my own line of clothing and write children's stories, if I can only remember to return the videos I rented last night." If you are something, then you better be out there doing something.  You need to be the same bold thing in the day that you are at night--with maybe a slight clothing change. There is no gray area. The truth is not somewhere in between. There are two sides to every personality, all right--the reality...and the lie. We are not having a "duality" conversation.

I got home fine. How's the "warehouse."

Uh Brock, today you are without me...

It would be honor, Brock. Now let's go get this guy...

She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?

It may be time to get the police involved...

I've been looking for you.  Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader.

I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that...

You were right all along--the two parts to a person are the reality and the lie.  I was making good money as a top architect--but that's not who I am. I'm not an architect, I'm a..

I hate innocent bystanders.  Whine, whine, whine. Will he settle?

That is not a man, Captain God. That is Vomit accidentally born with two legs.

I know how you feel, humiliated in the hands of a woman. I'd rather eat my soul on a paper plate...

A bit sadistic, don't you think, Captain...?

Oh, I like her. I like her a lot. I want to save this one for later. Something that tasty you don't eat all at once. Go back to your alter- egos, we'll regroup in the morning.

Of course it matters!  It throws off everything!  "Superhero" is manhood's highest achievement. Manhood!  Your dirty little secret has diseased us to the core. You were my buddy, my comrade-- women aren't buddies, women aren't warriors!  You tried to turn the Cult of Good into some after-work softball team!  It's time to get thrown from the treehouse...

I know.

It's a lot more fun than fighting violence with pamphlets. That voicebox of yours is a hoot. Say "I'm wearing no underwear"--it'll be funny..  You do know you're evil, don't you?

You mean, "Consuela" is a good mother..

What's the good news?

Oh Frank, I'm not anti-male, I'm anti- you. Believe me, there's a difference.  Kelly is designing new uniforms for next week. Pay her and thank her. And is it a rule that the hottest places on the planet have the coldest air conditioning.  There's something out there called 73 degrees, look into it.

But of course you are.

Fine, fine, at a later date, I'll be more than happy to talk about my perverse psychological complexities with the one who's not the creep. But for now, I'm drilling inside your brains...I bring up the whole Catwoman thing for one reason.  I bit Captain God in the hand and the next day you both show up equipped with big bandaids and wobbly excuses--  "My grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender.."

"I'll go out with you." Now go get me these old newspapers...

It's because I didn't come in. I live in the Hut, now. I meant to tell you..See ya.

Trust me, you won't have to.

This is one way.

I don't see anybody in there but you.

I didn't hurt you.

Me, he won't stay on the phone with for five fucking minutes without bitching.

He's at it again.  Like that night at the Emerald.  This piece of Euro-trash is slapping shit out of his little wife in a back booth -- so Mr. Good Deed here has got to step in and pound the fucker's head into the wall.  Meantime "Wifey" recovers enough to pull off her high heel and nearly take our hero's eye out.  It took six stitches.

Look -- I've got the lives of maybe three innocent people hanging on the end of this line.

I'm sorry.  You'll do all right without me.  Keep my share.

You could've killed us.

I'm not staying in here with him puking all over the place.  Get this door open!

I'm going to level with you officer.

Can you make him stop!

It's taken care of.

Not this minute.

Wait!  I hear her breathing now. There, she just picked it up again.

Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.

I improved on the fucking original.

Allow me.

I'm still in my cab -- jammed up in traffic.  Are you there yet?

Give me 20 minutes at least.

I've been trying to get someone -- anyone.  For hours ...

You don't understand.

I realize you don't want to be involved.

I have no idea.  They put us in the back of a van with blacked out windows.  The shutters up here are nailed shut.

No!  No police.  They'll know right away the authorities are looking for us.  They'll kill us. We've seen their faces.

Elliot -- our driver.  The officer put his gun to the back of Elliot's head and -- fired.  It was so quick.

Rachel, my daughter.  She's an honor student at Parker.  My God, she's only nine.

They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.

Just hang on.  I've got a life of my own.

How much time do you have left on it?

They say my work is somewhat derivative.

Lady, you don't have to keep up a running commentary.

That makes two of us.

I've lost you.  You're gone.  I can't hear anything.

What do you mean?

It's not hard to do.  I do it all the time.

Don't talk.  Don't talk!

When they first started questioning Jack -- he answered them in that tone he usually reserves for me.  And they began beating him.  And I watched.  And I didn't feel anything ... What kind of a person am I?

Yes -- I think so.  Another crossed line?

Lucky for them they didn't.

Are you okay?

Your husband?

All right.  Now that you explain it I see that you're right.

You're going to let them get away with this?

They tortured us.  And you're going to let them have all that money?

It belongs to the man you took it from.  Or should I saw <u>stole</u> it from?

I thought it was inspired.

Why pick me to be your "mark?"

L.A.P.D.

You won't shoot me.  That's not your style.

The one thing you don't want is to attract the police.

Oh no, you were too busy trying to keep some Croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend. She showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel.

You wouldn't --

259-7881.

I was sentenced to a youth camp out here when I was fourteen.  We cleared some of these same roads.

That's where this Chicano correctional officer first taught me to slap paint on a canvas.  I could copy any fucking thing he put in front of me.

We can't leave him to repeat anything.

Only one way to find out.

Take your hand out of there. Slowly.

Pull over!  Pull over someplace.

Toss them -- one at a time.  I don't want to lose count.

Who is this?

You got time on your side.  Pretty soon they'll be missed and we'll have the law up our ass.

It's a nice day.  How about the beach?

Take my number.  When you see me -- call me and I'll walk you through the exchange.  It's 308-9962 -- Repeat it back.

We don't see you.

Stay there.

She's yours.  What are we waiting on?

Don't worry.

What are you planning to do when they got here?  They'll kill us. They'll kill Rachel.

If you're looking for a quickie all you've got to do is ask.

And if you ditch us we get zilch.

The fuck I will!

I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.

Nels!  Guess who?  A friendly voice from beyond the grave.

Stay put!  I know my way around.

Nobody can do anything right but you!

Who are you?

Your partners are currently armed and we're not.  Our edge is that they don't know we're in touch.

Yeah.

Is that good or bad?

I'm sorry.

How?

Did he?

What do you think his name is?

Ask him yourself.

Cunt.

Take your fucking goldfish, too!

Fuck off, Dave.

Yeah. I heard. You hear, Jimmy?

She's not a tart.

Consider it how you like. Just get that bloody tart out of here.

It's a simple question.

What's it to you?

The accent, I suppose.

Must be.

He wants me to perform for him.

You can't leave me then, can you?

No, I didn't --

I wonder.

Jesus fucking Christ.

Must be in love to manage that.

Tell me about him.

Yes...

Maybe.

What is this?

I'm thinking of your man.

All the time.

No...

Don't call me that.

I said stop it.

You think that's wise?

Ask to meet me again.

So they do know.

You can always pretend.

Only if you kiss me.

Kind of.

Why shouldn't I be jealous?

I can't.

I'm not sure.

More than that.

No. Sit down.

Yes.

No. Want to make you into something new. That nobody recognizes...

Sorry. What you doing?

For me.

Look on it like a honeymoon.

Only in times of extreme stress.

You knew which man?

You knew my Jody?

No.

I suppose I tried.

He asked me to see were you all right.

I asked you a question, honey -- were you there too --

I promise.

The Metro.

Stop it, Dil --

Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?

You're back in the pink, Tommy? How're you keeping?

Someone's got to do it.

My pleasure.

Jesus, Fergus, you're a walking cliche. You know we won't leave her out of this. But I'm glad to see you care.

Was I?

Yes?

Get that thing off me, Fergus --

Do you want a cup of tea?

He described me down to a T. Knows what Jude looks like.

You'll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me?

Would make me feel better about it.

Just a girl.

A hotel?

No fucking way.

No. It's the truth.

Do what?

And you know the funny thing?

I didn't even fancy her.

She's not my type.

Tree.

Hurry up, would you?

Want you to do something, Fergus.

I don't know her.

Yeah?

Tell me something, anything.

No, fuck the bear. The name. Jude. And it's June. Jude in June.

You'd know I wouldn't run off.

Tell me, Jody

Who gives a fuck.

You shut your face --

He's a good soldier, Jude.

That true, Fergus? You in love?

I think that's what you ordered.

That's right.

Relax -- you're gaining.

You're going to look for him -- now?

Adam --

I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --

Lord, you're stubborn.

To the apartment -- it matches mine perfectly.

Well, I guess that's it -- dead end.

Think, Reggie, you've got to think -- it may be what we're looking for.

Five o'clock -- Thursday -- the Garden -- it's got to be something around here.

Stop grousing. If we find the money I'll buy you an international conference all your own. Now start looking. You take this side and I'll poke around over there.

Look.

I'm through listening to you!

No!

You lied to me so many times --

Can I really believe you this time, Adam?

What makes you think they're even interested? It's only a quarter of a million -- it'll cost more than that to fix up their bookkeeping. As a taxpayer --

Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.

No thanks.

I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?

What's all this got to do with me, Mr. Bartholomew?

So that was it.

Danger? Why should I be in any danger?

Oh, I see.

Well, there you are! Charles had the money with him -- so whoever killed him has it -- they have it!

Because they're still here.

What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?

Describe him.

Barely, yes.

Gratinée, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.

Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then?

But no one actually saw him die.

Me? Why me?

No, I do -- it was the stamps on that letter Charles had with him on the train. They were in plain sight all the time, but no one ever bothered looking at the envelope.

The last one, please.

Herman Scobie. And you've never seen him before, either?

We're not allowed to tell. May I have the stamps, please?

The lunch hour. He probably worked it out in advance. He found an office that was usually left open and just moved in for the time you were here.

Who asked you to get stuck with any of them?

How about if next week some time I put it on a marriage license -- that ought to --

You're out, Dyle -- right now!

I'll take that.

No cat and mouse -- you've got me. What do you want to know?

The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans, but I think they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie -- and your husband -- because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. I'm trying to prove it. They think I'm working with them. But I'm not, and that's the truth. I'm on your side, Reggie -- please believe that.

I met a man with sharp nails.

Would you like to see my passport?

Okay, I'll drive you around there some day.  Ouch!

Yes, but we're divorced.

Reggie -- listen to me --

Okay.

I don't know -- it depends on whether or not they've already eaten.

I'd better call Sylvie -- she must be frantic.

Maybe.

A) It's always the person you don't suspect; B) that means you think it's Tex because you really suspect Gideon; therefore C) if you think it's Tex, it has to be someone else -- Gideon.

What -- like Scobie?

I'm sorry.

No, about Scobie, I mean. I can't think of any reason why he was killed.

What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex -- that means we're in his way, too.

No --

Let me know what you want -- I'll pick a suit that matches.

This is a ludicrous situation. There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower.

I dare you.

Shut the door!

What's its value today?

No. For a few minutes they were mine -- that is enough.

That's right -- it's like ticklin' a alligator's belly.

No. The police have kindly provided us with a list.

Leave me alone -- !

I'm very confused.

He didn't have one.

I wish you wouldn't.

Is that all? Can I go now?

And this? And this?

In Mr. Dyle's room?

No, Jean-Louis.

I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do you know where this Monsieur Félix lives?

I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.

Quitter.

You give up awfully easy, don't you?

I'm a simultaneous translator -- like Sylvie, only she's English to French -- I'm French to English. That's what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him.

You telephoned me to meet you. I've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you.

Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.

No, everyone. Come on -- avanti, avanti!

I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.

How would you like a spanking?

But he didn't! I've looked everywhere --  And if I don't find it --  Those men going to kill me.

I believe what he said.

Don't put yourself out.

Don't make too much noise, Miz Lampert --

Yes, ma'am. A little one -- 'bout seven or eight years old. Th' little tyke keeps callin' you his Aunt Reggie -- ain't that cute?

I don't know.  But if this is a sample of American diplomacy I'm buying a fallout shelter.

Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.

We want that money -- now!

I think I know how to restore your reputation.

WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress?

Not my imports.

That's impossible.

Daddy you scared me!

It won't happen again.

Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends!

Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler.

How much further?

It can't be.

Never mind darling. You go back to school. I don't want you missing anymore classes today.

No I wasn't.

The same type that decides to carve into her stomach.

She just turned off her light.

She's still a virgin.

I don't give a fuck what your reasons are. You pay me ten dollars, you can go inside Otherwise, get a warrant.

Couldn't tell she going to off herself, huh?



Daddy....

You're not?

No. Hell, it's the quietest goddamn party I've ever seen.

What are you doing here?

I knew you were a pervert. Always wearing those fucking doofy glasses, and driving a station wagon.

You know about that too?

Because of your father. The way what his sins shaped you.

Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?

I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one.

Who?

Why?

You're going to look really amoebic splitting off from me now.

OK. increase the peace.

There will be a lot fewer by tomorrow night.

The phone just went dead. I called the police and ran right over as fast as I could.

What party?

I can't right now.

Not at all. In fact, I thought about going.

Yeah. I think it's really sick.

No I'm really grounded. When I got in late the other night, my father was waiting up for me.

Let's just start a party right here, right fucking now.

Sharon's far from a slut.

Jody, you're only doing this to get back at your dad. It doesn't have that much to do with me.

I love you.

Hi princess.

No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.

The library. I'll be fine.

Who was the fourth?

Just thinking about something.

I got to go.

I'm worried about someone.

Told you to hide it.

But you don't really mean it.

What?

You're being unfair.

Yes. Unfair to me.

ROD!



INT. ICE CREAM TRUCK/CAB - DAWN.

INT. ANDY'S ICE CREAM FACTORY/ANDY'S OFFICE - DAY.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY.

INT. GOMEZ'S HELICOPTER - DAY.

...two things Andy is not.  Uh, but I tell you what.

...ya?

Peace.



I got, like, uh....

Hey, you're gonna piss me--  What the hell are you supposed to be...

Yeah, to keep him off my ass.

I'm gonna bust a mudhole in your ass. I'm gonna--  Don't tell me to shut-- It's none of your business.  Man, I can talk all I want to.

Are you kiddin'?

...all the time.

...excuse me.  Can you fix this?

No, you gotta go to McGrud-...

No, no, no, no, no.  We gotta go to McGruder!  I go where the truck goes!

Fine. 

God-...

Doesn't work.

Doesn't...

Hey, take a look at your situation and...

...you.

You  snatch that  phone  from me one more time, I'm--



Eight and a half feet wide!  Weighs over five tons!

I don't think we have much of a choice...

Oh, shit.

...you crazy bastard.

Shit.  You gotta pass him. 

...yeah.







What?

...or nephew or some good old boy...

You know.

I mean, if that gun was...

...man.

Bring him down!







Sometimes the prey bites back.

...-ful?!

Forty-five seven!

...they come!

Tunnel.

Whoo!

What do you think I'm doin'?!

 

What?

 





Excuse me.  I got a bullet in my leg.

Thank you.

Oh, oh!

Yeah.

To tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist who's gone missing from the Tech Center.  Maybe you know him. Richard Long.

Listen, shithead!

I don't ever wanna see another ice cream...

Oh, my God.

This country trained me to kill...



Mason, you have to take this...

Wait.  This town is full of trucks.  Nice new trucks.  You don't need to go...



He's the dude...

If you're right, Lewis, this Mason is one hell of a pro.  He must have a service record and a paper trail some-...

You know, captain, if you hadn't spent so much of your career questioning your superiors, you might've found yourself with more gold leaf on your col-...

This isn't some kind of pissing contest, Long.  You may be in charge here, but those men out there are my responsi-...

Look, this is a scientific experiment, okay?

It's too...

There's nothing to say, doctor.  Someone had to take the fall, and they still need you, whereas...I've never been anything more than a thorn in their collective side, as you once said.

...not at all like a man responsible for the deaths of eighteen peo-...

Is that why you're here?  To blame...

Do you think I haven't seen the bodies of those...

So far, ye-yes.

Well, Lieutenant Vitelli.

INT. BRYNNER'S VAN - DAY.

INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY.

We're in.

...-ther orders?

Stay put.  Keep the camera trained on...

Officer Pappas, I'm glad you're here.

It's a hundred degrees...

...though.

You try anything, it goes in...





Be sure you feed Bosco.

...ready before the morning crowd blows in.

Oh, you're two of a kind, doc.  Oh, he may not have your sheepskins, and...

There's something else too.

You got thirty minutes.

INT. DARLENE'S STORE - NIGHT.

Kabula's out.

INT. TUNNEL - DAY.

INT. TUNNEL - DAY.

All right, let's move...

Negative.  Negative.

Pappas, that other guy was unloading ice cream into a freezer.  Now, what could he have to do with a military scientist, huh?

Uh-huh.

Yeah.  Ten months we've been fishin' this river together.  We use the same equipment, more or less...

He's brains without ambition...

Everything will die, Mason.

Doctor.

We've got the real thing!

I didn't sell the boy any...

You know, I gotta tell you.  That really bothers me, somebody calls me "son."

...there's a colonel...



The Army, sealin' us in.

Heat's murder.

It doesn't hurt.

No. She happens to think the last one was murdered.

Of course, but you've got no reason to think he's bungled the case?

Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.

Just find the girl, Mr. Gittes. I think she is frightened and I happen to know Hollis was fond of her. I'd like to help her if I can.

She's fine.

With her mother.

The future, Mr. Gittes. The future. Now where's the girl?... I want the only daughter I have left... as you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.

Either that or she'll be in jail.

I think I'll kill her.

I don't know...

Plus what I owe you?

Jake, listen.

No. The albacore. It's a fish. My grandson's a member and they take very nice care of us.

Summer colds are the worst.

I get by.

Oh yes.

No.

What pictures?

I heard it was an accident.

Well, I hope she wasn't too much of a disappointment to you, Lou.

Shut up.  Go on.

Her maid's house. I think she knows something's up.

What for?

Gee, thanks, Lou.

Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.

Jake, you're very disturbed. You're crazy. That's her father.

Do you know where she might be?

A private investigator?

Yeah. Fine, thank you.

I don't want to drop it.

I'll stop by.

It wasn't much of a lie.

But he wasn't killed.

Where you were when your husband died.

You mean you don't know where you were?

Wait a minute, sonny.  I think you better come with me.

Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that I don't know.

Yes. He never forgave him for it.

Of course I'm sure.

Before this I turned on the faucet, it came out hot and cold, I didn't think there was a thing to it.

Is that unusual?

I gave everybody the night off.

The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?

Your eye.

That you were jealous, and he was worried about what you might do.

She's not tied up!

...That's not what I meant.

What did you do that for?

I don't know. I mean yes, probably.

She's my sister and my daughter!

I have to go home and get my things.

Where can we go?

Okay...

He's in the dark room.

Yes, Mr. Gittes.

Yes, Mr. Gittes.

Three reservoirs. Men's room of a Richfield gas station on Flower, and the Pig 'n Whistle.

I think I got something.

A Miss Sessions calling.

Nothing to do with Dad. It's me, actually.

I don't think so. Be happy to show you.

Help yourself.

Hope so. He's working for us.

Neither do I, actually. But you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me.

Yes...

So how are you, Morty?

Yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in the bottom of the riverbed.

It's not completely dry.

Yeah.

I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. I can't do everything myself.

Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.

Yeah.

All she needed for that was the phone book!

I don't want Mulvihill.  I want the big boys that are making the payoffs.

I'm going to see a man called Julian Cross. Ever heard of him?

She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.

So I can have these? 

Come in, Alfredo.

What you say is wonderful! But sad...

Father Adelfio, I have a very serious doubt that is torturing my soul. And you've got to help me, because I've lost all peace of mind...

Don't be silly...I'm old.  Don't look at me like that, please.  Why'd you come back?

One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores.  I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?

It's not true! No! It's not true!!! I'll show you he's coming back!

Well, it's hard to call an important person by his first name. But if it really matters to you, I'11 call you...  Toto!...

The food is marvelous in Cuba the senoritas are beautiful stop I could send you prose poems of palm trees and sunrises and tropical colors blending in far off landscapes but don't feel right in spending your money for this stop there's no war in Cuba regards Wheeler.

I didn't see that.

I can't take shorthand.

Ready for dinner, Brad?

Oh!

You're right, Mr. Bernstein.

Two hundred and one thousand, six hundred and forty-seven.

Sit down, everybody - for heaven's sake!

You don't really think so?

You and Leland and Mr. Kane - you were great friends back in the old days, I understand.

I'm calling on people who knew Mr. Kane. I'm calling on you.

Well, I went down to Atlantic City -

He made an awful lot of money.

I guess Mr. Kane didn't think so well of Susie's art anyway.

It didn't end very well, did it?

It's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it -

Charlie?!

That looks pretty nice.

Certainly not.

Certainly not.

I wanted him to have fun - and with me along -

Yes.

Hello, Bernstein.

Mr. Kane is finishing it.

Ask them to sit down.

I don't my plans myself.

That's one of the things I think must be changed, Mr. Carter.  The news goes on for twenty-four hours a day.

Because we're running a newspaper, Mr. Kane, not a scandal sheet.

That'll be all today, Mr. Carter. You've been most understanding. Good day, Mr. Carter!

Has he said when he'll finish?

Thank you.  I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly mistake.  The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle -  I suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her.

I'm surprised he got the votes he did.

Maybe I should have - the first time he showed me what a mad dog he really was.

But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.

You're a cheap, crooked grafter - and your concern for your children and your mother -

I don't see what else you can do, Charles.  If he's right - and the papers publish this story he has -

You decided what you were going to do, Charles - some time ago.  You can't always have it your own way, regardless of anything else that may have happened.  Come on, Charles.

Rogers, I don't think I will postpone doing something about you until I'm elected.  To start with, I'll break your neck.

Charlie, he said, unless you withdrew your name -

Hmm!

You're getting farther away all the time.  It's a duck.

But you like me, don't you?  Even though you don't know who I am?

And I know too many people.  Obviously, we're both lonely.  Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes?

Oh, no!  Nothing like that.  Mother always thought - she used to talk about Grand Opera for me.  Imagine! An American girl, for one thing - and then my voice isn't really that kind anyway, it's just that Mother - you know what mothers are like.

As a matter of fact, I do sing a little.

Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.

You always said you wanted to live in a palace.

You're my wife, Susan, and -

Susan, I really think -

Susan, I want you to stop this. And right now!

Love!  You don't love anybody!  Me or anybody else!  You want to be loved - that's all you want!  I'm Charles Foster Kane.  Whatever you want - just name it and it's yours! Only love me!  Don't expect me to love you -

In case you don't know, Emily, this - this gentleman -  is -

Thanks.

I'm much obliged, Mr. President, for your concern about me.  However, I happen to be concerned at this moment with the matter of extensive oil lands belonging to the people of the United States, and I say that if this lease goes through, the property of the people of the United States goes into the hands of -

Your job isn't to give Mrs. Kane your opinion of her talents. You're supposed to train her voice. Nothing more.

All right.

Yes, sir -

Can't say, sir.

He was dead...  That's a poem.  Do you know what it means?

Look out that window.

What lesson?  Not to expose fraud when I see it?  Not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property?  Run it the way I said, Reilly - "This afternoon a great man was assassinated -"

What's wrong, Brad?

No, that won't help.  Besides, you never get drunk.  I wanted to talk about you and Emily.

Do you think the "Enquirer" shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases?

I couldn't possibly live on as little as that, Charlie.  We'll let the salary stay where it is.

You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago.

Never mind -  Bernstein told you about the first days at the office, didn't he?  Well, Charlie was a bad newspaper man even then.  He entertained his readers, but he never told them the truth.

He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially -  That's the answer we got.

Sure, Mr. Leland.  I'll be glad to.

We will assume full management of the Colorado Lode - of which you, Mrs. Kane, are the sole owner.

Oh, I don't know.  They'll clear all right.

I'd rather you just talked.  Anything that comes into your mind - about yourself and Mr. Kane.

What did you get?

What about that apartment?

Rosebud?

Am I sure?

Am I sure about what?

It's a trach ring. It's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box. This one came out of a sixty-year-old man.

It's cheaper than cigarettes. And it certainly beats this.

You've made a wise choice. Keep up the good work.

Okay. I'm sorry about that.

Now he's going to launch into his rap about how he's just doing his job; following orders.  Friends, let me tell you about another bunch of hate mongers that were just following orders: they were called Nazis, and they practically wiped a nation of people from the Earth... just like cigarettes are doing now! Cigarette smoking is the new Holocaust, and those that partake in the practice of smoking or sell the wares that promote it are the Nazis of the nineties! He doesn't care how many people die from it! He smiles as you pay for your cancer sticks and says, "Have a nice day."

Children's programming. What did your mom say when you told her you weren't engaged anymore?

Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?

Can I join in?

Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around?

Nobody can figure it out. And the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store.

No, don't!

You could've broke it to me gently, you know; at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend. I told you I have a girlfriend.

Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is?

No, you're not really getting married?

Thanks for the vote of confidence.

Yeah, but not seriously. Christ, you're ready to walk down the aisle- I'd say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody.

Sang? His name is a past tense?

There's more, isn't there?

I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed.

So who's asking? I don't want to marry you.

Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market...

Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.

Sang.

He's your fiancé.

I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.

I'm not fooling around!  Who went back there?

Everything happened at once. I guess I forgot he was back there.

Give me a stick, pretty boy! I'll knock your fucking teeth out and pass all over your ass.

Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean it! He was trying to get me.

Lenin's Tomb.

Are you open?

So I'm no more responsible for my own decisions while I'm here at work than, say, the Death Squad soldiers in Bosnia?

Yeah.

Shit, if I'd known you were working, I would've come even later.

Go open the sore.

I'm going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been with Veronica for how long now?

Oh, my God.

In light of this lurid tale, I don't see how you could even romanticize your relationship with Caitlin-she broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles.

There was something else going on in Jedi. I never noticed it until today.

Hence, the Empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution.

The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief.

Wait.

I told him that and he yelled at me.

He said it was important to have standards. He said nobody has pride anymore.

I'll give him five more minutes then I'm calling the cops. I don't need this, man. I'm not even supposed to be here today.

What kind of show?

Who cares? That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.

You gotta loosen up, my friend. You'd feel a hell of a lot better if you'd rip into the occasional customer.

Jesus, you got a one-track mind. It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin...

Sorry.

You've got a customer.

Yeah, right.

Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning.

One night only. She's buried in the morning.

True, but do you know how many people are going to be there? All of our old classmates, to say the least.

Twenty-two; same as us.

Bible truth.

Yeah, but at what a price.

What, your dick?

So the casket fell over! Big deal!

If you must.

What'd you rent?  Best of Both Worlds?

Little girl. Maybe five years old?

Watch the store while I go home and change.

In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns.

Fuck you.

What time did we go to the funeral?

What responsibility?

Leave me alone.

Point is-I'm not the kind of person that disrupts things in order to shit comfortably.

You wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night... after I get out of here?

Yes.

I'm her sister.

What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body.

Yeah?

Hey man, that was a long time ago. Don't let it get to you.

Done poisoning the youth for the day?

One seventy-nine.

I can't believe you just rolled a joint in here.

He died in the bathroom.

Lasagne.

Actually, that's his night job.

So I'm told.

Well, that depends. Do you have a bathroom?

Thanks son, you're a lifesaver.

Including you?

You're a pig.

Three including you.

John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.

After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. It's called snowballing.

I'm serious...

Yeah. How do you think I know he liked...

That's because I never had sex with him!

We went out a few times. We didn't have sex, but we fooled around.

Dante...

...And one of those guys was you! The last one, I might add, which-if you're too stupid to comprehend- means that I've been faithful to you since we met! All the other guys I went with before I met you, so, if you want to have a complex about it, go ahead!  But don't look at me like I'm the town whore, because you were plenty busy yourself, before you met me!

...it isn't there. Yes.

What time do you get finished?

I'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex, sneaking around behind your back! And if you think that thirty-seven dicks are a lot, then just wait, mister: I'm going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys I go down on now!

I've been here since six o'clock this morning. Why?

Can I have your name please?

WHAT?

An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours.  It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child.

No way.

Wait, there's more.  Olaf: sing... 

Because he's out of shape.

Oh yeah. You were the built older guy with the black Trans and the big...

I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.

I hope it feels good.

I hope it feels so good to be right. There is nothing more exhilarating than pointing out the shortcomings of others, is there?

Yo, I don't have that kind of cash.

You're gonna be at John K's party?

Don't hold it against him. He just never got Caitlin out of his system. It's not your fault. It's Dante.  I don't know thing one about chicks. Do you want to cry or something? I can leave.

He didn't ask me to...

Says who?

How yo doin', Gabe!

Fuck you.

I copy.

What usually eats a banana?

So...what are you, blind, son? This is a banana eating a monkey, nature in reverse.

It can't fly in this weather.

I need my bolt gun and an ice axe.

Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.

Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare <u>idiot line</u> for transport, over.

I did what I thought was right.

Would you?

Okay--I don't know about this.

One...

The ledge, I know it well, or should I say <u>we</u> know it well.

Yeah, we were caught in a storm. I went up there an innocent climber...

When you call me Gabriel, I know I've got trouble.

You couldn't.

Why are you yelling?

Why are you yelling?

I can't.  Not here.  If you want, I'd like you to come with me...somewhere else.

It doesn't matter, anywhere but here.

Hal knows what he's doing.

He can handle it.

You got to go back now!

Call me sentimental.

Only kidding...<u>actually</u> I attacked you.

Yeah?

Up ahead.

For the record, whenever you hear me sliding out of control, I'm never alright.  When I secure the line, come on up.

We were going together before I ever let go of you.

Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.

Are you crazy?  Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe?

I won't do it.  No way.

I'm going to wrap it around your throat!

Don't lay any guilt on me. Suicide's a personal thing, best done alone.

There's a lot more where that came from.  You're not leaving again?

I burned it.

What the hell's going on?

We're not animals, but don't force us to be.  Walk over.

Kill a few people, they call you a murderer.  When you kill millions, you're called a conqueror.  Go figure.  Move on Tucker, time is short.

Hold on, baby, he'll get you.

What the hell are you waiting for, goddammit!  Don't you see what he's doing!  He's hijacking the shipment!

Let's move your ass in there!!

The monitor! I never ask twice.

Then go fetch.

Insurance against him finding that last case ahead of us.

No, that son-of-a-bitch Walker is alive.

Watch that... Do watch that, O Dim, if to continue to be on live thou dost wish.

Welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, well. To what do I owe the extreme pleasure of this surprising visit? Georgie rises.

The police... The horrible ghastly Police. They beat me up, sir. The Police beat me up, sir. Mr. Alexander stares at him. It becomes apparent he is insane.

Yes, sir, that's exactly who I am, sir... and what I am... a victim, sir. Mr. Alexander becomes frenzied as the speech progresses.

No. She's dead!

Hahaha, and how are you feeling now?

Well, as I've said, we've heard about you. We are interested in your case. We want to help you.

But first we'd like to find out a few things about you.

Well, shall we get down to it?

Alex.

Just a manner of speech, sir.

Because next time it's going to be the barry place and all my work ruined. If you've no respect for your horrible self, you at least might have some for me who'se sweated over you. He slaps Alex on the knee.

What gets into you all? We study the problem. We've been studying it for damn well near a century, yes, but we get no further with our studies. You've got a good home here, good loving parents, you've got not too bad of a brain. Is it some devil that crawls inside of you?

Not true, sir. It was only a slight tolchock. She was breathing, I swear it.

You try to frighten me, sir, admit so, sir. This is some new form of torture. Say it, brother, sir.

Oh well, it's... it's not all music you see, Missus. It's just the 9th.

Let's hope you make the most of it, my boy.

Hi, hi, hi there, my little droogies.

Yes... well good to see you on the mend. I've kept in constant touch with the hospital, of course, and now I've come to see you personally to see how you're getting along.

We put him away where he can do you no harm. You see we are looking after your interests. We are interested in you, and when you leave here you will have no further worries. We shall see to everything... a good job on a good salary.

Good... good boy. Oh yes, I understand you're fond of music. I have arranged a little surprise for you.

One I think you will like... as a, how shall I put it, as a symbol of our new understanding. An understanding between two friends.

Keeping fit then?

Well, how are you then?

Well - I'm back.

Well. That was all took away, son, by the Police. New regulation about compensation for the victim.

Oh well, he met with like an accident. He passed away. Alex becomes a bit weepy.

You wanna be sick?

And, O my brothers, would you believe your faithful friend and long suffering narrator pushed out his red yahzik a mile and a half to lick the grahzny, vonny boots. The horrible killing sickness had wooshed up and turned the like joy of battle into a feeling I was going to snuff it. Minister rises.

Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.

No, sir.

No, sir.

Right. The mothballs, Mister.

Crabs?

Lice?

What exactly is the treatment here going to be then?

You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one day?

I just don't understand about feeling sick the way I did. I never used to feel sick before. I used to feel like the very opposite. I mean, doing it or watching it, I used to feel real horrorshow. I just don't understand why, how what.

Yes!!!

What are we going to do? Talk about me sex life?

Right... Knickers... Cabbages... It doesn't have a beak. Alex laughs. Slide of woman speaking to boy.

That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop.

Fine. Well, that's all there is to it. Are you alright?

I'm sure it won't be long now.

Certainly, my son, certainly. Is there something troubling you, my son? Don't be shy to speak up. Remember, I know all the urges that can trouble young men deprived of the society of women.

It has not been used yet in this prison. The Governor has grave doubts about it and I have heard that there are very serious dangers involved.

Amen. They cross themselves.

Have you ever had any attacks of fainting or dizziness?

Are you now, or ever have been, a homosexual?

Now then. Face the wall. Bend over and touch your toes. Chief Guard inspects Alex's anus with a penlight.

The shiny stuff. The Ice. The big, big, big money is available's what Will the English says.

We've only just read about it in the morning papers.

Dad... It's the treatment. More retching.

No, no, no. That's enough. He's perfect. I want his records sent to me. This vicious young hoodlum will be transformed out of all recognition.

Travel...and things.

Yes, you could.  I think you need it more than I do.  It'll help.  I promise.

Max...

No, no, <u>wait</u>...

In my office?

Seventh, files section.  What should I do?

Yes.

Comin' over Coldwater.  Goddamn deer jumps out in front of me.  You believe that?

I'm...fine.  Fine.

Fella owned this place back then, Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played.  So Pops, he just waves me right up.  My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes.

I think...  ...I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.

Federal?

Tell me.  Has Black Peter already crossed off a few bad children?

Months now.  He's been feeding me information on Dmitri.

What thing?

Oh, right.  The guy flipped out or something?  Killed some people, then put a gun to his own head?

Oh?

And you came all the way down here to see me?

Of course I'm proud.  You know he started with nothing?  Look at him today.  Playing concerts.

By worrying about you spending money on foolish things?  So I can watch them wilt?

What's he sayin'?

What happens if you don't?

Let's not get excited, sir.

What are you guys, taking an all-night tour?

<u>So?</u> Aside from I hate talking to cops, they tell me you crashed the shit out of it.

Oh.  Sorry.

Yeah, yeah, sorry...

Third, but I still can't tell uptown from downtown.  Tell the truth, whenever I'm here, I can't wait to leave.  Place gets to me.  Too loud, too fast...too much.  You like it here?

You always stutter?

...and you promise you'll never tell anybody about this, right?  Get in the fucking car.

I'm trying...

What?

I think so.

It's a mess.

I told you we had other stops to make tonight.

Play music.

I'll deal with it.  I will, I will...

Lenny, my dispatcher.

Yeah.

I'm...what?  Sorry?

I never learned jazz.

No.

Tell her I can't see her tonight, okay?

Oh, I'm captivated.

You'd do her a favor.

Yeah?  What happened?

Doesn't cover everything.

Makes two of us.

I only owe you a ride, Vincent.

You had to kill Heller?!

One more.

That's the reason?

What are you gonna do, pull the trigger?  Kill us?  Go ahead, man! <u>Shoot</u>...my ass.

Who?

Geronimo?

The guy came right at us!

Drop me off here!

Mississippi?

You know, Flip, Vietnam War was fought because of a bet Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onasis.

Shut the hell up.

Come on!  Six major earthquakes in the last three years?  The space shuttle in orbit for every one of them?

I can't promise you anything.

Switch the charts.

<u>Heart attacks happen</u>.

That's how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out.  A lot of people are after you, Jerry.

As opposed to?

That's how a man would do it.  I'm not a man.

Oh, well, maybe to the untrained eye.  Hmm... Ahh...  Ooooo...

What is it with you and the space program?

Do they have a secret handshake?

'The Space Shuttle's Seismic Secret'.  'The Oliver Stone-George Bush Connection'.  Oliver Stone?

Fuck you.  I know you're crazy, but fuck you.

What van?

Realized what?

Right here in Manhattan.

Jerry, I --

Now's not really the time to get into this --

I thought you -- Why -- Love ruins everything, doesn't it?

Thanks.

Where are we going, Jerry?

How come serial killers have two names, but lone gunman assassins have three.  John <u>Wilkes</u> Booth. Mark <u>David</u> Chapman.  Lee <u>Harvey</u> Oswald.

To Jonas.  I didn't know that at the time.  Didn't know who he was.  But I knew inside, whoever he was, he'd send someone else.  So I started watching your father.  I wanted to keep him safe.

They'll trace it.

Jerry...?  <u>Jerry</u>.

Where are you?

You think it's a conspiracy?

That's great.  Good for you.

You've never seen her run.

You're welcome.  Where's my partner?

That's ironic.  Because we're here to protect her from you.

The truth shall make you free.

Only on the football field.

We're very specialized.

Re-educating trained killers in the ways of polite society. Making sure the men who've gone over the edge won't hurt anyone. That sort of thing.

Ask what you can do for your country.  That kind of thing.

If I had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, I'd arrest you right here.

And what did I say?

<u>My dog</u>.  One I intend to put to sleep.  Extrapolate from there.

You do recognize it then?

I don't understand.

Then this is a goddamn emergency.

Agent Lowry?

This doesn't make sense.

I don't like it.  Something's wrong.

I was just thinking that.

Wasn't my idea.

What do you suggest?

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

I don't know.  Ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.

Really?  Congratulations, by the way.

Did I tell you we've expanded the search spectrum?  We're including several other possible magic frequencies -- not just the hydrogen line anymore.  I was trying to get inside their heads, y'know?  And I started thinking, what other constants are there in the Universe besides hydrogen, and then suddenly it was so obvious -- transcendantals, right?  So we've been trying variations of pi...

David --

As of three o'clock this afternoon. I submitted my resignation.

Excuse me, I'm late for a meeting.

It could be anything.  The first volume of some Encyclopedia Galactica...

A transport.  So are they coming or are we going?

Analyzing signal polarization shifts.

In ancient times when parchment was in short supply people would write over old writing... it was called a palimpsest.

Maybe it'll be at the end of the data when the message recycles.

No primer.

This is how you see the sky?

But what do I say?

I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.

But -- other people from our planet should see what I've seen -- they should witness this for themselves.

Please -- if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have -- it could make the difference --

Oh, maybe not out -- but definitely looking for you coat.  I understand you've had some difficulty locating the -- what are you calling it?  The 'primer' that will make decryption possible...  I've found it.

You're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --

That would seem to be the question of the hour.  I want to build it, Doctor.  Of course I'm already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption -- but as I said, my colorful past has made many of those channels... difficult to navigate. I need someone on the inside.

Japanese squid fleet.  They use lights to attract them to the surface... then turn them into sushi.

Yes.  A shame.  Still... it'd be worse if they died for nothing.

Perhaps.  But on the off-chance that it is a 'doomsday device' of some kind, I plan to be very far away from your lovely Texas when it is activated.

Peter Valerian.

Yavol.

Thirty-one linked dishes.  You could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here.

I'm going on staff at the N.S.F.  To work for Drumlin.

Ellie --

Ellie -- I'm getting married.  Her name's Laura.  She came up to Owens Valley to do her post-doc about six months after you left.

Wait -- hold on a minute --

And where exactly does that put your position...?

What about you?  Doesn't all of this shake your faith at all?

Very smooth.  It's Palmer, right? Where I came from a palmer was a person who cheated at cards.  Really though... the Bible describes a God who watches over one tiny world a few thousand years old.  I look out there and see a universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars... I mean burn me for a heretic, but your God seems awfully small.

Only a tiny bit.  Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt.

And there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?

You may not believe this... but there's a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your God.  To believe that we're all here for a purpose, that all this... means something.  But it's because that part of me wants it so badly that I'm so stubborn about making sure it isn't just self-delusion. Of course I want to know God if there is one... but it has to be real.  Unless I have proof how can I be sure?

Yes.  Very much.

Something like that.

An excellent question, Doctor.  But what if we don't like the answer?

The final countdown.

Thank you.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry -- I can't --

I can't hear this now --

It also makes God enormous.  I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away.  As it will everyone else's.

Ellie, the only one holding you to that standard is you!  The people want to hear your story, they need to hear it!

Have you seen what's happening out there?  The terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie.  People need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them!

In other words.

I question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile.

Nobody is proposing we censor the truth here, Doctor.  We're simply talking about putting a mechanism in place --

But --

Have your department make a full report.

Git your shovel and git to work.

I've got this weak heart. Too much drinking, I guess. As soon as they find out about it, they'll probably send me someplace else.

What are you doin' here?

Yeah.

Ram it in and break it off!

Git to work!

Yes, Boss. I got it right.

Blue'll git him, Boss. We'll git that bastid, Cool Hand Luke.

Hey, Tattoo!

Ah believe I smell me a blonde-haired lady.

Wouldn't surprise me none.  Wicker Man says you got a hundred- twenny and some change in the Captain's safe and you got your five dollars pocket money... That'll buy you a whole fistfull of cards. You in or out?

I got eyes, don't I? How my not gonna see something like that?

Get away!

The man wants speed, let's give it to him. Ram it in and break it off. Go hard. Shag it.

You ol' sack of guts. I had a belly like yours, we wouldn't have nothin' to worry about.

Take it easy, Drag.

On my own.

Luke, are you alright?... They got us, boy. They're out there thicker'n flies. Bosses and dogs and sheriffs and more guns than I ever seen in my life. We don't have a chance, Luke... They caught up with me right after we split up and they was aimin' to kill you, Luke. But I got 'em to promise if you give up peaceful, they wouldn't even whip you this time.

Luke, you got to listen to me. All you got to do is just give up nice and quiet, just play it cool.

Cuter.

Ace calls. Here we go.  King-five gets a tray for no help.  Paira ninas gets a Jack.  Ana man with the ace gets... slop in the face... Ninas up.

Cuter.

Kick a buck.

A phoney? Whatta you mean, a phoney?

Give in? That's our Luke out there.

None of your fucking business.

What did I do?

Stop acting like a silly little fag!

Without question?  He only scored 40 percent, four out of ten criteria?  Couldn't another expert say he <u>flunked</u> the sexual sadist test?  What curve are you marking on, Doctor?

Only part.  What else?  What did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because Joan of Arc told him to do it.

What Friday?

The door was open, swear to God, I'm just looking for her when you come charging up the stairs...

He told you she was loaded, any- thing you could steal you could keep, Conrad?  You bought yourself a return ticket to Quentin, breaking and entering.

She don't want it.

You know I can't do that.

I need her; she's a cop.  I have to kill a cop, and then...

I don't care -- she's a cop.  That's the important thing.  Cop-ness, not sex-ness.  It won't be perfect, but it'll be good.

I have no life anymore.  I ruined your life, make me pay for it.

I think this is number three...

What calls?  I haven't made any calls.

How do you know that?

Look at the bottom of the screen. You see the icon with the arrow pointing left?  Click on that... twice.

It's too big a file to copy to a disk.

I don't look at pictures.  I look at the <u>real thing</u>.  I don't feel infected.

Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in <u>your</u> computer?

That's no surprise.

I turned it off.  It's like an open window he can climb right in...

Have you got a warrant?  Get the hell out o here!  This is the <u>only space I have left in the</u> <u>world</u>!  Why can't you leave me out of it?

Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half way to nailing him.  Serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive.  This guy has a plan all thought out, flexible and complex.  He's playing a game with us.  Who will he imitate next? Maybe he's doing all the serial killers in history, the great innovators, the murderers' hall of fame.  Just to prove he's better than all of them.  They got caught; he didn't.

What's that music.  It's Abba.  I can hear it.  It's Abba.

They get fan letters...

Ruben's dead.   So stupid, a cop thing, a crazy kid and a buncha dumb mistakes... I'm sorry... because you and he...

You're exhausted.  Let me get you a brandy.

I've got to go.  I've <u>got</u> to go.

He hasn't done Bundy.  He's done every one of the others, hasn't he? If there are three dead Chi Omega college girls tomorrow, how will you feel?  Go there.  See if there could be any way for him to escape.

Let me get a little action started here.

I'll get a locksmith.

What else?

He's got Sergeant Halloran in there.  He'll kill her the minute he sees or hears your people...

Someone broke into her place last night.  It wasn't connected to our case, but it shook her up pretty bad so I haven't...

Lieutenant  Quinn.

Classy madonna.

He's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine.  We heard from Doctor Hudson?

My promise.

Right.

What?  I talk like a cop, this is the way I talk.  I can't believe this guy.  Saks.  He's a Deputy Assistant Director of the F.B.I. "Let me help you!"

Helen Hudson...

You got a suspect...

Give me Ruben back...

Why don't we save it for later? It's almost time for Letterman.

In the private aircraft hangar. Anybody could have walked in.

My car, not yours. Yours is a complete wreck. The police dragged it to the pound behind the station.

It is?

You're not envious?

It does.

I think it's badly scarred too. From a motorcycle accident.

It's not here. Maybe the police are still holding it. Their forensic people...

Were you badly hurt? I think we saw each other at the hospital.  I don't want the car. In fact, I was appalled to find that I have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped.

That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.

I don't know. You can never be sure with Vaughan. This is his show.

I saw the blood. It looks like motor oil.

A complimentary ticket for a special stunt-driving exhibition. Definitely not part of the big auto show. There's a map in the packet and a note requesting you be discrete about the location.

Serious. But you'll have to take your new friend, the female crash-test dummy. She dropped it off for you.

Hard to say.

No, thanks. I'll go with Vaughan.

It's not the police. It's the Department of Transport. Internal politics. It's a joke. They have no idea who we really are

You could get your wish at any moment.

Psychologist, therapist, whatever.

What?

All I want you to do is think about what's best for you. Really think about it.

I think it's about that time, Letty. The charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well.

Look, Mom, I think I've found the dress.

Do you think I should?

Loaned you. And it's only 'til you get out of here.

I ruined your wedding night.

You've only known Jake a few months.

Can I get you a glass of champagne?

I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so... They didn't have the olives, and I, I got so upset. I don't know how it happened.

But what about Beast?   Who'll...?

And my class. It'll be hard to find a good substitute. And what about my math program?

We haven't. I wanted to talk that over with you, too.

I will, Dear. I promise.  Why McDonald's?

Don't be fresh.

There's a spider in my room.

Green spot.

It's OK.   It's good to let it out.

I'm glad.

It's OK. It's not a pass-fail kind of thing.

No.

Is this really important? Because I don't think it's a problem.

You have no right, no right to take the worst thing that's ever happened to me and make it into some kind of game.

I wasn't hungry.

The left one.

OK, OK, I'll give it back.

And I'm not covering for you when you sneak out to call Dominos.

No rounds for another three hours.

Back-to-back sessions with the shrink.

Break up?    They wish.

I just want to see Beast.  Where would you go?

But I do.     I love you, too.

Oh, right.     I'm ready.   How do I look?

I was brilliant, or at least boringly sane.

No, I need some serious household advice.

Aren't you ever quiet?

Open up.    I want to see.

You like it?

Really?

It's sex time.

Yeah?

You go ahead and relax. I'll cook.

Are you OK?

Coming.

You don't have to know all this by Saturday. It took me years.

Letty, please.

Someone has to take care of you right now, Michael. You tore up the apartment. You stopped taking your medications.

It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?

In there's better.  It's kind of romantic, don't you think?

Huntley told me today that if I come through on the Benton deposition, they may consider me for senior associate.

I'm calling in sick.

I don't feel like going to work today.

Yes.

I'm going to the store.

I know. We can't just keep going through the motions.

You don't have to say anything else. I've known for a while that this was coming.

So, what do you say, Let?

I've met someone else.

I'm glad you're doing well.

Shhh. They're coming to the cubic zirconium.

Do you know who this is?

If you ever want to get those tapes, meet me in one hour at Grant Park near the statue.

Hey, you're not exactly the most trustworthy guy in the world. I took a shot. It didn't work. Did you bring the tapes?

I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare. Now, if you don't want me to keep on hurting you, it's important that I believe you and right now I don't. So tell me, where did they go?

It's me...

You're calling me on your cell phone, right?

You don't trust me?

It's Daniel.

Well, you better get the money somehow. Six o'clock and come alone. If you don't we'll destroy the tapes.

No thank you.

I'm taking a vocabulary course to enhance my communication skills.

Supernumerary. It means better than expected.

You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me.

Yes.

Not such a good friend.   May I reach in my pocket?

Thank you.

We can't.

Why do I have to pick up the tapes.

No one? Then why is Zero here?

I'm trying.    It doesn't work.

What for?

We'll think of something.

Mr. Bastaldi isn't asking you if you want to go. He's telling you you're going! And if he's telling you you're going to be going then you are going to go!

You know, if you could get your nose out of Bastaldi's ass for two seconds you might see what's going on around you.

I think if he told me he was going to steal Van Gogh's "Sunflowers in a vase" I would remember it.

What is that a threat? Are you fuckin' threatening me, Marcel?

Good. Zero and Julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. The rest of us will come in through the front door.

Good idea.

Has to be.

No?

Even if we get out of town and go to another airport I'm sure the FBI and Chicago P.D. has alerted customs.

He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it.

Can I trust you, Sami?

You haven't answered my question.

I can see that. The man's car you stole. Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy motherfucker. And Frankie Zammito's got the word out he's looking for some French dudes. You're French ain't ya?

Fine.     Ten o'clock.

Hector, don't interrupt me.

I don't give a shit about your cousin's car. We're here about my car. So, shut your mouth! You think you can do that? You think you can keep your big mouth shut?

You said don't do it, boss.

What'd they take?

A Wallet.    A hotel room card.    Some cash.

Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.

I can handle the exterior alarm, but the one in the bedroom is a problem.

And he gave it to us.    145 Ridgeway Road.

Hey, it's not your picture on the TV, it's mine. So, try to be cool.

We've got to get out of here.

She took everything!    Didn't even leave us cab fare.

This is the only American car you've ever driven.

What the hell is he talking about?

How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?

I don't know.     It's gotta be millions.

Oh, Marcel! I thought you were somebody else. If I knew it was you I would have never run.

I've still got a few legal problems back in the States.

Mr. Taylor?

God, I want to go home.

The baseball is mine.

No.

Uh huh.

The papers for the car will arrive tomorrow.

Cool.

Oh, you think?

What?

Where is it, Sophie?

And you don't speak French?

Zero did not put it in his bag.    He put it in yours.

How are we supposed to sleep with this noise?

So you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed?

Something like that.

No. I got it in prison. I went in for three years. When I came out she was married to my best friend. Happy?

It's okay.   It was a long time ago.

It's not your fault.

After last night I could say the same for you.

Yeah. I'm going home today.    What do you want, Frankie?

I don't know. Sell it. It's gotta be worth something. Someone gave it to me. C'mon Frankie, I'm trying to make good here.

Why were you spying on the Yus?

Real sharpness comes without effort.

I owe you nothing.

He is my defeated foe!

She's one of those.  Your mother would not want you consorting with her kind.

Don't invite danger into your father's house.

Beautiful but dangerous.  Once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire.  It's 400 years old.

Maybe it is.  I wouldn't know.

Thank you for seeing me.  I hear your wedding day is near.  You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.

I was just passing by and wondered how you were.

Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.

It has.  How's business?

During my meditation training... I came to a place of deep silence... I was surrounded by light... Time and space disappeared.  I had come to a place my master had never told me about.

Perhaps.

But something is going on at the Yu household.

You always suspected she'd fled to the West.

Be careful.  Sir Te requires discretion.  Official business is difficult enough.  Don't let personal feelings make it worse. And I don't know... even this poster... could be some sort of trap.

Have you questioned him yet?

To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger.

Not a bad idea.  Tonight we'll get a good night's sleep at headquarters.

I doubt it.  This thief... it very unusual...

We must avenge mother!

Sir Te!  It has brought him as much trouble as glory.  Help him to leave these troubles behind. Otherwise, he'll never be able to start anew.

Please do not be such a stranger. You'll stay the night as my guest. Now, Shu Lien... tell me something. And forgive me for prying.  Your father was a great friend to me, and I think of you as my own daughter.

Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.

Annie, I need a file.

This is special, darlin'.  Please?

You must listen carefully:  the Fire Department will be here soon. There is an injured man in the alley who needs assistance.  As Shelly Webster once needed your assistance, and as you are shortly going to need my assistance.

You don't say.

I'm sorry as hell, man.

My pleasure. ERIC Don't smoke these.

Funboy had to leave this mortal coil.

Out.  Now.  I gotta work.

Fun -- look at that guy...

Fun, he's not going away; he's scaring the piss outta me!

I think he's yours, now.

I went to see a friend of mine.

She's still dead.

Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...  Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her too, I think.

Hey, I got my rocks off, so fuck you in the ass, man.

You don't even remember...

Another jolly nickname?

I can see her.

Fine with me.

Very well, it's your ass.

Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake,

Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.

I don't think so.

You might say that.

Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I...  turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but -

Excuse me?

Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect.

You didn't show it to anybody?

I was just being honest. You happen to have a nice ass. Sorry.

Take yourself. You've slept with several women. Are you happier because of it?

It's not really important.

Why are you being so dramatic?

Give me the fucking letter.

About what you said today in the stable. I'm not a happy person.

I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.

How about tonight?

Without question.

Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing.

I will.

You? Volunteer? I don't think so.

Okay.

I can't win with you.

I am lighten. Can we drop this?

Where are you going?

Oh please Annette. You spend all your time preaching about waiting for love. Well here it is. Right in front of you, but you're going to turn your back on it. I'm sorry that we're not at the age where we can get married. If we were, I'd propose, but that's not going to happen. So I guess we're just fucked. I'll move on, but you... you're going to have to live with yourself knowing you've turned your back on love. And that makes you a hypocrite.

Get off me.

Yeah, me neither.

I love you.

Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been with my family for over sixty years. Does your family do much riding?

I'm familiar with a lot of breeders in the mid-west. What's his name?

- none taken -

Greg McConnell.

Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing Spartacus on television tonight.

Alright, I believe you. Stop crying. Your secret's safe with me.

Margarita found them while cleaning your room.

Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs. Rosemond's before lunch.

Thanks.  Nice meeting you.

Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you.

It's Kathryn.

I don't know.

I am?

I don't love him. I love Ronald.

Mmmm, you're right. Those clothes don't do you justice. Why don't you take them off.

You promised to let me kiss you.

I don't want to kiss you here. I want to kiss you there.

No.

Really? Care to make a wager on that?

Get out of here.

I told you to lock the door.

I'll be in touch.

Who is this?

Ronald?

No.

He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in.

Don't worry about it. I'll stay.

Why go through Cecile? Why not just attack Court?

Could you be more desperate to read it?

What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car.

I'm working on it.

I now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag. Any luck corrupting her daughter?

Call Cecile up and get her to come over. I'll bust that cherry in a heartbeat.

What's your plan of attack?

Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.

Yeah.

What's your problem?

She's really getting to you, isn't she?

She shot you down.

You're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. God are you a chump.

Mock, mock, mock.

And that's why you're leaving?

Thank you. Now, where were we?

And if I don't?

How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. Where do you get your strength?

Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...

Oh please. I can't have you do that.

You must be Sebastian. I've heard such nice things about you.

Oh... no thank you...

Nope.

You're a lucky guy.

What are you talking about?

Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about.

It's one of the clearest memories I have. Twelfth night...burning pine... and mummers' plays.

Oh, lots of times.

I had my breakfast while you were still asleep.

It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?

What's her name?

All right, mommy.

I wonder if you don't resent that in her?

She's not Irena's child -- there's nothing of Irena in her. She's my child.

I'm not a jealous woman, Oliver.

It's early yet.

Yes, darling,

No kids yet.  Something's gone wrong. Maybe I ought to call somebody.

I think I should.  3000W?

I live right here.

I wanted to talk to you,  I wanted to tell you about the other children.

It was on account of the birthday party.

It's true.

It was just a voice.

Daddy, it's true.

In the garden? Would she be there now?

I can not tell you.

No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.

The numbers simply don't mean anything

It reminded me of you, so I bought it. It cost me more than all the others.

Because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind.

I wouldn't be surprised if it were a true wishing ring.

I'm trying to.

Will you come soon?

But Mrs. Farren just started to tell me a story. Please.

But she's such a nice lady.

It's a hard winter. All the animals are bold as brass, coming down into the streets for food. You'll see a lot of deer this winter.

But I saw what it was. It's the little deer.

Why is it just lying there? Why doesn't it get up?

No, thank you.

Then I'll tell you a story  a lovely story. Do you know the story of Rapunzel?

No, not people -- just deer and game, but the people he catches can never be free again. They too must kill and kill, covering themselves with blood.

Yes, yes -

My daughter died long ago.

Anybody could know that song.

Yes. Yes, Barbara, I shan't forget.

Good night...Barbara...

Little miss, you can't stay here. You've got to come with me.

That's from her -- that woman.

Yes, everything's all right, Edward.

I imagine a child would have to commit murder or rob the Seventh National Bank of Tarrytown to be deprived of a birthday party.

Well, that seems a harmless fancy --

We'll see that she gets there in good time

Jennifer gave her a make-over.

Maybe that bartender made it up. I mean I think coyotes are rather beautiful. Maybe "coyote ugly" is really a compliment. Like someone who's conventionally "ugly" but is really beautiful.

Yeah but they looked cool...

Nearly four.

No it's mom.

Anything's better than Mark.

Frida, I don't mean this as a criticism, but you might not want to talk about PMS around men.

I get a little bloated sometimes.

Or if your boyfriend's an asshole.

I don't know.

Holy shit, I'm a freak.

To sound like big macho cops. He was probably just found with a knife in his back.

He was trying to get into my apartment and... I know this sounds gross but I was so turned on. I grabbed him and kissed him!

My vision got worse again.

Rule one: always wear make-up.

Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.

Give him the tampon test.

No they're not.

I put it down the garbage disposal.

Because of PMS, I get hairy, my nails turn into claws, I eat raw meat, I roam the city hunting for flesh. I've become a werewolf!

I haven't gotten it yet.

Did you get rid of Mark?

I should call the police. Oh no Peter. Peter is the police!

That's a terrible thing to say. Frida goes back to scrubbing the floor.

Check out what I found.

I think I already have.

You scared the shit out of me. I thought you were killing yourself.

About Mark? Carlton?

Did I kill a guy named Benito?

Oh, a D-Girl. You know... I have a really great idea for a screenplay.

Come on, didn't all that steak make you thirsty?

Oh my god, I'm sorry!

I'm kinda borrowing it. Who's this, Mr. Date-Guy?

Take your shower.

Did you change your hair?

Yes, that's what we're looking for.

I'll make a note of that. Put the coverage on my desk.

Uh... yes. Not for us. No woman in jeopardy. Find me Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman. Find me a true story about a crazed killer stalking beautiful women.

No?

Okay, if you think of anything else, please give us a call.

That's my ex. He's an asshole. In case you couldn't tell. I think he's been following me.

I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.

So what book did you buy?

A man killed in Central Park.

Still haven't figured out how he or anyone else pulled that off. Never seen anything like it.

No, I got it. It's okay.

I love you too.

No. But I don't mind hairy. Are you okay?

You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?

Maybe we should have children. I don't think I'd kill the father of my child.

We didn't have sex.

Oh my god, what happened?

Take some allergy medicine.

Man, you're livin' dangerously. Let me ask you somethin', you always have to get women drunk before they'll sleep with you?

You're some catch Lloyd.

Torn apart. Limb from limb. A bloody gruesome mess.

Oh, so you decide to be a cop? Seriously? You don't have sex with a woman cause she's on the rag?

Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.

You take the cake Lloyd. Come on, she's not here. Let's check out her psycho ex.

Can't figure out the species. Similar to a wolf. They're jokin' at the lab that a werewolf probably killed him. Ain't that the stupidest thing you ever heard?

What of?

Nope.  No maps.  Ocean, huh?  On vacation?

Not really...

I don't know what you're talking about.

You are mistaken.

How could you have been so stupid?

I didnít requisition a secretary.

Good.

Won't say.  Says he must talk to you.

Yes, sir.  <u>Everything</u>?

Why are they after you?

What?

Well.  The only thing I've been certain of, all this time, is that I need to get to the ocean.  The point is no one seems to know how to get there.

A few days...  a few weeks  -  dunno, I can't remember.  Worse thing is, I never know if it will change back again...  Now, please leave me alone.

What is that door?

No.  Have a look.

Everyone has a job  -  a function.  Each one teaches you more about your invention.  I'm what is called a <u>murderer</u>.

Then we must call the police.

Shut up!

You think I haven't been trying!  It's like there was never anything there.  Just water.

Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just like a broken record.  Only thing is, I can't answer.  I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.

That's what people keep telling me.

Not that again...

No it isn't.  <u>You</u> are doing it!  Now raise it over the glass and...

I'm...  being...  punished.

It's the truth...  I need you.  I know you're innocent.

Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?

We'll be back for you first thing tomorrow and if you need me for anything, Duane will be right outside the door.

Oh, sure.  Remember the convention speech?

Well it's a last minute change.

Great.

I'm the President and as they say 'The buck stops here.'  So I take full responsibility for every one of my illegal acts.

She's a little hysterical right now. We've got her upstairs in a laundry room.

Bob...

Mild stroke?

And...

Fine.

I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!

Hundredth cabinet meeting.  I thought it was a nice touch.

I'm going to kill him.

Bob...

Sort of... Yeah.

Dave -- I'm working.

I'm not surprised.  Can we save anywhere?

Choices?

... Somewhere there is a distant light, guiding us through this rocky shoal...'

'America isn't in what we say here tonight -- it's in the faces and the smiles of a Sunday afternoon...'  Hand on the heart...

It's just five minutes.  She comes in. You wave to the press. She leaves.

She hardly ever sees him and it'll be so fast, she won't have a chance to tell.

We vetoed that?

She knows.

Why?

Well I'm sure that's really important, but I don't want to tell some eight- year-old kid he has to sleep in the street because we want people to feel better about their cars.  Do you want to tell him that?

Oh... Thanks.

Certainly.

Really?

We'd like to hire you.

I can't say.

What about it?

`Bleed for your king.'

Yeah.  I'm sure it's keeping you up nights.

I saw the light.  I thought maybe you were up.

Anybody would have done it.

Oh yeah?  Me, too.

I'm not the First Lady, anymore.  I shouldn't be here.

Truman used it all the time.

I don't mind.

I run a temp agency.

It was inspirational.

Yeah... Bedtime.

I can't.

Looks like we're not going to get a chance to get much done.

I know.

Father Mclntire.   He blessed you at the inauguration.

All set.

And if I don't? If I don't you'll come back after your death. You'll come back and find yourself hanging there...wanting to eat...needing to eat human flesh. You hate that thought, don't you? That's the ultimate sin for most of you fools, isn't it?

The mainland...is dead...a dead place...nobody there...

Look.

Let's just....wait a minute. Get a better look.

Quiet!

...Captain Rhodes is trying to...

SHUT UP, MISS HENRIED! I TOL' YA B'FORE!

What is it if it ain't a curse?

Datura.

It's...he was...one who came to the island with me.

The hospital? 

He's my contact for Chrissake! There's two crates. Can you get me into the hospital?

Come on. Let's go.

What you wanna do?

They are brutes without feeling. Though I admit that I've requested cremation for myself. Burial is an archaic tradition, even more ridiculous now than it ever was. To say nothing of the...spacing problem...on a small island like this.

PULL IN! GET THE OTHERS.

Leave me alone, you...COCKSUCKER!!!

My..."detail", sir. We're going to bury the heads.

In the battle, sir.

So don't goddam come!  Please.

Knox?

Cameron, what is the matter with you. You act like they're your mother or something.  You afraid of them?

Come on.  It'll help you get Chris.

What is the point?

How about a trig study group?  Right after dinner.

Except sex.

So much the better.

I don't know what misguided impulse caused you to pull that ridiculous stunt, Mr. Dalton, but, whatever it was, I hope you've learned your lesson.

Miss it?  It drives us crazy.  That's part of what this club is about.  In fact, I'd like to announce that I've published an article in the school paper, in the name of the Dead Poets society, demanding girls be admitted to Welton, so we can all stop beating off.

I'm not?

Doing fine, sir.

Good.  We're very excited about him.  He was a Rhodes Scholar, you know.

Sure, but Cameron asked me too.  Anybody mind including him?

That's not my fault.

All right.  I'll second that.

Nothing, unless you object to having girls here.

They were walking along the fence past the soccer field.  Said they were curious about the school so I invited them to the meeting.

What good will that do?

Sort of.

Chet's parents don't know about it, so please keep it quiet.  But you can bring someone if you like.

No.

I don't care.  I love you, Chris.  You deserve better than Chet and I'm it. Please accept these.

You say that over and over but you don't even know me!

And if it so happens that you're wrong? If it just so happens that I could care less About you?

Are you going with Chet?

Just give me one chance.  If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever.

Rahesh Non never existed, Mr. Meeks. You make him or someone like him up.  No self important college professor such as this one would dare admit ignorance of such an obviously important figure and you will probably receive a comment similar to the one I received:

I didn't know you taught.

Oh that. That was an exercise to prove a point.  About the evils of conformity.

A barbaric yawp.

Ah, so you boy's have been snooping.

All poetry was acceptable.  The name simply referred to the fact, that to join the organization, you had to be dead.

Okay.

Maybe they don't want worldly things distracting me from my teaching.

Ah, but I am seeing the world, Neil. The new world.  Seeing a student like you take root and bloom.  It's worth everything.  That's why I came back here. A place like this needs at least one teacher like me.  Did you come here to talk about my teaching?

Isn't there an easier way?

Why don't you read it to her? It worked for Nuwanda.

Listen, anything's, better than mystery meat.

But she's in love with: the moron son of my father's best friend.  What would the dead poets say about that?

I'm sorry, Neil.

Father, I wasn't disputing you.

Yes sir.  I'm sorry.

Nobody-  I thought I'd surprise you. I've got all As and-

I... I just don't want to come.

That's a laugh.  If I don't ask, at least I won't be disobeying him.

From my father and Nolan.

They gave me the exact same thing as last year!

Maybe they don't think at all unless it's about my brother!  His birthday's always a big to-do.  The stupid thing is, I didn't even like the first one.

I'll come to the performance.

Yes.

Boat or no boat...I'm going...

That's where my boat's moored.

Just trying to get to my boat...

You hear that?

...there's got to be a way to access out back there...

Nothing...you want to come, come... you don't...

Look lady, I know you people are used to getting your way...

That's what I do.

Quite a few.

Oh yeah? What kind is that?

A meat locker.

Yeah...

Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.

He's not coming...

...we gotta get outta here -- NOW.

I saw these guy perform...at Altmont ...you know that? They opened for the Stones...

That's it? That's all you give a shit about?

Good! So maybe he also know where the hell am I going to get the parts I need...

Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?

Squid...squid like...squid type... it's got tentacles, a feed sac... probably one central nervous processor somewhere...what the hell do I know is going on deep down in the ocean...there's all sorts of shit we've never seen...eighty foot clams...60 foot sharks...I'm just guessing...can you get me more juice out of Hercules...fast?

Seafood salad.  You ever operate a jet ski?

Line it up now, nice and easy...

How does an island sound to you?

You want some too?

Nothing.

Hey! Come out here!

Hey! You hear me? Come out!

Shut up!

She fucked me.

Those are mine!

Damn right!

What?

Hey! Fuckin' A!

You're full of shit!

I know, but...

Well... you remember Cynthia?

Vince thinks... you know...

Who? Who is?

Couple of weeks... Listen --

Jesus!

Hey, Nick! God damn!... What've you been doin', I mean...

You mean...?

Worse since she talked to who?

Well, where the hell is he!!! I mean what are we all sitting here for!!!  WHAT THE HELL IS THIS???

Where? Where is he?

Unfortunately I must now go in, but I leave you my card. Naturellement I pay my players cash American. Just so you know.

Linda, yeah.

Yeah?

Nick, she won't say why.

Here.

Listen, Biederman, I'm going to club you into the floor unless you tell me what the fuck is so important.

Biederman!

I don't know.

No.

I'll kill 'em. Anybody bothers you, I'll kill 'em!

I... No. You do this for money?

Up north.

Nick.

I want to go home, Merle.

The shot?

I don't think about the shot that much.

I don't know... I guess I think about the deer... Being out, maybe. I don't know. I think about it all. Hell, I like the trees, you know? I like the ways the trees are, all the different ways the trees are too.

You got it.

Huh?

What are you, God?

We what?

With more bullets?... Against each other?... Are you crazy!!! Are you fucking nuts!!!

I'll pick the moment, Nick. The game goes on until I move. When I start shooting, go for the nearest guard and get his gun.

Sit down.

Merle... Hey, Merle, listen...  Why?

Watch it, shithead!

Then lemme have 'em.

No!!!?

Right.

Place is great. Really. One great place... Basketball, bowling. You name it. Canasta. Hearts. Lots of guys are making salad bowls. What I'll do is make a salad bowl for you, unless you'd rather have a pencil holder. The pencil holder's neat, I mean --

Nick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin' scared to go home.

It's not socks, Sal.

Phantom Mary?

Yeah!

They have these little sticks, Vince. They call them "chomp chomps", and when you get these girls going, you have to stick 'em in their mouths.

What'cha got, Bennett?

Technothugs?

Wade did a little reminiscing.

What did you say?

I remember what he looks like.  I can't forget.

You stole the heroin out of the evidence room and planted it on me.  I was iced.  What better way to keep me from talking.  Stop me if I'm wrong.

We seem to've come across a 211, sir.

But sir, Sergeant Wade saved the hostages.

NPA syndrome will hit 'im fast.  Have your men gear up the Edicon system at a twenty-year ratio in fractions of fives.  Saying a prayer won't be bad either.

Kill me if you want.  Hard line me with that 'I ain't got nothing to lose' bullshit.  But you've got plenty to lose 'partner'.  You've got a family.  I'm giving you a chance to see them.  I kept in touch.  She never married. All these years.  Maybe she loves you.  I wouldn't know why.

Keep 'em busy.

Not the 'T' word.

Doucet killed my partner.

There's no time.  There are civilians in there.  It's about to go down.

Yes.

Bacon cheeseburgers.

Trust me.  You don't want to know.

You don't follow the bodies, and you don't follow procedure.  You do it by instinct.  Think like him.  Do what has to be dane.

No thank you, sir.  Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.

<u>Comwatch Dispatch System</u>.  Can't assimilate voice stress.  Code priority only.

We're partners, aren't we?

Aaah... Mother of Jesus.

If you were set up, I want to find out who did it.

My mom says I'm gonna grow.

My granddad was a policeman.

Remember, get the seat fixed.

We will --

No, thank you -- what's your name?

That's my problem, Belle.

Young man -- you got me there.

Maybe you can, sometime, Daniel. I'm a farmer, you know, and like to show my farm -- but the thing I'd like to show you most, you'll have to see for yourself.

No, siree, it didn't. And it won't -- no matter what happens -- just as long as the folks at the fair believe in freedom and Union. So --  Giddyap, Constitution -- and let's keep going, Mr. Stone.

It's mine, Ma! Pa made it for me -- and I'm not going to give it to anyone!

That's just too bad --

I don't know -- don't seem much of an idea to me.

Well, Stone -- have you got the money?

No, Stone!

I'd like to know where you'd get it....

I dunno -- I can't figure it out. I've invited them all. Why don't they come?

-- of what happens after we die!

You can't say that to me! I'm New Hampshire. If I say I called you, I did.  I guess I did.

Yes, of course, people forgot -- or the men who knew about it died, you know how these things happen.

Well, why should that worry you. A soul -- a soul is nothing. Can you see it, smell it, touch it? -- No! -- Think of it -- this soul -- your soul -- a nothing, against seven whole years of good luck! You will have money and all that money can buy. Upon my word, Neighbor Stone, if it weren't for my firm's reputation for generous dealing--

Well, I'll be -- 

The seventh day of April --

I don't care.

Leave your tongue off of that!

You promised me prosperity, happiness, love, money, friendship --

Small? Oh, I see what you mean. Why, they vary.  Now a man like Daniel Webster, if I ever get hold of him, I'd have to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing.  In your case --

I'm through with you.

I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything.

Seems like it's my fault, Mr. Webster.

Thanks, Mr. Webster!  To the champion of the whole United States -- Dan'l Webster!

There's no joy in it for me.

Well, I --

Breakfast ... Ah! ... Come along friends, Ma Stone's a cook this side of heaven.

Oh yes -- yes. Won't take a minute. Can you keep a secret?

Yes -- and that's the reason I wanted to talk with you. You got my invitation?

You think that's a joke? I had him on there too, but I was afraid Dan'l Webster might feel insulted.

You mean that's all you had me come out here for?

You are not so sure that he'll come.

Oh, Jabez.

That's wonderful language. It would move a stone.

It's all right, Jabez. We'll find something to pay Stevens.

Jabez -- you ought to talk to Tom about joining the Grange.

No, Jabez -- all I need is some rest -- You go and pay our debt. Everything'll be all right then ... everything.

Jabez!

Yes -- you are right, Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --

Jabez --

Yes, Mr. Selectman!

Mary -- but look -- it didn't touch an ear of my corn -- we'll have a rich harvest.

Hello, Jabez --  Here's your son.

What in sugar hill's the matter with him?

I am going to lock him up.

Isn't that your own fault?

Oh, Jabez! ...  Did you hear, Mr. Webster? --  Now you'll help him, won't you?

All right, Jabez ...

Yes -- I was getting the seed -- I stumbled -- I saw one of the boards warped up a bit -- and -- there it was.

Ma -- and yet, a man could change that, couldn't he?

Make out? We'll do better than that!  I never thought I'd be glad for bad luck, but I am. I never thought I'd be glad of a hail storm at harvest time, but I am! Oh, bless ye the works of the Lord in the hail and the storm and the rain!

Fiddlesticks! She don't hear it. Got better music to listen to than that.  There -- that's what I mean.

Let him try it.

I won't forget.

No, really, thank you. -- Is Mrs. Webster coming back soon?

Oh, could you, Mr. Webster ?

Mary -- what love and trust could do for your husband, you've done. And frankly, in a very few moments, this is going to be no place for a lady.

I'll drink to that, Mr. Scratch!

You can talk to me ...

It's corny, but I could live with it.

Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge here.

No, sir.

He was my only brother...my only family!  I want blood for my blood.  We search...now.

This is what this is about?  Out building project in Indonesia? Contrary to what you people think, we're going to develop that region... not 'exploit' it.

Okay.

Who are you, then?

Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt you.  Who are you?  What are you looking for?

One weekend I went to a combat ranch...  You know, that game with the, the guns that shoot red paint?  Must sound pretty silly to you...

Put it down now.

That was Gary Cooper, shithead...

We may have some problems.  How is your schedule?

Good enough.  And unless you like is messy, you'd better start taking us in groups to the bathroom.

I'm an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane. And now that I'm moving up to kidnapping, you should be more polite.

It's a long story.  You know, I think that Ellis has his eye on you.

No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?

Holly Gennero?

I've spent half my life on airplanes,			* I can recognize someone who just got off one.  I'm Joe Takagi, Mr. McClane.  I have ...something to do with this company.

I'm ahead of you...partner.

Al, what's wrong?  Did something --  -- Oh, God.  You're coming in!  That's it, isn't it?  Christ, Powell, I told you what you're dealing with here --

The plastique I found.  Is the building on fire?

You don't want to know.

I still feel like shit.

I got it.  But you can tell her yourself.  Just watch your ass and you'll make it.

Dwayne Robinson.  Well, what have you learned?  What do they want?

How do you know?

Yeah.

Come on, what's under this?

You men shoot, aim for the white meat!

They're not after you, they're after me.

Yeah, well I don't blame him.

Hello, Sonny.

You're crazy.

Sal?  Yeah... Sal is with me.

He ain't going out.  And if I go out he's just gonna kill the people. There's a lot of lives that I'm responsible for... that's all.  So, I can't do anything.  I got myself into this mess and I'll get myself out of it... the best way I know how!  One of the ways is not giving up.  I'm telling ya!

All right, enough!  Who the fuck is on the phone... anyway?  Is that you Moretti?  You on the phone?  Will somebody talk to me?

Well, then...

Yeah... I'll write a song.  Ha, ha. I don't know.  Life is funny!

What are you doin' in there?

I'm not alone.

What do you want to know that for?

Call me Sonny-boy.

One word.  You won't find it in the phone book.

... armed robbery ...

I don't know, Sonny.  I don't know if the helicopters can land in here. I'll have to check it out.  I got superiors, unnerstan?  They don't always see eye to eye with me. I'll do what I can.

I want to see my wife.  I want you to bring her down here.

Is on its way ... The helicopter can't land but we got a bus ... the jet's on its way to Kennedy ... we got a bus coming here ...

Can't land ... you'd kill people ...

What else?

Aspirins ... okay you got it.  Charlie!  Six pizzas!

I can take care of that.

Well, you get your mind right.  I'm a Catholic and I don't wanna hurt nobody, but goddamn it, don't you play no games with me.  Unnastand?!?

Give me the keys...

Sal, get 'em in the vault.

I took too long.

It's locked on the inside.  It's through that passageway and to the right.

Well, they go to guard school.

I don't care who you are ...  I just want to get you outta here, safe, right?

Would I hire you?

Why not?

Girls, I wanta apologize.  For my language back there.

You don't want cancer?  You're about to get your head blown off, you're worried about cancer.  Gimme the cigarette.

For God's sake!  As soon as I'm outta this bank robbery, I'm gonna stop ... okay?

You know, you remind me of my 19- year-old brother - only he's got his hair down to his knees - he looks like something that eats berries and roots out of the ground. God forbid I should say something to him like, 'Listen, if you ever smoke marijuana, just remember that it's illegal' and he storms outta the house.  You rob a bank, but you keep your body pure, is that it?

All right ... send them the guard.

... because if you're talking about coppin' a plea, I'm tellin' you right now, there's no deal ... I'm never going back to prison ... We got our own deal already ... Do you remember the pact we made?  You and me and Jackie - that night in the bar ... we were talkin' about if we get trapped in the bank, what are you gonna do ... Right?  What did we say?  What did we say!

Yeah ...

They gotta stop sayin' that.

Okay, Sonny.

Let's move it, goddamn it.

I've got a jet.  I'll have airport limousine here in a half hour.  I want the hostages.

I'd like to work with you on this, not against you.

You got guts.  You think if Sal and me have cut their throats we're gonna let you out?

I wouldn't like to, but I will, if I have to.

I just want to see all you young ladies are all all right in here.

The manager, he's diabetic, he's lookin' bad.

Okay.  Which one goes?

I am.

Who the hell is that?  God damn it! What the...

He was very understanding - you ought to talk to him ... Algeria?

Did I say a thing against her?  God forbid I should say anything against that fat cunt.

Maybe...

No.  This really pissed him off, Sonny.  He says you're dead.  He says he doesn't have a son.

Okay, newsman.  How much you make a week?  You're not talkin'.  You payin' me? What have you got for me?  We're givin' you entertainment ... what are you givin' us?

Then talk about somethin' you fuckin' know about ...

<i>Mr. Bishop... this is Claremont Williams. I own the Williams Brothers armored car service.</i>

Yesterday I received an e-mail from a source. In this e-mail were four social security numbers linked to the gentlemen who presented counterfeit California driver's licenses to my company late last night.

How much?

I've been training since I was twelve. Knives. Guns. Throwing stars. You name it... I can fight with it. I'm a hard worker and a fast learner.  Nothing scares me. I'm not afraid to die.

<i>Choco grew up on the streets of El Salvador. When he was four years old... he stabbed another kid in the eye-ball with a pencil.</i>  <i>There were wires crossed somewhere in his soul.</i>

<i>Are you all right?</i>

<i>Chinga te y tu mama tambien.</i>

Maybe you should fuck her mom then.

Did it hurt?

<i>I'm calling from the Kappa Epsilon Gamma house at California University.</i>

My Frances? Frances and Charles have been kidnapped? <b> EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- NEXT </b>

There's always a loophole with you, Claremont. Your black ass is one big loophole. <b> INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- [FLASH FORWARD] NIGHT

You white folks don't understand the natural beauty of a woman's figure. Those are birthing hips. More cushion for the pushin'.

Mr. Weiss was very generous in turning over some video tapes to the FBI. There's lots of footage of you. We know everything.  If you don't come clean... the information on these tapes could send you to prison for a very long time.

Take us to Vegas.

Yeah. <b> INT. FENDER HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER </b>

Stop it.

<i>It was the beginning of the end.</i>

Wow. Laurence Harvey. He knew Frank Sinatra?  I knew Frank.

I was a musician.

Yeah?! Well... I loved her too.

<i>Mum was terrified for me. She didn't approve of my lifestyle one bit.</i>

YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

No. What's the big deal?

Then so be it. If you believe what that Indian said we were fucked either way.

SPEAK ENGLISH! JESUS CHRIST WE'RE ON TELEVISION HERE!

Do you know where Danang is?

Fucking Map Quest. <i>Never again.</i> <b> EXT. DOWNTOWN GARAGE ROOFTOP -- NEXT </b> Ziering and Green approach a LARGE TENT. The WINNEBAGO is parked off to the side. Alf is inside... doing something with a WELDER on the front of the RV.

And he used to fuck a Playboy centerfold every night.

Just shut up and do what they say. They're gonna kill us if we don't, Ian.

Your theory is valid... <i>in theory.</i>

Check this out.  Y'know Sal's.

And?

Did you ask Sal?

Two dollars!  Forget it!

No, are you?  We want some Black people up on the Wall of Fame.

What?

I'm cool.  I'm cool.

You the man.

Don't worry about it.  But when it happens and I'm in my boat and ya black ass is drowning, don't ask me to throw you a lifesaver either.

Too long!  Too long.  Now for the life of me, I haven't been able to figger this out.  Either dem Koreans are geniuses or we Blacks are dumb.

No!

How old are you?

Wake up!

I'm in here.

I just come home to take a quick shower.

Don't worry 'bout me.  I always get paid.

I'm coming.

Yo, I'm gone.

What are you so worked up about?

I'm getting paid...

Pretty soon I'll be making a move.

I know, Mother Sister, but I'm here now.  Where's the stuff?

Twenty "C" Duracells.

Fuck!  My money!

It's a motherfucking shame.

Nobody talkin' 'bout ya moms.

You know you don't get paid till we close tonight.  We're still open.

Tonight, when we close.

I didn't say nuthin'.  You must have a guilty conscience.  What are you guilty of?

Where we goin'?

I wants my money.  I wants to get paid.

That's it?

Bring some ice cream, I'm burning up.  Do you love me?

I can run out and get it.

I'm sorry, but no rawness is jumping off tonight.

Tina, it's not like that.

Later.

Who don't work?  Let's see you carry six large pies up six flights of stairs.  No elevator either and shit.

Y'know, I've been listening and reading 'bout Farrakhan, ya didn't know that, did you?

Ya like him, huh?

That's what I think.

He's right.

On the rebound.

I just copped them.  Let me tell you the story of Right-Hand--Left- Hand--the tale of Good and Evil.

I love you, Black.

Forget it, Mookie.

I didn't want to come to work anyway.  I hate this freakin' place.

Yeah, no more ninety-minute deliveries around the corner.

Too many pizzerias already there.

Pop, what else can I say?  I don't wanna be here, they don't want us here.  We should stay in our own neighborhood, stay in Bensonhurst.

Be right there, Pop.  Listen to what I said.

Four colors? Neato!

HARRY Dunne.

Oh, you want to talk about your delicates?

Are you kidding? I couldn't be more okay.

Coming.

No, I'm fine thanks.

Yes, Harry. I can't home school you anymore. So maybe it's time to make some new friends, some friends your own age...

It could be anything. You're going to discover a whole new world when you get to school.

Probably because we've never met.

You're it.

HARRY, what are you doing? She's a foreign exchange student. She doesn't speak the English.  CHING CHONG ching chingy chingy chong chong.

JESSICA? Please hold for my reaction.

Yeah, he's a pirate.

LLOYD, she's my mom.

Oh, no. You're not gettin' me again.

Oh! Ho! Okay. You wanna go?

That's why you have to drink it fast, trust me.

Maybe I should go home and grade papers. Owwww.

HARRY, I said don't 'dress like a Queen'!

You can't marry my mom.

Just wanted to see how your doing.

Yes.

So, have you given him "some" yet? 

HARRY, this is my fantasy! I suggest you leave - before I imagine something horrible.

A blimp.

Who?

What do you mean? We can't go in there or we'll be "it".

Yeah, that's why I asked.

D2.

Three words. I did. But you were all mad at me and wouldn't listen.

I don't know who we are anymore.

Maybe the pirate who buried this treasure chest made it. Put it on.

And with that complete loser

Right.

I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.

Oh, you're good.

Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.

That's not your tape.

You're just jealous.

This school's never had one before. I'd like to talk to you and all your special friends.

Don't answer me. Say what I say.

Do you want me to pet your head?

I know, you want go for a ride.

LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?

You were born free and free you should remain.

Can you believe it?

Go in there and get us two slushees.

He passed away three years ago.

We're not crazy. We're "special". PRINCIPAL COLLINS wants us to have our own classroom!

So miss snoopy reporter girl, it appears that you've snooped yourself into a corner and snoopcuffed yourself to a desk. Whose wearing the Coconut bra now?

Yeah, I get it. Don't worry I studied acting at the police academy just let me do the talking and you'll be fine.

How baby-cakes? You've done it all.

I think you'll make a good teacher.

Yes. So as soon as Zimmer shows up, we'll get our check and blow this pop stand before anyone finds out anything.

Love it!

What does Leto say, Piter?

With your permission...

The carryall will come and lift off the spice harvester. Try and get in close over the harvester... you'll find this interesting Sire. -- The Duke accelerates the ornithopter in the direction of the harvester. Paul can SEE...

Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....

It's a high-efficiency filter and heat exchange system. Perspiration passes through the first layer and is gathered in the second. The salt is separated. Breathing and walking provide the pumping action. The reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you can drink through this tube at your neck. Urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads. Should you be in the open desert, remember to breathe in through your mouth, out through the nose tubes.

Would you really have drawn my blood?

Your Reverence.

No.

What do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?

Greater than treasure, Usul.  We have thousands of such caches.  Only a few of us know them all.  When we have enough... we shall change the face of Arrakis. Listen!...

Long live the fighters!

Pain.

You feel the flesh crisping?

Where?

It's a pleasure...

No.  I never drink -- wine.

Yes.  There is nothing more comfortable.

I told you, I don't want any of your goddamn coffins.

Huh?

Because I'm planning on dying soon.

Thank you.

I have no next picture.

Well... I guess I should go.  Perhaps we could get together again?

Don't worry.  I do it every Halloween.

Well, It's about how people have two personalities.  The side they show to the world, and then the secret person they hide inside.

Ah, so I pull the strings!

I am always on time.

Uh, Eddie, do you have my money?

Well... can't I play the romantic part?  I'm tired of always being the bad guy.  You know, back in Hungary, I played Romeo!  I would like to be the lover again -- me, in a boat, with the girl...

That's good.  I could use the money.

"Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure." Audience laughs.  Applause.  "Say, that's a funny place to sleep."

I never said I could ad-lib...

Bad decisions are easy to live with. Forget.  Just keep looking forward.

Nonsense!  You look great --  Look, uh, why don't you lie down and take a little nap?  We'll film around you for a while.

You'll be fighting with the octopus.

Bela, somebody misplaced the motor. So when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you.

I'm sorry, Eddie.  I'm so sorry.

That's great.  Let's do a take.

Eddie, how was I?

Has anyone ever been to Downey?

And once I'm a woman, Jean-Claude and I are getting married --

Rolling.

This is kind of a stream--

I'm Criswell.  I know all.

I guessed.

Cris, you made it.  Thanks a lot.

Yeah.  It seems a little crazy, but sometimes <u>you just know</u>.  She's perfect for me.

Look, he doesn't have any money... but I'll give you everything I've got.  I have a few hundred dollars.

What?

Who?  Robert Taylor?!

Boris Karloff!?

Boy, I can't even remember the last time he was in a picture.

Since I was a kid.  My mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing.  It just kinda became a habit.

<u>That's not the issue</u>!!  Ugh!  How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?!

Say it a little louder.  I don't think Bela heard you in his trailer.

Ed, it's just one man's opinion!

That's the problem!  <u>Nobody</u> cares about my movie!  I'm tryin' so hard, I don't know what else to do!

Perhaps a small amount of money.  How much do one of your motion pictures cost?

That's all??  That seems very reasonable for an entire picture.

Oh my, this is very interesting.  Say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts?

That's not true --

Nobody in town has seen it, so I'm givin' you first crack at my talents.

Hruphh...?

Da pleasure be mine.

But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent.

Nonsense!  You must try our hot glug.

It's the damn money men.  You never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods.  And then they all think <u>they're</u> a director...

Ugh, I hate when that happens.

Tell me about it.  I'm supposed to do a thriller at Universal, and they want Charlton Heston to play a <u>Mexican</u>!

It is when it works.  You know the one film of mine I can stand to watch?  "Kane."  The studio hated it... but they didn't get to touch a frame.  Ed, visions are worth fighting for. Why spend your life making someone else's dreams?

Well, Mr. Weiss, I'm your guy.  I work fast, and I'm a deal: I write AND direct.  And I'm good.  I just did a play in Hollywood, and Victor Crowley praised its realism.

Tits.

I don't think he's a schmuck.

So change the poster.  Trust me, you'll be better off.  This is a story that's gonna <u>grab</u> people.  It's about this guy.  He's crazy about this girl but he likes to wear dresses.  Should he tell her? Should he not tell her?  He's torn. George, this is DRAMA.

Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.

Yeah??  Well Orson Welles didn't wear angora sweaters, did he??!

Oh.  My condolences.

Oh, hi.

Not good...

Yeah!  Don't forget "Mercury Theatre"... And then every Saturday, I'd go to the little movie theater down the street.  I even started ushering there.

No! I love sex with girls.

Okay?

Bela died.

Who's Dr. Tom?

Let's get married.

Didn't you just make one called "Bride Of The Atom"?

You don't wanna be noticed?

I don't know.

Here's to Ed.  For making us into something.

And you're gonna make a bundle.  This movie's gonna be famous!  But only if you SHUT UP, and let me do it my way!

Don't worry, I'll teach you.

You mean like a date?  I thought you were a fag.

I'm moving out.

What?

Cool.

Um, yeah -- thanks.

I feel like when I was a kid and my mother sent me to school in orange corduroy pants.

Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari?

We're going to get you a bodyguard, don't worry. Ed, I have some news for you. We're picking up Ed TV for another month!

You asked me if I had a dream. I said "Sure, I have a dream. I just don't know what it is yet."

No. You screwed up my life just so you could get higher ratings. You never gave a shit about me.

I'm not sure about the entire concept.

What are you talking about? He's fine. He's out of the hospital already. The ratings are higher than ever.

Yes?

What about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick? I'd hate to think he...

Hotel? What were they doing in a hotel?

No.  The deceased is ... Henry Pekurny.

Look at this -- people are getting married, they're getting married...

We're falling behind.

Tell me.

I'm gonna stick this right in your eye.

Oh.

He made a mistake.

Mm.

I'm not! I'm just trying to get some facts.

He had a woman in my own bed! And how dare you call him "Dad" in front of Al.  This is your father. This is who was there for you when you needed someone.

Hank! He said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged -- he cried. So I went to this horrible hotel he was staying in... I felt so sorry for him --

And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home.

She left.

I'm sorry. Where'd they send her?

They're gonna mock our foibles.

Our foibles, our foibles!

Ed, he needs a break. You don't know what kind of bad luck he's had --

No, I mean...

It means they hate his freaking guts. It means if he were on fire they wouldn't put him out.

Well, then I'm quitting.

Who's in it?

Welcome to work, Ed.

Hey, believe me -1 know I've got a great chance of making a fool of myself, here.

I'm not. I'm not. I'm just Look -- you know, in a way, it's good. He got this out of his system now and he knows it's not worth it and, you know, someday if you guys got married or something --

That's lucky.

I know, I ...

... yeah, then, but...

Who cares? I don't ca -- No. I do care.  Shame on everybody. Shame on you! Well, just the seventy-one percent. The other... 

Yeah... I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show.

...yeah?

No. It's your fault.

No... Could you?

Everybody's someone.

Come on.

It's what I do. I yell "Geronimo" and jump out of a relationship.

What are you drunk?

What is?!

That's like... those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they're in the NBA.

We're excited.

Hi, Shari.  Let's go in the stockroom.

What?

Hey. Check this out.  Look at this.

Ray --

What's the dif --

She didn't know he was a criminal. They had a relationship. They --

It's the receptionist at one of the places I service video equipment -- she's very pretty and, you know, she never even talks to me and then today I come in and she's all "I saw you on TV the other night... You were so great ... " Next thing I know we're ...

Save it.

I put his -- who --  Look, Marsh, he's not that good a singer, he'll be back.

Let's remember how I got into this. "Please, Eddie, do this for me. I can't get a break." 

Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?

A hundred per cent cotton. Okay, here we go, Andy.

Who's Shari?

Hi.

It's Ed.

Hi.

We have to stop meeting like this.

Sure.

Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude.

He ended up moving back to Milwaukee to live with his parents. I haven't heard from him in a long time. Poor guy. I warned him.

What kind of person?

Here, get down.

Jim, don't.  You're scaring him.

Dick... Dick,..

Tammy,  now we've come to a decision. He just think it would be best --

So nice

Well, I thought that... well, the way it always works is that SGA president does a count, then the SGA advisor, you know, for the two independent counts.

You have the key, Mr. McAllister.

Huh.  Okay.  Well, I guess I'd better do my count.

I didn't make a mistake. Every vote was there when you sac down

Yes, I do.

Ethics are...

...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...

I thought you were supposed to keep them.

Good luck, Tracy.

If it's about the posters, I think it's so awful. It's a travesty.

Wait - are you accusing me? You're not serious.  I can't... Mr. McAllister, we have worked together on SGA for three solid years and... I mean, I can't believe it. I'm... I'm shocked!

Looks like today's your lucky day

Yeah.

Yes?

My house.

Take as much room as you want

Walt, we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech.  That's not what student government's about.

Possibly.  Please just wait outside.

I'm the one.  I did it.  I tore down Paul's posters.

I did it.

I don't know. All I know is I did it I

Still clear?

We'll let it run awhile

I also like bananas.

And 290 "disregards," right?

Sure, Tracy.

Don't you fucking knock?

Okay.  Great.  I feel good.

What's it to you?

Till 19-fucking-70.

It's not what you think.

Yeah, plain scotch.

I don't know.  I never heard of the Nite Owl till today.

Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today.

Yeah.  But not for long.

You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?

No.  Now.  You fucked him.

It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him.  Why the loyalty, Wendell?

Your partner's through. Department scapegoat on the Chief's orders.  He's been billed, he'll be indicted and he'll swing.

Wendell, I want you to come to work for me.

Homicide?  A detective?

How'd you get them to retract?

First I want to go on record as saying that my Susie was a virgin when she died.

Look at a picture for me.

Yeah.  A great big one.

Officer White, put down that weapon and --

<u>Stensland and Buzz Meeks</u>.  Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants.  When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus.

The first guys to the car when Jack and I got there were Bruening and Carlisle.

There are no rules!  Why the fuck are you doing this?  The Nite Owl made you.  You want to tear all that down.

He had help getting up there.  Two of his fingers are broken.

<u>Lynn</u>.

We should check the records, and, we should talk to Lynn.

I spent years trying not to live down to mine. 

I was here, hosting a party.  Who was killed and why do you think I can help?

I don't know him.  Mr...

You know I do or you wouldn't be here.  How did you find me?

He no longer works for me.  Find Susan's killer, Mr. White. I'll give you a handsome reward. <u>Whatever you desire</u>.

Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them?

Deuce Perkins.  Mickey C's narcotics lieutenant.  The night he got clipped, eighteen pounds of Mickey's heroin went missing.

Susan Lefferts.

Dick Stensland.  Had to be dumb panic.  If she knew him she would've been sitting with him... Right?

Until he gunned down six people.

Someone must've pulled the records.

I don't have time.  I have --

Say what and so what.

Dogs got no reason to live.

I don't own no shotguns.

He runs call girls.  Primo tail. Fixed up like movie stars.

Answer yes or no.

It's mine.  I'll make you my second in command.

There always are.  But there are also three men and three guns. Matched forensically.  A few loose ends don't matter.

No.

<u>Throwing me</u>?

You're the payoff expert.  I'm just doing my duty.

You make a mistake?

Rollo's the reason I became a cop. I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it.  It was supposed to be about truth and justice and Rollo.  But somewhere along the way I forgot all that... How about you, Jack? Why'd you become a cop?

I've given up angles for awhile. I just want to solve this thing.

Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White. What the hell's going on?

What?

Of his penis, sir?

Bud White's been here?

Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken.

You're the first person to ever call me tough.

Forget everything else for a second, Lynn.  Is there anything you can give me on Dudley Smith?

None.  Call it a hunch.

Stand there with your camera. I'll stop here so you get Grauman's Chinese in the backgrouns.

Something good?

Sure, he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke.

Sid, cut the crap.  I --

Jesus.  Jack, that's a story. 'Swish Actor Gets The Gay Blade.' Let me get my camera.

A bootleg...

Yeah.

And no one'll know about this?

Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?

Maybe you bumped into someone who took it and you didn't even know.

I don't know what that means.

Listen--

Come straight here. Don't talk to anyone.

Except for the part about my setting up a company in Zurich and knowing anyone named Sam Vollotti and having any relationship whatsoever with the Gambino family.

Rachel Banks?

What do they have to do with this?

Wait.

It means the NSA can read the time off your wristwatch.

If I knew, they'd be after <u>me</u>. Which they probably are right now. 'Bye.

Pal, you're cooked. It's over. What you did, who you were...that's done. I'd find a quiet job somewhere shoveling snow.

They froze your accounts. Get outa my way.

Look, my wife is understandably--

I called my wife!

How do you know so much?

Jesus.

Jesus. Do you have proof?

Why?

What if--

Not particularly, no.

Oh my God.

You're a tough nut to crack, Dylan.

I'm married.

Yes. I have her permission.

Is that good?

Thanks.

Could you give me just a moment to talk to a friend of mine here? Not about this, but...Daniel?

<u>What's</u> your point.

The robbery.

I'm not his attorney.

Than why don't you talk to the bus driver?

Somebody took my blender.

Right.

A guy named Brill. Same guy as always.

No.

I didn't want you to be upset. I shouldn't have lied. Stacy, there's nothing between me and Rachel Banks.

It's not a real picture, Stacy, it's been doctored-up.

Was that doctored-up, too?

This is science-fiction Robert! The manager showed me the transfer notice with your signature on it.

My father's put me in touch with an attorney. He'll be--

That was for Christmas.

Albert's gonna get me my job back.

A friend of mine. I don't know his real name. He's dead now.

It's not?

That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.

You didn't squeeze DePinto?

Yes.

Other than me.

It's not me?

Yeah.

And may I ask what could possibly be more important than Fawell Oil v. U.S. Environmental Agency?

Merry Christmas, son.

This is <u>bullshit</u>. Someone's mixing up a bunch of half-truths to ruin me and to ruin my case.

Mr. Dean--

What are you talking--

Hi, dad.

Are those my Christmas presents?

Can I open 'em up?

Alright!

What about jewelry?

The blender?

They only took electrical appliances.

Into what?

Why would they--

Listen to me.

To the cops?

Yeah?

Go fuck yourself.

Yeah.

I honestly don't know.

Zavitz had digital compression equipment. He could've downloaded into something. A disk, a chip, anything small enough to put in his pocket and run with. Whatever he put it in, he dropped it in that bag.

We're not gonna hand you and your band of lunatics the keys to the kingdom. I'm not gonna sit in Congress and write a law that allows the NSA to point a camera and a microphone at anything they damn well feel like. And the next time you have something to say to me, we do it above-board, in my office, like everyone else. Now get outa my car, I've got a committee meeting on the hill.

We found the originals.

Hiding something?

Destroy his credibility before he goes public. Neutralize him. I don't want anyone listening to a word he has to say. Tell me about Rachel Banks.

We believe?

And if it wasn't?

What's your ETA?

Federal Express for 'Zavitz'.

You have any idea what kind of position this--

No.

Yes sir.

Yes sir.

What kind of fossils?

I don't want to go back.

I don't believe that.  I think you are insulted by me, somehow. You're a foreigner too, aren't you, here, in this market?

I'd like you to have them.

And that would be unconscionable, I suppose, to feel any obligation? Yes.  Of course it would.

In an hour there will be no stars. The air is filling with sand.

Fiction.  We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood. Go on.  More.

Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.

You don't sew at all!

What?  No!

No, no, it's Hungarian.  My daijka sang it to me.

You bastard, I was believing you!

I thought we were against ownership?  I can stay tonight.

No.

I can't move.  I can't get out.

A surprise, he said.

What?

Yes.  Absolutely.

Still a car.

Are you mad?  Katharine loves it here. She told me yesterday.

I haven't, no.  Sorry.

Sorry, what's your point?

Could I trouble you for some water?

I looked at them.  They're shrubs, small trees.  Exquisite.  And fossilized, rock hard. He walks away to the nose of the plane.

No, because you can't see from the air! If you could explore from the air life would be very simple!  Look!  What is that?  Is that a wadi? That whole spur is a real possibility

What's the matter with you?

What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears.  In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa.

Absolutely right, shut up. Lashings of apologies all round.

Yes.  It was.  Thanks for the compass. I'll look after it for you.

Goodbye, my friend. They shake hands.

There is no God.  But I hope someone looks after you.

That's your name innit?  Count Fucking Arsehole Von Bismarck? What's that supposed to be then, Irish?

You're the prettiest girl I ever saw.

Just kiss me.  It would mean such a lot to me.

Thank you.

No.

I keep explaining.  You've got the wrong man.  My name is Bellini - Antonio Bellini.  Bellini, Caravaggio, both painters, I think that is confusing you.

I slept with the girl.  I've got a wife in Tripoli.  A girl comes up and points at you, you only see trouble.

Don't cut me.

Don't cut me.  Come on.

I met your friend Mary.  She said I should stop and see if you were okay. Apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal. Cabot, north of Laurier.  Bonjour.

She can take you as far as Florence.

Finally!  So you're our Canadian pickpocket?

I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts?

Moose.

For?

Me?

I had to get back to the desert. I made a promise.  The rest meant nothing to me.

Aren't you?

Isn't it?  Wedding present from Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.

I was repairing the stairs.  I found a library and the books were very useful.

Thank you.

Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.

He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him?  Do you recognize him?

Really?  That's sudden.

Why?  Is he staying?

We should charge!  Doesn't anyone have a job to do?

Would you like me to?

I'm not sewing anything else.

I love you.

I've done this.  I've had to do this.

Then I'd think there must be a reason.

Is that what you think?  Is that what you think I think?

I'm thinking about your heart, not your skin.  And how to reach it. And that I don't think I can.  A bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb I thought would ruin us.

I'm feeling old.

Don't move!  Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL! Hana stops. 

Not at all.  I was thoroughly enjoying by book.  Please.  Signor D'Agostino, Herr Bermann.

How awful.  What will you do?

Why not?

I don't think so.

Why?  Are you German?

How do you know you're not German if you don't remember anything?

Then you were married?

You got a better idea?

With that computer--nobody better. Out there...it's different. You twisted your ankle stepping over a curb on Madison Avenue.

How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?

This was my first excuse to get away. I can't exactly use my cell phone.

I don't know, but close.

I'm in the middle.

He's on to something bigger.

Too late now.

Uh. I'm showing off.

No you can't.

How about if you try disappearing.

Where did you hear that, one of those American talk shows?  Check, please.

You're joking.  You can't trust anyone these days.

I sincerely hope so.

No. Why would I be?

The most important piece of Chinese art outside of China.

You can't.

Quite a good one. A Monet. Not major, but it is Giverney.

It's simple. You pick up the painting, you pay for it with this debit card.

Give him the card.

Up to you. You could tell him the check is in the mail.

Not bad. I didn't expect you to make it out.

No. Entrapment is what cops do to robbers.

I guess I have a more optimistic view of human nature than you do.

Good morning.

As I recall, you've robbed it before.

They're having a farewell party the last night. Before the Mask goes back to Taiwan.

I drilled the bolts and went in through the window. It was the only way to bypass the smart glass.

We get the Mask I'll tell you.

Let's just see how we do.

We are...for the tools.

Try laps. Say a hundred.

Yes you did.

It's---beautiful.

Terrified. Still am.

I had a lifeline. If I've got a lifeline, I'm okay.

In eye of that painting.

What?

A billion dollars.

Okay, 80-20--

Hold the record. Alone.

Okay, look, I'm delivering this to a man who's going to give us the key to our job. But it's pointless to try to explain it yet. You just have to trust me. I don't have any more secrets.

There's food in the fridge. I won't be long.

Would you quiet down! Just for a minute?

Right. The eight billion.

Then the vault, how to get in the vault, that's stumping me.

That's the beauty of it. There's only one tiny window of time when this will work. At the handover of Hong Kong--from Britain to China. The handover from them to us.

I've covered everything. And you're the best, so--

Surgically attached.

Call it a new tradition.

Have really held you under?

A flaw in your research, my dear. I grew up chewing shoe leather for breakfast.

No way.

No, you can't.

Tomorrow. It has to be tomorrow. Or forget the Mask.

Remind me why.

It's not just art, it's history. Something you Americans don't care about--because you haven't got any.

Faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin. I got to have trust.

You're giving them to me?

Probably not.

What the fuck did you do with my stuff?

What do you think?  What's this?

It's those files you asked for.

Usually, in adults, it's from exposure to bacteria or a virus or ...

You're a lawyer?

Right.

Right, but -- I'm sorry, I don't see why you were corresponding with PG&E about it in the first place.

It's a chemical they used over at that compressor station up the road there.

For what?

You did?  Wow, sorry about that.  Listen, Mario's a little not so bright.  He seems to think that you said --

I was wondering -- could you tell me who I'd talk to about maybe getting an advance on my paycheck?  Just -- for the weekend.

Oh.  Huh.  Well, look, I got this file I need valued. Real estate thing.  A lady has some property next to a PG&E plant that PG&E wants to buy. I need to know what to ask for it.

Yeah.  Isn't that a shame?

And I realized, he's taking a chance too.

-- It's about being realistic.  Something like this, Erin -- it could take forever. They're a huge corporation.  They'd completely bury us in paperwork.  I'm just one guy with a shitty little P.I. firm.

Four more.  Eleven people.  So far.

Well -- I found one document at the water board that had a toxic test well reading from 1967.  A hell of a lot of people have lived on that land since then.

Yeah?  Then gimme another raise.

Well, good, Ed.  I like working with you too.

They're trying to intimidate us.  Tell them to wait in the conference room.

Boy, this job takes me to some of the best damn places, huh?

You might want to think real hard about the amount, too.  My kids are sitting in the God damn parking lot right now, cause I still don't make enough to afford good child care. Makes me think about looking around for a job where I'm appreciated, for shit's sake.

Not in my world.

Okay, look.  It's an important meeting. Kurt thought, if it was just lawyers --

"Fun?"  Jesus, "<u>fun</u>?"  I kill myself for a year and a half, hand you the best case of your life on a God damn silver platter, remind you of why you became a lawyer in the first place, and you think of me as "fun?"

<u>Not personal</u>?  That's my <u>work</u> in there, Ed. My sweat, my labor, my time.  If that's not personal, I don't know what is.

Perks?  Jesus -- <u>perks</u>?

Because Kurt doesn't want to work with you. He thinks you're a loose cannon.

Say you were wrong.

You see your office?

Oh, okay.  Here it comes.

The extortion, the threats ...

Corey.

That's right.

Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl for some water records.

Harmful, like -- how?  What would you get?

Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.

How come you're not eating?

Some kind of half-wit, no-good, big-haired, bimbo, I bet.

I'm a slow reader, on account of the fact that I look at the word "dog" and see "god".

You never fall short for the work people.  I guess maybe you just love them more.

Yeah.  She is.  But you know what?  That's why I'm helping her.  So she can get some medicine to make her feel better.

Everyone's.  This is a lawsuit.  We need to be able to contact the plaintiffs.

You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart.

Annabelle Daniels.  714-454-9346.

I do.

You got a little girl?

You need help with your kids?  I could probably do that.

Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you?

Cause I like kids.  I like hanging out with them.

Yeah, we'll just see about that, won't we?

Fixing a leak under your sink.

I'm just saying --

Thinking.

What's that?

I'm sorry.  I'm just working so hard --

I pretty much knew what your answer was gonna be.

Fine.  I'll drop 'em off tomorrow afternoon.

Nice to see you, Erin.  We've missed you.

What's going on?

Yes.  It's called accountability.

What?

Outside with the sprinkler.  So it's good?

Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries --

Yes?

Is this a joke?  Did Baxter put you up to this?

He did, didn't he?  <u>Baxter</u>!

Right, I guess those are the kids --

You did?

Don't go telling anyone.  It'll ruin my reputation.

Alert all commands.  Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them.  Don't fail me again, Admiral, I've had quite enough!

You won't.

I'm sure I'll see you again, too. Keep well.  You'd better chain him until it's over.

A great warrior?  Not many on those.  Wars don't make one great.

It's the Jedi's time to eat, too.

The son of Skywalker.  You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing.

You are weak!  I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed.

There isn't a hint of life in the area.  But all the perimeter markers are set, so you'll know if anyone comes calling.

Go tell your precious Princess ... Luke is dead unless he shows up soon.

The energy shield is down.  We'll be stuck here forever.

I must admit there are times I don't understand human behavior.

I'm going to see what it is.

Good.  Soon as we're clear, we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive.

Me?  I don't know what you mean.

And you think you're the one to apply some heat?

Wait, don't open it ... that's one of the traps for the ice creatures.

Very funny.  You can let go now .... I'm getting angry.

How do I look?

Well, I hope you don't expect more.

You mean a man you can control.

Try and control this ...

No lightspeed?

Chewie, check the manual release on the landing claws.

The fleet is finally breaking up. I'm hoping they'll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed.

Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas?

Here ... near the Anoat system.

A mining colony.

Can you trust him?

You look great.

Luke!  I'm sure he's fine.  Probably sitting around wondering what we're doing right now.

Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.

No hard feelings?

Hyperdrive.

Yeah, you're a real hero.

Good.  It would be most unfortunate if I had to leave a permanent garrison here.

I'm altering the bargain.  Pray I don't alter it any further.

Thanks.

I didn't say anything?

Are the coordinates set?

Closer?!

What did you say?!

What are you talking about?

Luke, no!  It's a trap.

No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.

No.  Try not.  Do, do.  Or do not. There is no try.

Size has no meaning.  It matters not.  Look at me.  Judge me by my size do you?

That is why you fail.

The dark side beckons.  But if once start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.  Consume you it will ... as it did Obi-wan's apprentice.

No!

Time will tell.

Anything on the Millennium Falcon?

They're...pretending to dress.

We know that.

My name is Cornelius.  And this is Zira -- my wife.

He's a gorilla.

I mean that in our 'primitive' civilization, apes just don't talk. I mean I think it's important that, when our 'primitive' security precautions are lifted, the first time you say something in public you should talk to what we 'primitively' call the Right People.

Now go get dressed. We have things to do.

Go on now. Do as I say.

Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you give your life. You fight till you're dead. Then I forgive you.  Understand?  Understand?

Where?

What's in it for me?

If I'm late, Carjack, don't start without me.

My name is no longer Carjack. Will you please get that through your fucking head?

Tell the President to adopt. I think I'll like L.A.

Lock fuel rods.

Yeah, I got it.

You're gonna have to learn to respect the law, Snake. The United States is a no- smoking nation. No smoking, no drinking, do drugs, no women unless you're married, no guns, no foul language. It's a brand new day for you, Snake.

So where's Plissken?

Cuervo's got a place near Venice, where the big birds fly. Nice digs, too. I've been there, y'know.

All right. Anything for you, Snake.  Although I was going to take you to Cuervo Jones' place.

I could've helped you. We coulda made a deal with Cuervo. If you'd listen...

I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man.

Bluebacks. I'm not bullshittin'. I swear to God.

Don't like it, don't come.

Who?

Are you crazy?

Oh no, it's the Doctor.

I don't know. Somehow, I just can't leave.

Give me the prototype.

I cannot--

--That is a wild boast. You lack a knight's humility.

Move aside!

I will not.

I sought only not to harm you, sir.

So be it, to the death.

I gave up my castles and my lands!

Ready my knights for battle; they will ride with their King once more. I have lived through others far too long! Lancelot carried my honor and Guenevere my guilt. My knights have fought my causes. Mordred carries my sins. Now, at last, I will rule.

That's not why you came.

Guenevere. And a beloved friend who will betray you.

Come now. So much anger for such a little crime? Are you sure there is nothing else troubling you?

Is this a dream? Tell me, Merlin!

I don't know. Merlin brought you to me when you were newly born and charged me to raise you as my own. At first, I did so because I feared Merlin, later because I loved you.

You.

I cannot love as a woman the lady who will be wife to my King and my friend. And, in pledging my love to you, I cannot love any other woman.

He has given up.

Can it truly be used for magic?

Flattery! Do you think I am ignorant of your stupid little games? Preying on you weakness of others. That's your power, a petty evil. Mine is great. Great plans. Impossible dreams. Laughable endings...

I won't. You would misuse such power. I have paid enough for you, and I will have you.

Just show the sword.

Dumb riddles, Merlin. I am your King.

I?

You strike me with words as hard as steel.

I didn't know that.

Thank you your excellency.

Look, I'm telling you again and you'd better believe it, I'm not about to put her in a goddamn asylum!

You're sorry. Christ, eighty-eight doctors and all you can tell me is all of your bullshit...

Hi, how'd your day go?

Oh great, anything else?

Maybe the circuit is busy?

What didn't he tell you?

Burke.

No. Not at all,

Please.

Really? wow.

No rats. Thanks a lot that's terrific.

What!

What man?

No thanks Karl.

Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.

Yes, I think so.

She used those words. Look, I doubt that she even understood what she was saying.

No. I'm building a new house, the old one's been sold. I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while, after she finished school here. Why d'you ask?

Not a psychiatrist! She needs a priest! She's already seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you, now you're gonna send me back to them! Jesus Christ, won't somebody help her!

You show me Regan's double: same face, same voice, same everything. I'd know it wasn't Regan. I'd know in my gut and I'm telling you that that thing upstairs isn't my daughter! And I want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there's nothing wrong with my daughter except in her mind! You tell me you know for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good! You tell me that!

Please.

What?

You like it?

The closet

No I do, Captain Howdy said no.

Captain Howdy.

I wouldn't talk.

You like him.

Your not gonna marry him are you?

Well I heard differently.

How do you know?

Why does God let us get tired?

My bed was shaking, I can't get to sleep.

Honey it's to help you.

That's good.

I came to say goodbye.

Who's in it?

You might loosen the straps then.

I'm not Regan.

And I'm the Devil! Now kindly undo these straps!

Intensely.

It would bring us together.

You and us.

Who places her trust in thee, my God.

She'll go into coma.

I don't know anyone who fits the description.

No I probably wouldn't.

That's to bad.

Alright. You know who I think really did it?

The Dominicans. Go pick on them.

You wanted to see me, Charlie?

Your pay.

Suit yourself.

You believe this?  The kid won't come out.  I'm playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom. There's nothing sharp in there, is there?

Teeth.

They're falling out.

I don't see any ladies here. Except maybe you.

Frank.

Huh?

I hate your kids, Frank.

Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.

No thanks.

I told you.  Something came up. Some political dinner or something.

If you're unhappy with the arrangement --

I just thought we should talk about it.  Between ourselves.

I was just thinking what Ma would think.

I didn't get her number.

Yeah, well, Your's isn't.  Let me run a comb though it.

I told you I was gonna hit you.

She's here.

That's what I figure.  Probably have us in a bed-and-breakfast playing to the owls.

I'll take my chances.

We do.  She's got hers, we've got ours. Hey. Wash and Dries.

Yeah.  You mind?

I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is --

Right.  I love you, Frank.

I'm sorry, Frank.  All that talk about family. I just got emotional.

Two hours ago!

What the hell are these?

How come I didn't hear anything?

Celebrating.  Join me?

February?

He was just having fun.

It was just a can of beer, Frank.

I can't make the tenth.

I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.

I play two hundred nights a year with you, Frank. How much more reasonable you expect me to be?

You want to know how much I got tied up in deposits with Willie?  We're in for three weeks solid, Jack.

I told you, Jack.  It's a telethon. No one gets a cent.

Dignity?  Who the hell are you to talk about dignity?

Yeah, I know.  Me, too.

I can keep the beat.

Yeah.

Thrilling.  Both of you.

A few empty tables.  It's cozier. Besides, Mel Torme couldn't fill this place on a Wednesday night.

No, no.  You boys are tired.

All right.

Uh-huh.  Well, Miss Moran, what is it you'd like to do for us?

Don't take it personally.

Okay.  I think that's all we need to know.

Where's my name?

Okay, okay.  Here, how about this?

Right.

They're nines.

So find a dime.  Let's get out of here.

First times. Hey, look at this.

Great.

No. We got a picture, though. One of the waitresses had a camera.  God, we were just kids.  That was something, wasn't it?

They must've bought the same map we did.

Jack woke up on the wrong side of the bottle.

Someone needs to grow up.  I won't take it, Jack.

Forget it.

Huh?

What?

Susie.  It's one more show.  One more time.  That's all.

That'd be me, sir.  Frank Baker. This is my brother Jack.

Job.

I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone who wore that shit.

You know, I'm feeling a lot of hostility from you.

Baker.  Jack Baker.

I'm tired.  Really.  I should get home.

It's been a long time, Ma.

Hey.  You feel like a cup of coffee?

You want me to walk you?

I mean, that'd be too creepy. With us working together and all.

No thanks.  I never touch French cigarettes.

Practice.  There are worse songs, you know. Not many, but a few.

Better than that.

Nothing.

Who's Nina?

Friend?  What's she look like? Maybe I can help you find her.

Nervous?

So, what happened?

We outgrew each other.

Huh?

Oh. Carrots.  And peas.  None of the important ones.

If I see him.

Losing his teeth.

Sounds big.  What's he do?

Is that what you used to do?

What are they?

I guess it's getting serious.

What's a prom?

Huh? Oh, no.

I'm not much for sweets.

Better than you bleeding all over my car upholstery. Trust me, Caz, you won't be here long.

How old is he?

He's your brother, you figure it out.  Maybe he made another bomb.

So?  The procnias averano is a South American bird.  The flight here was only three hours!  And yesterday a European swallow flew by! Where the fuck are we?

You porked his wife the day he was arrested.  How could you forget that?

What's worse than losing five million bucks?

It's important.

Must've been after we got engaged.

Eve, listen carefully.  The man you think is your husband -- isn't.

What more proof do you need?

Jon, what is it?

Apparently, fine.  He's coming into work.  That's the good news ...

He'd see that a mile away.  The only person he'd talk to about that bomb is his brother.  Unfortunately, turnips can't talk.

The left, I think.  Those surgeons in Witness Protection can fix things nobody's even broken yet.

I've been working night and day.  I haven't had time.

And how much will your "fun" net you this time?

Too late, your kid worships me.  And your wife -- she's an animal.  Even I can't keep up with her.

Not if I kill you first ...

I'm going to have you fired.

Pollux is -- what?

Walton, you have to let me see the warden --

Like you know anything about it.

You haven't changed at all! Some guy tries to rape me -- and you side with him!

Business first.  I went into the "Warrants" system and erased your records.  You're clean.  In fact, you're now on the informant payroll.

Are you TRYING to give us away? For somebody with such a big brain, you think awfully small.

Good, because I checked your salary -- and it bites.  How the everyday working-class stiff survives in today's economy is something I'll never ...

No problem.

Normally, I would.  But today ...

Me.  I have doubts about your ability to stick with what is essentially a desk job.

Done.  In fact, I was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs.

No.  Most of them are in transit by now.  I'm heading over to the hotel to personally oversee security.

It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?

Have fun at work.

-- I've got to study.

Call me spontaneous.

The world can wait, Jon. You're going.

Back then -- who wasn't?

You're a ray of sunshine, Jack.

Yeah Jack, her assistant...

You?  Married?

Excuse me?

Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.

That'll be a nice little holiday treat.

I don't want you to be sorry, Alan, I want you to be excited.  I want my gift to be the first one you open this year.  You know why?

Uh...actually, yes. Two... good ones.

Uh huh...one point seven. And what do you project for this year?

Whats going on here?

Im not worried, Mom. Hes still learning our ways...

Wheres my real dad?

Who did?

Sure.

Check...

Got it.  Good tip.

Mary Had A Little Lamb.

Is it...?

I dont think so.

She wants to have an affair with me.

So could you write down her exact address?

We bowl together. Were bowlers ...we won a championship...were winners.

Yes, thats it...yes, we went to high school together.

Yeah...I guess I just wanted you to know, we couldve been really good friends...

Ive got all the time in the world...

I don't do that.  That's just not for me...

You still think this is about me, don't you?

Give me my goddamn life back!

I glimpse?  A glimpse of what!?  What glimpse?! Glimpse!

Look, I just want my life back.  Now whats it gonna take?  You wanna talk turkey?  Lets talk turkey!  How much money...?

Ticket bad.  You draw in lines with pencil.

I dont think so, thank you...

It would help me if we were.

Look, I dont know whats going on here but I am Senior Vice President of this company.

Uh huh...

Well, Im just a little confused right now about why I work here...

Okay, chief.

What are you talking about?  Its me, Jack Campbell.  Penthouse C. I put you into commercial paper!

All in one tape?

You hear me complaining about that?

I dont know!  Please stop yelling at me!

Trust me on this Kate.  I really dont think going to a party is the right move for me at the present time.

Because youll be here.

I mean back in college, you were a very pretty girl, theres no question about that.  But this...  ...youve really grown into a beautiful woman...

Do what?

Its an unbelievable thing.  Wearing this suit actually makes me feel like a better person.  Im gonna buy it...

Maybe youre not.  The Jack Campbell I married wouldnt need a $2400 suit to make himself feel better about his life, but if thats what its gonna take, then buy it. Just buy the goddamn suit ...we can take the money out of the kids college fund.

Thats my piece.  I was saving it because I got nauseated from that store bought chicken.

Its good, right?

Wait a minute.  Youre my wife?

Enjoy it, sweetheart...

Ill fix it.  Ill go out right now and get you something.  Ill make it right.

Are you sure?

Your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks.

Ill just full yours up to the top.  Happy anniversary, sweetheart.

Thats all I wanted to hear...

I dont think Id fight you on that one...

No, this is the center of the universe.  If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else?  Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon.

Promise me again...

Im moving to Paris...it was right here...  Its a box marked Jack.  I put it in the stack for the Salvation Army...

Thats the one...

Not with what they pay me...

Jack.

Where is he?

You suddenly having trouble getting dates?

Thats easy. Youve seen my car.

Of course I did.

Congratulations. The La Guardia flights canceled but I got you out of Kennedy on United at nine. Am I good or what?

I wouldn't know anything about that.

Tell me.  When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then.  You didn't listen to people.  So why start now...?

You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.

Ben.  This is business.  Just work.

Ben, the money's not important.  We could <u>save lives</u>.

External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --

He's made a few changes.

Victor's better at these things.

Ben.  This is serious.  <u>Turn around</u>.

Well maybe <u>you</u> should date him.

Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.

Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.

What is this?  Where's Reed?

And you can?  Power it up?

Victor must've taken him.

Ben, are you there?

This place is deluxe.  You got cable?

Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're...well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through.  And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?

They're not costumes.

Right, whatever, have fun.

Last one down springs for room service.

<u>Girl</u>...?!

So reel him in.  But we came here to do a <u>job</u>.  So let's do it.  <u>Quickly</u>.

Reed, we're running out of time.

<u>I</u> ruined?  With all due respect, I told you to abort --

Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll.  You remember my brother Johnny...

Yes, thanks.

What...?  <u>Oh</u>.

Anger.  Rage.  Frustration.

Are you kidding?

With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm.  Maybe tie into the city grid...

I'm sure I can come up with something.

Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps.  And this is the biggest step yet.  If it helps, think of this as a <u>promotion</u>.  A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...

Just <u>find</u> him.

Please, no apologies.  I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos.  You'll have round-the clock care.

Here's the overall Target Area...

Medical's ready.

Phase Two.

No...

In his comatose state...and everything slowed down...no more than sixty seconds.

The Other Side got to him.

Here's the Surgeon.

Come along, they'll be operating shortly.  See you later, Mike.

Attack? Who -- or should I say what from?

I don't agree. Just because he's often difficult --

Yes...slowed down agreat deal.

I don't know yet, Doctor. And I won't know until I test it.

You sound as if you're not looking forward to it.

I think it's the most exciting --  We're going to see things no one ever saw before. The actual physical process of Life itself -- not something under a microscope... Just think of it --

You may learn to like it.

Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval. The beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter.

I've been with him since I got out of school. He brought me into the CMDF, over five years ago.

I can't till the hatch is flooded!

Under a cloud without cause, I take it.

Well, if you happen to be very fond of him -- even in love with him -- it would certainly affect your point of view.

Take a close look at your Soul, and your Infinity, and your God out there --

You left something out.

Maybe we can...  Skipper, is there a snorkel on this sub?

It I can clear this Central Nerve, that <may> be enough...

If there's any chance --

There's no other way. Tie my safety line to the sub.

Walt for the lull -- between the time he inhales and exhales.

Send the following message...

We're safe -- long as it remains that color...  We're in the Pleural Sac.  It keeps the Lungs from rubbing against the Wall of the Chest up there. When those membranes become inflamed, we wind up with Pleurisy -- and a wracking cough.

I saw the laser just before we started. It was fastened down securely. You don't suppose what happened was an 'accident?' Any more than my safety line snapping after it was tied off to the sub?

That line was tampered with...

Reticular fibers. We ought to be clear of them soon.

Just what it is. Antibodies, destroying Bacteria -- or any other foreign invader that threatens the System.

No, we should reach the base of the Brain shortly. And from there, it's not far to the site of the injury.

I thought I was on my vacation... What's it all about?

I'm married.

We can get out through the Lab Section.

Could I run a tube through that Wall, without harming Benes?

Yeah, I just came in. I decided not to park here.

May I have your ticket, please?

Unghh... oh, geez...

What's this, sir?

...What're you talking about?

What're you, nuts? We had pancakes for breakfast. I gotta go somewhere I can get a shot and a beer - and a steak maybe.  Not more fuckin' pancakes. Come on.

No.

Geez. That's more'n I've heard you say all week.

HOLD ON! NO FUCKIN' WAY! YOU FUCKIN' NOTISH ISH? I GOT FUCKIN' SHOT INNA FAISH! I WENT'N GOTTA FUCKIN' MONEY! I GET SHOT FUCKIN' PICKIN' IT UP!  I BEEN UP FOR THIRTY-SHIKSH FUCKIN' HOURZH! I'M TAKIN' THAT FUCKIN' CAR! THAT FUCKERZH MINE!

You want your own wife kidnapped?

This was s'posed to be a no-rough stuff-type deal -

Well, I'm sorry, but I just - I -

Now we had a deal here! A deal's a deal!

Don't you fucking but me, Jerry.  I want you with this money on the Dayton- Radisson parking ramp, top level, thirty minutes, and we'll wrap this up.

You're there in thirty minutes or I find you, Jerry, and I shoot you, and I shoot your fucking wife, and I shoot all your little fucking children, and I shoot 'em all in the back of their little fucking heads. Got it?

Yah, but I'm sayin', that TruCoat, you don't get it and you get oxidization problems. It'll cost you a heck of lot more'n five hunnert -

Yah, but this TruCoat -

One hundred! You lied to me, Mr. Lundegaard. You're a bald-faced liar!

End a April.

Officer Olson.

Oh sure.

What'd this guy look like anyways?

Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr. Mohra. You're right, it's probably nothin', but thanks for callin' her in.

Yah, got a front movin' in.

Was he funny-looking apart from that?

Yah?

Yeah!

Yah, right -

Dad! What're they doing? Wuddya think they're doin' with Mom?

What if - what if sumpn goes wrong?

My father-in-law, he's the owner.

The car's not from our lot, ma'am.

Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.  You're damned hard to get on the phone.

I'm sure they do - ha ha! But I can't read their serial numbers here. So if you could read me -

No, fax is no good, that's what I have and I can't read the darn thing -

No, no, fax is -

This is Reilly Deifenbach at GMAC. Sir, I have not yet received those vehicle IDs you promised me.

Good day, sir.

It's okay, Scotty.

Shep said you'd be here at 7:30. What gives, man?

We been sitting here an hour.  I've peed three times already.

Yeah, okay. Well, siddown then.  I'm Carl Showalter and this is my associate Gaear Grimsrud.

Yah, okay.

I thought you were gonna show it to Stan Grossman. He passes on this stuff before it gets kicked up to me.

Well, they -

Mm.

Put you in touch with Grimsrud.

Margie. Thought you might need a little warm-up.

Yah, looks pretty bad. Two of'm're over here.

I'm fine - it's just morning sickness.

I'm not sure I agree with you a hunnert percent on your policework, there, Lou.

Aw, Norm.

Great. What brings ya down - are ya down here on that homicide - if you're allowed, ya know, to discuss that?

I think I remember Linda, yah.  She was - yah. So things didn't work out, huh?

I always liked ya so much...

It's okay...

It's okay, Mike...

Uh-huh.

Well, I'm sorry I won't see ya.

Yah, he - he's been struggling. He's living with his parents now.

Oh. Gary's loudmouth.

They're real good.

Yah, ya think?

Yah.

Oh, for Pete's - a course they do! Every time they raise the darned postage, people need the little stamps!

His wife's in the hospital, has been for a couple months. The big C.

Congratulations, Jerry.

The garden.  Take him there.  Move, people.  Let's do this!

Sir, you're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior.

I'm sorry, I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.

I'm afraid I have to insist you leave.

...using steroids.  I was a juicer. Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for racehorses, for Christsake.  Now I'm bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids won't return my calls...

Really, what's that?

Look at my face.

Yes?

You want to see pain?  Swing by First Methodist Tuesday nights.  See the guys with testicular cancer.  That's pain.

What?

Practicing what?

A year?  How'd you manage that?

You can't have both parasites.  You can take blood parasites --

I've been going to debtor's anonymous.  You want to see some truly fucked up people?

This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.

Don't worry, I'm leaving.

Nothing.

No... no problem.

I could check your prostate.

Well... thanks, anyway.

Have we been talking too long?  Must we change the subject?

What?

Answer the question!

What is wrong with you?

I mean, the depth and breadth of our relationship has only recently been illuminated for me.  I know this... I know us hasn't been such a great thing for you...

Who's this?

What?

Please return your seatbacks to their full upright and locked position.

Now, find your power animal.

Why?  So you can say, "Oh, that's what you do." -- And be a smug little shit about it?

The spork.  I get it.  You're very clever.

Keep it up, then.  Keep it right up.

I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

Is it?

What fight?

After I graduated, I called him long distance and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "Get a job."  When I turned twenty-five, I called him and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "I don't know. Get married."

"I get cancer, and I kill Joe."

Soldier of Fortune.  Business Week. New Republic.

Good answer.

Abe Lincoln.  Big reach.  Skinny guys fight till they're burger.

He was obviously able to handle it.

She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home.

Yes, I promise.

Don't mention me.

No, what you're feeling is premature enlightenment.

We don't... ?

Work.  Going to work.

Nothing.  Do what you like.

Homework assignment.

An expired community college student ID card.  What did you used to study, Raymond K. Hessel?

Imagine how he feels.

I felt like destroying something beautiful.

What should I have told you?

Fight club was the beginning.  Now it's out of the basements and there's a name for it -- Project Mayhem.

Look...

What are you doing?!

What's this all about, Tyler?

Answer me, Tyler.

What... what are you saying?

What about Marla?

You... you can't be serious about this.

You don't know that.  There could still be people inside.

If you know, I know.

Fuck your struggle.  I want out.

What?

i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...

Fifteen seconds now.  Can you see alright?  10... 9... 8....

You need me.

... no, no, no...

I swear on my life, I won't...

Not my mouth.  Our mouth.

It's the only way to get rid of you...

No!

We have a deal worked out with Irvine.

Yes, it is.

We need some towels, Lou.  We need replacement light bulbs.

How'd you know?

Yesssss...

Why?

I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up... I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.

Death's list.  The precise order you're going to die in.

Congratufuckinglations.  That makes you last to go.  But don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you.  Always does.

I hope you're ready for this.

So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby.

How you doing in there, hero?

I have to save Eugene!

Holy shit.  He said "only new life can defeat death."  If she gives birth to a baby that was never meant to be born, a brand new soul that was never part of Death's Design...

We need to hurry.

If only Alex and I had done that with the others, Alex might still be...

Evan Shaeffer's dead.  Guess he wasn't as lucky as we thought.

Maybe.  What's this about?

...My Premonition was just like his.

Clean up?  I don't...

Hold on.

We have to tell her she's in danger!

How do you know?

No time.  Keep going.  I wouldn't know how to explain any of this anyway.

I know.  I can feel it too.

Yeah, don't make me cite you for harassment.

Get ready to smile, five guys per girl.

You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?

I know, we'll be there soon.

Jeez, Mom, stop trippin'.

Yeah, but everything's always in transition. If you focus, even now, one week into summer... you can feel Autumn coming.  Almost like bein' able... to see the future.

It is. But that didn't stop me. Shouldn't stop you.

I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere.

What if Tod... is just the first... of us?

As in flannels and plaids?

No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design.

We're takin' you to a cabin in the woods, it's only a couple miles from my house.  Keep off the highways, they'll be lookin' for us.

Get out! Get out of the car!

Why do you think I was hiding?

Been on many planes that blew up, have you?

"Next?"

Why would he pull at the wire if he were committing suicide?

'Cause if you say another word, I'm gonna fuckn' kill ya!

They're watching me, see if I go to Alex.

May as well go out under my own free will, right?

I'm not afraid! I DECIDE WHEN IT'S TIME! I control my life! I control my death!

There's the Mekong.

Clown?  Now back up there, buddy...

No.

Buddhist monastery.  Fifteenth century.

Fermented fish sauce.

Who cares?  Let's just do it and get out.  Go have a Jacuzzi and get laid in Bangkok.  Know what I mean?

Powerful warrior.

Guard barracks.  Take some shots.

Duck soup.

It's a Soviet MIL MI-24.  Probably has 12.7mm nose cannon, heat-seeking rockets and wire guided missiles, plus...

Sure.  I only sound like forty-year- old in your language.

Yes.  But I lose many merits in next life.  Very bad.

You think you are... .

In-vul-nerabo.  But you get ass kicked without me.

I couldn't get you in.

How?

We like you.  At least the computer at Langley likes you.  Pulled your file because of various factors.  Service record. Area familiarity.

What's the plan?

Sir, there's something else... a TRANSAT relay.  Just came through.

What?

About 22 hours on site.

Couple hours.  Let me buy you a coffee.

That's a crock.  We don't say that. Do you have any idea the shitstorm if he'd gotten back with that guy? If it went public?  The White House would have to act through channels. We're talking ransom.  Four billion bucks in war reparations to Vietnam to get the others back.  That's billion, Colonel.  With a "B".  For a few guys that've had their brains in a blender for ten years?  A pain in the ass to everybody?  No way. There's no way.

Can you walk?

Yeah.  Big time.

Keep it clean, Rambo, or I'll nail your hide to the shed.

Well did you or didn't you?

Ah... I do them myself.  I used to work in a beauty parlor.

It's an awful thing, let me tell you. My Aunt used to say,  "divorce is the sister-in-law of death".

Do I look like I have someone special?

Meeting ... people.

I can't believe you lived with her for that long. If I had to live with my mother, I'd stab myself six times.

Because it makes me feel good to see how not funny it is and how America doesn't know the first thing about funny which makes it easier not being a famous funny TV celebrity because that would just mean that I'm not really talented.

I was attacked.

Two kids tried to set me on fire.

No, I'm fine... really...

Oh stop.  Things will change.  My Aunt Mary always said, there's a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class.

...<u>Forget it</u>... <u>Goodbye</u>!

And who's Lydia?

What does that mean?

He just needs some clothes?

Who's knows. My Aunt Marge used to say, "some matches are made in heaven, some are made in hell and some are made in hardware stores".

Slowed things down?  Where have I been?  Have we been going fast!?

All right... I'll pack my stuff tonight.

<u>Listen</u>!  We both got something out of it, all right!

He can't hear you.  Hi...I'm Dr. Weintraub....  I was on duty when they brought him in...I've been going over his record... He was brought in once before I understand...  ..."catatonic  stupor"...condition  rendered him non-verbal for a period of -...

Okay... I know but... I met this beautiful girl...

I'm... just looking for Parry...

You can ask.

Fine.  I'll say no.

Yeah?  Who is this?

Well, congratulations Lydia, because out of several thousand card holders... in conjunction with several major credit card companies...

Yes.  They're free.

How much?

Tonight!  How's tonight?

What girl?  I didn't notice.

Lydia.  Lydia what?

The Little People?

Oh, please... you're embarrassing me.

Thanks a mill --  And I'll give you a buzz as soon as I hear from the people upstairs and we'll get this thing off the ground... Thanks for stopping by, Jack.  Give my love to the wife and kids.

Parry!

Well what am I gonna do with it?

You really want to help me?

Look, you're only sort of insane, really. People like you can lead semi-normal lives. You could get a job...

I take it back - you're fucking deranged... And you're going to get yourself killed trying to get in there!

That's why the Little People sent you. Just <u>like</u> magic.

Who?

It's a classic.

Well that's stupid. This is my park just as much as it is theirs. You think it's fair they keep us out just because they make us think we'll get killed or something?

Who are you talking to Jack?

Well, see, I think she can help...You know women are great..they...they make homes and they..ya know, kill the livestock so the knights can go out and get Grails and...and slaughter villages with a clear head...I mean, where would Arthur be without Guinevere...

<u>Parry</u>!  Close your pants...

Tch...how romantic. Yeah. If I wasn't already committed to Lydia, boy. Except Anne'd never go for me though. She loves you too much. And you really love her, huh?

No. Nothing bad's going to happen. Anne'll be there. I'll be there. Nothing bad will happen.

Yeah.....Hey they're moving....  Am I doing that?

It sounds exciting.

You don't have to say that.

Listen, you're very nice... b...

You have a disease.

Twinky?

Well, lemme play the other side then.

I'm too moved by your gentility to speak.

Will you just do what the hell I tell you...

You got another ball comin'.

Yes.

You treat me like I was.

Do you love me, Bobby?

You'll be gone, period.

Shut up! All of you!

Is what you?

Who said I was depressed?

Oh, you're not going to kill yourself this time. I wish I'd known...

I have to see how things are first. My father's sick, you understand? They wouldn't be prepared for me bringing anyone.

If you can't do what I ask, Ray, use that money to go back home, then.

Oh, am I holdin' up dessert?

I don't, huh?

I can't talk to you right now, leave me alone...

Washington.

Where are you going?

Yeah. That's before the big thaw.

What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?

Well, you seem very professional...

Would you tell her Bobby's here?

Now don't...

You know who it once belonged to?

Crashes into a Jeep and totals his neck.  That's Carl...

Uhm hmm. Some range.

Yes, it is. I can't take seeing him, sitting there like a stone.

Well, do you -- I mean, have you enjoyed all these... strange things you've been doing?

No, I don't really think you're a freak.

What about Carl and Catherine? Is he just coaching her, or what?

You know, he was formerly a sailor.

Sailors are sadistic, I feel.

My turn.

Bye, Robert.

I guess you fell in the water.

Playing piano all day and then jumping into cold water. You could get a cramp.

I have played a few times. Here and there. As a matter of fact, I was once a rehearsal pianist for a Las Vegas musical revue.

Yes, that's what's important to me...

That's right.

What?

Of course I'd like to.

Will you let me talk to you, please?

I hope it will, yes.  I'm sorry.

No, the last time was three years ago.

Your serve. Two -- Eighteen.

That's what I mean...

Will you shut up for a minute!!  Pull your car out of line.

Well, thank you, that's a very nice thing for you to say.

I do eat slow as a bird, whereas Bobby can put it away like a speed swing...  Is there any ketchup around?

Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.

Oh, my, "a summit conference." I wonder where I was, polishing silver behind the coal bin.

Not dirt. See, dirt isn't bad. It's filth. Filth is bad. That's what starts maggots and riots...

What do you mean "mass"... I have to come out and tell you, you're not that clean, either.

And they picked up! I mean, it wouldn't be filthy, with Coke bottles and whiskey, and those signs everywhere...

The TV. There's some good things on it, sometimes.

Aaron, how you doin'?

So get the fuck outta here.

Now she's tellin' me what the fuck to do.

Is it true?

Victor.

Wussup.

No.  What you do today?

I just wanted to see you.

Of course.

You got a boyfriend?

I can't, I'm gonna get punished more!

I won't let my motha cut my hair.

C'mon.

If we were at 10th Street Pool you woulda done it right in the water, right?

Yeah.

Yeah.

She didn't say she had no man.

Your friend must be misinformed.

Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her.

What?

So, then whadda ya want?

Yeah.

You mean her.

Fletch, this is dumb.

I busted their window, they didn't do anything.

It was planted on me, sir.

Not a prayer.

Your 'foolproof' way is going to land my ass on the front page while you're basking in Rio.

Yes.

No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.

I'll bet. Shame about Ed.

Fletch...

You don't know me.

Affirmative.

I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or --

Wait five minutes, and go to my office. You'll get federal protection after that.

Where am I?

It's all right. It wasn't him but that spleen was a splitting image.

I hate to conduct business on the lanai. Why don't we step inside.

That's history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred and eighteen dollars.

This is no joke. If some kind of payment isn't made, we're going to have to contact the paper and garnish your wages.

Wait a second --

Pretty hefty. Keep reading.

Whoops.

Yes. Where you from, Harry?

Check.

That's right. Alan comes by every three weeks or so.

What the hell does this have to do with insurance?

No problem.

I know.

What?

Yeah. Maybe.

Nugent. Ted Nugent.

I want it done Thursday evening, around eight PM. My wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. It's the staff's night off.  These will be open.

Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.

Precisely. Are you a good shot?

You've certainly thought this out, haven't you?

I'm sorry?

Cute thing.

Oh, mine! Thank God.  Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's?

I can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning.

You are a rich woman.

No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today.

Yes.

God...

Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry.

Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.

He never sees them and I never met them.

How do you know about that?

Trust you? I may seem a little goofy at times, but I'm not a complete Bozo, you know.

Gail, please.

I checked. There was no divorce.

I'm calling the police. Right now.

Don't tell me I can't --

Great. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich.

In her cabana, sir.

Cabana one.

Would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir?

Sierra del fuego.

Who are you?

Go ahead. Call them. Better tie your shoelaces first.

Uh, almost.

And a damn fine one, I might add.

Irwin...

Well, there we're in a gray area.

Cool your tool, Frank, I need a little more time. I think I'm really on to something here.

You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.

I want something I can print!

What...

I'm sick of this place. I'm going to try out for the Lakers. They need a power forward.

Frieda's boss.

My secretary.

Mrs. Stanwyk, I hate to disturb you. Tom Underhill here... I'm a new member.

Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g...

I'm sorry, that's gotta be a pair of tube socks he has down there.

Have what?

Lots of things.  Her favorite yogurt.  The ten drummers she would take to a desert island...

But I am...

Man, ever since old Jack Grendel died, Julian has got me into one yummy gig after the other.  Not only am I producing, he's got me in some lovely-bullshit-money-money executive position.  What are you looking at...

Could somebody tell me what's going on?  <u>Like slo-owly</u>...

Exactly.

'Bye Ford...'  Hey, let me cheer you up.  I found the IN X S payment.

Rock stars!  I'm going out of my mind.  All I get are perks.  I don't make money, I make gifts. How am I supposed to pay taxes with bathtub compact disc players and autographed drumsticks.  I want cash.  Moulah.  Wampum.  Dead Presidents.  Andrew Jackson. Gerald Ford.

I found a lot of Art Mooneys. None with a police record, though. Not even Synchronicity.  Have you checked out Johnny Pinzolo/Crunch's houseboat yet?

Go on, 'they're stahting.'

Shut up, goodies from the ice queen.

No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?  I mean, she is what this case is about.

Ms. Sutton hired you to find the girl.  Period.

Yeah, let's bury her.

Let's get her out of here, before she starts a shoot-out.  Drop us at my place.

What are you doing at the office? You wouldn't believe what I've gone through tonight... I'm calling from the Mega Beta Pogo Sorority.

You're not funny.

Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.

Scalping to a funeral, you're a pretty sleazy guy.

Fluck you!

Give me your gum and grab the wheel.

Peachy.

I'm so sure!  I'm an only child and my parents are Bill and Shirley Petals of South Bend, Indiana. They run a hardware store and...

Friends?  You didn't tell me that.

ArtArtArtArtMooneyMooneyMooney Mooney.

Tell me, Dr. Watson, what makes you think he's not just another piece of shit overdose.

Jesus, how could you be so stupid?  Come on, we're going to a hospital.

Yeah, and that lead singer, Jesus, that white Van McCoy wanna-be with the six-inch platform shoes. He looked...

You were the lead sing -- Lieutenant, I didn't think anyone could cheer me up tonight... Thanks.  Really.

I'm off it!

<u>I.  Am.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.</u> <u>In.  The.  Whole.  Fucking.  World</u>.

You gotta be kidding!  This is unfuckingbelievable!  I have to start the evening crawling down Capital Records, I shoulda chose suicide then, but oh no, the night was young!  Next up, my guitar! The second most important thing I own and now it's toothpicks for the homeless on Hollywood Boulevard!  Then, then, after I burned up your brother, Jazz... I should say as a fucking footnote I've usually treated women like shit -- used corsages, the wet spot, you know giving out Domino's Pizza's phone number and saying it's mine... Tonight was different. I felt respect.  I felt love.  Then Jazz left me... and <u>now</u> I get to die!

Boing.  You're one hell of a lip reader.

Go on, another time, another place.

Shock.

Golly, I'd probably faint.

Yeah, yeah, I know the third one unscrambles the high bits and the low bits.  Shit, just start torturing me, man.  I didn't even know Johnny had a disc and I can't deal with any 'Don't play games with me, Mr. Fairlane' bullshit.

I'm running a little late.  You see, I'm having a party at <u>THE</u> Club to introduce the new lead singer for Black Vomit.  Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland.

Before Black Vomit starts its set, Don will have his head blown off. The papers next week will reveal that he was partners with Bobby, Johnny, and Collie in 'the Grendel Records scam.'  He killed them to pay off a debt to 'the mob' or something lame like that.  And then the mob iced him.  It's all more tasteful than it sounds.

Are you okay?

Oh please, Ford, I'll do any --

You're a poet and didn't know it.

Only on a first name basis.

I'll tell you when somebody pays me to give a shit and stuff.

Hebedeebuh.  Hebedeebuh.  Maybe I did die in the explosion.

It is to us!  It's computerised.

It's my daughter, man.  I know I never told you about her, but God, I love that girl.  She calls herself Zuzu Petals and she's been swallowed up by the gorgeous hell that is L.A. A fucking groupie partying with the pros.  You have to get my baby back, she's my pride and --

I don't take cases with foundations in bullshit.  They are very hard to walk around in.

You know I hadda meet some people tonight --

Where'm I goinna get a pizza this time o' night?

Who's this --

You must take me for an imbecile. Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?  I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a gendarme.

Are you having trouble raising the half million?

Encore du sho ping!

Avec ça tu pourras le supporter.

Formidable!  Sans toi je m'habillerais encore en docker.  Je suis passé voir Françoise.

Not any woman, Marie.  Just one.

Je crois qu'on fait une erreur de le prendre avec nous.

Mmm.

He got off on six.

Perhaps he's visiting a guest.

What's he do?

Where the hell is it?

Morning.  Sometime.

Look.  My partner and I found this case and I don't want no Feds screwing it up.

He coulda been white.

Not a chance.

Suspicion of what?

Yeah.

We also got Bill Mulderig and Phil Klein.

Four.

Forty dollars -- was $250.

Just for mistakes of parking?

I been damn careful up to now.

You go to Xavier High School, Daryl?

You remember Mary Finelli?

So what?

Just missed Deleon.  Hayes is up in the squad.

No, I think he's up in interrogation.

Hey, Rookie.  Be cool.  Just stay with me.  This is what we do.

Stay with me, Gib.  We're gonna do this.

The usual.

I tucked him in at Gordo's.

I gotcha, I gotcha Chief!

Okay, okay.  I need to go say something to Julia and finish up with the guy on the radio.

Uh, huh.

He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...

I'll be up soon, Little Chief.

No, but we can.  We can do it together. Spirit and guts, Chief.

I'm doing it!  I'm doing it!

Pal, my whole life's an emergency.

Queens, New York.

Yeah.  It was all over after Buford nailed Seaver's first pitch outta the park.

This afternoon?

What'd you just say?

What the hell does Gordy have to do with it?

What?

My dad's name was Frank Patrick Sullivan, he was a fire fighter and a die-hard Mets fan.  And every night when I went to bed he sang to me...  Take me out to the ball game, take me out with the crowd...

I'm thirty-five years old.

No Dad, it happened a long time ago, a long time ago for me.

What if the radio stops working?  Christ, what if I can't reach you again?

Tell 'em there's a homicide in progress... cause by the time they show up there will be.

Did you see him?  Do you know who he is?

I'm right here, Dad.

Yeah, I think so...

What?

Okay, okay...

Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?

Oh don't worry kid, I know where you live.  Now I want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy Yahoo. You got that Space Cowboy.  Y-a-h-o-o. It's a magic word and I never want you to forget it.

Yeah.  That's it.

That wasn't luck, Johnny boy.  That was smarts and ten plus on the job.

Sounds good.

No kidd'n, he musta been pushing 90!

Oh, I loved it.  I wish you'd gone.

No.  No.  Well, sort of.  In my heart. Been dead 29 years.

I hear that.

I'm the train wreck you didn't see coming.  And I'm gonna steal your life away.  You went down 30 years ago.  You just don't know it yet.

Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.

You have the right to speak to an att --

We were looking for something to keep our hands busy.  It was either this or an orgy.  Vera chose this.  What're ya gonna do?

Actually, I have no idea what the World's Record is.  I was just kidding.

Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

We haven't looked in the barn, yet.  Let's take a look.

First we take off our clothes, then you get on top of me or I get on top of you...

Chuck... look.

I can't even remember what day it is, man.

Will you come with me?

Your bed.

Why?

Is that so bad?

I'm here with you.  Can't that be enough for now?

Sort of.

Come on, Shelly.  Who else is gonna give him a lift?

A few minor repairs and it'll be as good as new.

Being a jerk is better than being nothing.

You don't to say it.  I can tell.

Great.  Just great.

Alright, alright.

No way...  ...I wanna rock!

Well, who told me to take this cow path?

That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.

You don't know for sure.  What about Roy?  Nobody's seen him.

Yeah, but the game's not over until it's over.

My ass.

When you stop acting like one... Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. And you...

You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.

We have!  Trying to track you down.  The phone there is disconnected.

'Cause it stinks.

It probably wouldn't have any effect on him.  The only sure way to stop Jason is to return him to his original resting place, where he drowned in 1957.

No, he was real.  Like on TV.

I found it outside.

Boy scouting.

I think somebody's messin' around out there.

Hold it.  Whoa... What's your name, son?

Yeah...They should've paid their bill.

How many times has Jason been reported killed before, Mr. Campbell?

Yeah, that'd be a big shame...

Yes.

So let's talk.

You know he's not...and he's coming for you.

Do you have to ask?

Okay, I'll call you later.

Why don't you blow me, Chief.  After your girlfriend gets through.

Sorry.

That's all right.  I was just...

Next, you dial a number.

Oh, c'mon, would you stop, please?

What am I gonna do -- I'm locked up in a friggin' cell?!

About what?

She did!

Never.

Disgusting?  Bingo night was sold out for six months after that!  They raised enough money to build a day care center.

She's a waitress at Joey B's but she needs some extra cash.  Ward's the pimp.

I have her in Creative Writing and she's fairly nice.

There's nothing to worry about, Suzy. The guy's dead now, somewhere at the bottom of this lake...if you believe the stories.  Let's drop it, okay?

So there's no reason for him to come back because there won't be any of us around...right?

Rennie's not coming.

It's...dead.

They're out of town.

I packed it. Just for us.

And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do.

No, I think it's just the beginning.

Where is she?

Walking corpses are not real!

He's the son of the Captain, for Chrissakes. You'd think he'd be able to operate this thing!

What are you talking about?

I don't think that's such a safe idea

You're telling a lie.

I don't even know why I'm afraid, Uncle Charles. I can't even remember when it started. Don't you think it's time I found out and got over it?

I'm staying.

I refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship.

Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles will be.

Really?

There's something I haven't told you...

I gathered that.

What is your location?

The LORAN has a digital printout of your latitude and longitude. Give me the coordinates and we'll be there as quick as we can.

Hi, Sean.

I'd love to.

Not completing a voyage is against everything he stands for. But I think I can convince him to call a Coast Guard cutter for you.

Where are they?

You are going where?

That's where I peed.

Paisley Porter. I didn't know you were waiting tables.

I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.

Don't needle me, Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. We're suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do.

Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.

Shit. They don't have any carrot soup.

What was it like?

Do we care?

Do not inhale.

About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn't tell me who.

She was very evasive.

Did you see the winning run score?

Let's work on it.

This could be it.

Does what feel comfortable?

She's dying.

About what?

We don't even like each other, do we?

I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.

Why do you need a radio?

You're too young to be studying criminal behavior. It's making you obsessive.

Don't call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom?

I have a class. I'm late.

Except I won't have a father anymore.

Names are incredibly intimate. We barely know each other. Trust me on this.

An artistry and sensitivity you've never shown before.

Two-all after six.

We stranded five runners in the first two innings. This will come back to haunt us.

Who the hell cares?

You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.

I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.

I don't know if I can say that.

Washed away.

What did it say?

Normal boy's ambition. I like coming back. You know that.

Show him who we are.

Oh yeah?

Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.

That's a simple subject.

That's my cousin, Angelo.

Matthew.

Because God loves a winner.

hat was this morning.

How come?

Because he is so deeply hated by so many people in the business.

Burnt sienna.

We have a very nice pasta today. Alla Putanesca.

Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.

Yes.

Our Steven not only disguises himself.

I'm actually beginning to enjoy this.

I haven't come to you.

Of course it's unfair. The truth is always unfair. Why do you think I live this way? Hiding out. Stealing electricity from a lamp post. Because people who write the truth are outcasts of society. I can't live openly, in a nice clean doorman building, with my name on the mailbox. They'd come after me in packs.

Are you sure?

In this place there are no untouchables -- and no work is beneath any of us!

There's no room! And the air is lovely.

Stop!

Nothing's more dangerous, especially for an old man.

Did they take your clothes?

Ah, but my puritanism runs the another way. I'm far too modest for such a display.

Lots of hair... and a little like a college freshman -- trying to figure everything out.

No, no -- just a moment, please.

I thought you were against fighting.

The Government's afraid, and they don't know what to do. But they're more afraid of terrorists than of you. The Viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non- violence.

I say when is now -- and we will determine how.

Good.  Ba will have to teach you to spin too.

You should ride the pony. It is not necessary to walk to prove the point.

That was England.

I can. But I risk being kicked into the gutter by someone less "holy" than Mr. Baker.

No. You were the surprise. It's been all over the prison. We thought they'd be too afraid of the English press.

I congratulate them.

I assure you I feel a very ordinary man at this moment.

Yes -- yes. It's just that... in these clothes I'd -- I'd prefer to go by taxi.

I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.

Who's leading them?

...an eye for an eye making the whole world blind.

I will prove it to you.  Come swim with me now, Vincent.  Now--tonight.

Now is your chance to find out.

Er, no...

Don't worry.  You'll probably do just as well singing to him in the womb.  We can implant the most successful pre-embryo tomorrow afternoon.

By the way, I left some trash in your locker.

This <i>is</i> the most likely location--

I'll take it out of your damn <i>pension</i> if you question my authority one more time!

We have to be certain.  Once they're up, we can hardly turn the boat around.

This time I will supervise each test personally.

Jerome--?

Again?

Yeah.  You want to go dancing tonight?

You had to be a right-hander.

Leave?  Just a few million years ago every atom in this hair--in our bodies--was a part of a star. I don't see it as leaving.  I see it as going home.

Hey, how much of you can be there?  Even if the "J. Edgars" do find something, in a week--  you'll be slightly out of their jurisdiction.  Come on, we've got to get drunk immediately.

Keep going!!  Keep going!!

It's okay, Eugene.

I'm proud of you, Vincent.

What are you talking about?

In a corridor.

I don't feel too good.  I think I'm still drunk from last night.

In case you get back before I do.

I got the better end of the deal.  I just lent you my body--you lent me your dream.

They are not babies, Maria, merely "human possibilities".

I've found him too.

I've been asked to compile a log for the investigators--they want to know everyone's whereabouts last night.

Why would we do that?

What exactly is wrong?

Of course.

I guess somebody beat me to it.

You've never been here?  Let me order for you.

You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender.  Looked right instead of left.

That's precisely what <i>scares</i>me--that they won't do anything <i>foolish</i> or <i>courageous</i> or <i>anything</i>--worth a Goddamn.

I'll tell you at the end of the week.

Need any more, you can always get it off his shoes.

This is the only time you and I meet in public. Any business with me, handle it with him...

They're mine. The one with the moustache is my brother. They stay out of it. We stay clean.

They will be ready. You guys do your job.

They may nail me into this now, McCoy.

You know, you and I may be two of a kind.

You still don't get the picture do you? I've always heard what a smart ass operator you are.

So we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.

Hi.

I want to take a walk.

What do you mean? You've never been there.

Small town, small bank, big money.

After four years and now the question comes up.

I'm still here, Doc.

But I got you out. Didn't I, Doc. I did it. I got you out.

Want to cry now?

At least you were outside.

Call the ranch, tell Beynotr we'll leave his cut here --

I've never "been there... When we met it was in his office.

There wasn't any way to explain it.

Maybe we should split up... I'll cut the money with you.

No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on.

Why, there's nothing on the news?

If I hadn't killed Beynon., you would have.

I don't think we can any more... If we ever get out of here, maybe I should take off...

I'll be ready.

What's wrong?

They will have our description before we can get a plane.

Pull over.

Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.

Yeah, why not? We're the good guys.

No, I'm afraid not.

Tell her you robbed a bank...

Two boxes of double-ought buck.

What about the vault?

Whatever you need.

Suit yourself.

Mexico. I'd like to find a quiet place to cross.

Juarez - Chihuahua City road.

Collar bone is broken. No infection yet... the bandages should be changed twice a day.

I know.

Was the steering faulty?

What?

Jack, you're wrong.

Good evening.

That's very kind of somebody. Who do I have to thank?  What happens if I miss the train?

On the Durham Road. The Pantiles.

Fine...  I want to talk to you.

I must go. I'm in a hurry.

Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not.  Why all the bloody needle?

Really?

You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited.

Nasty.

Especially when I play the lead.

What girl?

Expect so.

No.

Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.

No. I'll be off now. I should be at work.

Working at Woolworths.

Yes.

Right.

Good lad.

Oh yes? How?

I'm sorry. Here. This'll pay for a course in karate.

I see.

Very nice.  I'll pay you for tonight as well.

Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ...

Ta-ra.

That little shit!

Pension him off.

What am I supposed to do?  I don't know where they've taken him. Do you?

What's that supposed to mean?

You must be joking. I never eat breakfast,  Did you sleep well?

That's all right, Eric.

Very...  So, who you working for these days Eric?

I've always ad your welfare at heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm nosy.

Yep.

Yeah, I'll do that.  Told you it wouldn't take long, didn't I?

Knock it off, Gerald.

Harry! Jack, I don't want to be rude, but these men have brought a lot of money with them. Glenda, you don't offer a man like Jack a drink in those piddling little glasses.  Give him the bloody bottle.  Now, where are we?

You're bluffing, you bastard!

...Polacks...

I...I don't know.

And now...

You get a bad month, all of a...

All of, they got you on this "board..."

...cower in his boots...

...sales promotion, "You lose, then we fire your..." No.  It's medieval... it's wrong. "Or we're going to fire your ass." It's wrong.

You know who it is.  It's Mitch. And Murray.  'Cause it doesn't have to be this way.

What hard part?

What?

No.

What?

Yes.

Yes.

Talking about it as a...

As a robbery.

No.  Not actually.

You're saying "me."

Is that what I said?

Yes.

What if you don't get caught?

That's none of your fucking business...

Hey, hey, let's just keep it simple, what I need is not the...what do you need...?

Uh-huh.

What do you care...?

Yeah.  That's swell.  Yes.  You're right.  How are you?

Well, they're old.  I saw the shit that they were giving you.

They stole the...

What?

Why?  Because they're stupid. "Where were you last night..."

I was at home, where were you?

Was I?

Where did Moss...?  I...

You understand?

No.

In school.

I didn't...why should I..."Where were you last..." Is anybody listening to me...?  Where's Moss...?  Where...?

Just go to lunch.

Go to lunch, George.

Excuse me...

Will you get out of here.  Will you get out of here.  Will you.  I'm trying to run an office here.  Will you go to lunch?  Go to lunch. Will you go to lunch? 

...did they...

Levene!

I'm talking with Mr. Lingk.  If you please, I'll be back in.  I'll be back in a while...I told you, check with Mr. Williamson.

Hey, fella, let's get this done...

You're done, come down, and let's...

I'm going to the Chinks.  You're done, come down, we're going to smoke a cigarette.

Shelly, you blew the last...

...you didn't close...

...and what is that, John?  What? Bad luck.  That's all it is.  I pray in your life you will never find it runs in streaks.  That's what it does, that's all it's doing. Streaks.  I pray it misses you. That's all I want to say.

You're saying that I'm fucked.

Let me tell you something, Shelly. I do what I'm hired to do. I'm...wait a second.  I'm hired to watch the leads.  I'm given...hold on, I'm given a policy.  My job is to do that.  What I'm told.  That's it.  You, wait a second, anybody falls below a certain mark I'm not permitted to give them the premium leads.

The...Shelly?  The hot leads are assigned according to the board.  During the contest. Period.  Anyone who beats fifty per...

Yes.

...apart from the top men on the contest board.

I can't do it, Shel.

No.  You're right.  That's for later.  We'll talk in a month. What have you got?  I want two sits. Tonight.

That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  I'd like something off the other list.  Which, very least, that I'm entitled to.  If I'm still working here, which for the moment I guess that I am.  What?  I'm sorry I spoke harshly to you.

The deal still stands, our other thing.

All that I'm telling you: that one thing you can tell them it's a remarkable sale.

What does that fucking mean?

Well, hadn't it?

How much did you get for them?  How much did you get for them?

I want to tell you something, Shelly.  You have a big mouth.

You've got a big mouth, and now I'm going to show you an even bigger one. 

No, I think I don't want your money. I think you fucked up my office. And I think you're going away.

Only the beginning...

Forget it.  Frame it.  It's worthless.

You stick around I'll pull the memo for you.  I'm busy now...

Call up the bank.  I called them.

"Bruce, Harriet...Fuck me, believe in yourself..."

Will you shut up, I'm telling you this...

Hey, big fucking deal.  Broke a bad streak...

"You have to believe in yourself... you"--look--"alright...?"

"I want to tell you something, Harriet..."

Bruce..."I don't want to fuck around with you.  I don't want to go round this, and pussyfoot around the thing, you have to look back on this.  I do, too.  I came here to do good for you and me.  For both of us.  Why take an interim position? 

He's right, Williamson.

The hell with him.  We'll go to lunch, the leads won't be up for...

Yes.

Which...

Home cooking...

No, his wife is.

I'm sorry, Jim.  I can't talk now. I'll call you tonight...I'm sorry. I'm coming, Ray. 

Me.

Mm.

I don't know.

To change our minds.

Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.

The check wasn't cashed?

She told me I have to.

What does that mean?

I...

It's nothing.

Not to my knowledge, no...

You going to turn State's?

Harriet and blah blah Nyborg.

Who said "Fuck the Machine"?

Sittin' on top of the world, sittin' on top of the world, everything's fucking peachfuzz...

Did they...

You did?

'Cause I don't have to eat this month.  No.  Okay.  Give 'em to me...  Fucking Mitch and Murray going to shit a br...what am I going to do all...

Mr. Lingk and I are going to...

It was nothing...I was assuring Mr. Lingk...

Just a few days.

I can't.

I was taller than you when I was fourteen.

That's right.

The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;

We have no money for a rug.

Oh yes, the very best.

I got surprises for everybody!

Connie.

Michael...

No.

Relax, Freddie honey.  Come dance with me.

I hate to see you cringe in front of him.  How come you're so scared of your own kid brother?

I'm getting out of here I said; these guys all have guns!

It's not talk; I'm doing it.

Not for strangers; for my country.

I'm a little short.  I've been out of work.  Let me owe you the money for a few weeks.

Get a good night's sleep.  We got a new suit, new shirt, new tie, and I'm going to shave you myself. Tomorrow we want you to look respectable for fifty million of your fellow Americans.

I didn't turn against nobody; he turned against me.

We're making an investment in Havana.

I'd like to come along.  There's been a lot of strain, and I've been cooped up in this room for three days.

It was hard to have him killed.

Sincere.  What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike.

Mike, are you crazy, I'm your brother.

But, you told me yourself...

We have time.

And you believed that story.

Why?

 And he agreed?

Chi?

Okay, just hear me out.  What if Carlo had been paid to help get Sonny killed?  What if his beating of Connie that time was a deliberate plot to get Sonny out into the open? Then what?  And what if the Don, a great man, couldn't bring himself to do what he had to do, avenge his son's death by killing his daughter's husband?  What if that, finally, was too much for him, and he made Michael his successor, knowing that Michael would take that load off his shoulders, would take that guilt?

When is it finally over?  I want it to be over before my baby is born.

The Barretts from Rubicon Bay came by in a new speedboat.  Rocco tried to say she wasn't in, but Kay spotted them and asked if they would take her and the kids for a ride.  That was three hours ago.

I wanted to tell you alone; your wife doesn't know what's going on.

I know.  I went down to the Barrett house.  But she's gone.  They drove her and the kids to North Tahoe airport.

I was in my house.  Willy tried, but it would have taken some strong-arm to stop her, and he figured you wouldn't want that.

But if you're wrong...

A little care he can ride in with an electric motor.

She took the Senate Investigation worse.

Roth engineered it, Michael.  He made Pentangeli think you hit him. Deliberately letting him get off alive.  Then the New York detectives turned Frankie over to the FBI.  My informants say he was half dead and scared stiff -- talking out loud that you had turned on him and tried to kill him.  Anyway, they had him on possession, dealing in heroin, murder one and a lot more. There's no way we can get to him and you've opened yourself to five points of perjury.

His medical condition is reported as... &quot;terminal.&quot;

Why do you hurt me, Michael?  I've always been loyal to you.

He's going to try Panama...

Tom, what do I do now?

Yeah, I still read a lot.  They bring me stuff.

Actually, I've come with good news; the Corleone family has done you a favor.

We know you're a busy man, with plenty of enemies -- we saw the opportunity to do you a favor, and we did.  No strings.

I don't think that's necessary.

Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.

The witness is excused; take him out.

I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone.  We're not to let you through.

Mr. Hagen's, ma'am.

I'm not going to stay long; I can't.

Michael.

At this moment, I feel no love for you at all.  I never thought that could happen, but it has.

You don't come in here, talk to an owner in Las Vegas like that.

Well, we can all have a nice dinner together tonight.  How are your eyes?

You talk about the baby.  She can have another baby.

Not for a few years.

Yes.

The incident of the other night is a nuisance that I can take care of. I came to you because I want nothing to affect our agreement; I wanted to clear everything I'm going to do with you, just in case.

You're a great man, Mr. Roth, I have much to learn from you.

I know that; but who gave the go ahead.

Let him gamble.

Yes.

No.

That is a complete falsehood.

I do not.

You were unfair with them.

Michael, anything.  What is it I can do for you?

Jesus Christ, Michael, then let's hit 'em now, while we still got the muscle.

I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone, because I don't like you; I don't like the kind of man you are.  I despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family.

Sitting right behind you.

Maybe, yes... maybe no.

Like hell!  And who the hell are you to give me orders.  Watch your manners or you'll be on your Sicilian ass in the street there.

Not anymore you don't.  Doll.

Maybe it's supposed to be funny.

Do you realize you're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me?

All the old men I know think about nothing but sex.

Sure you're free, for now at least. But how long before you're just alone?  Pathetic and alone.

I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.

You will not hurt him?

The Master wants to know if you are free for lunch.  I tell him you will be having other plans, but he insists I ask.

A homo?

I'm not going to hurt anyone.

What do I do?

He says here good-bye.  I find it in his room.  He is sorry, he says. He has had a wonderful life.

We have his note.

But how're you going to explain this?  How did you get him out of the pool?

Nice place.

Yeah.  I better get on with my work.

But before I retired, you might say I had a brief time in the sun. Fame, as it were.  Tell me, do you like motion pictures?

This and that.  The only ones you maybe have heard of are the "Frankenstein" pictures.

What was wrong?

What's to sketch?

Just a year.  I dropped out to join the Marines.

You don't say?  Which picture?

All right already.  I'll take it off.  Kind of warm in here anyway.

No.  I'm fine.

I guess you'd say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks.

This David's a friend?

Can't today.

Or a husband.  Depending on which of us you asked.  My friend David. He lived here for many years.

I'm not, you know.

Of course.  I don't want to scare you off.  Not before I'm finished with you.

Not at the moment.

You know how it is.  You have to kiss ass just to get a piece of it.

The world is just one kiss-ass game after another.  A man has to make up his own life, alone.

What happened?

I told you.  I don't like to talk about that.

Clayton is fine.

David produced her last picture.

Ten minutes ago.  Didn't you hear me calling?

No.  Definitely not.

You don't have any baggy shorts? Pajama bottoms?

I thought you'd given up on my picture.

"A perfect night for mystery and horror.  The air itself is filled with monsters."

Please, Clayton.  Just for a minute.  Long enough for me to see the effect.

What was that?

Relax, Clayton.  I can't hear you. I can't hear a word.

Oh, but you feel good, Clayton.

Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York.

Yes, yes, Dr. Payne.  But from the neck up?  What's my story there?

Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Growing old.

Oh dear.

Good-bye.  So nice to see you...

Go.

No.  I expect you can't.

One likes to live simply.

Nice.  And your lighting and camera angles.  You're got to go back to German silent movies to find anything like it.

Oh no, I want to hear everything. You made twenty pictures in all --

But it's the horror movies you'll be remembered for.

It is, isn't it?  My life as a game of strip poker.  Shall we play?

Take off your vest and I'll tell you a story.

I guess.

I just need to -- lie down. Studio.  Daybed in studio.

Head.  Not heart.

I interviewed him after I met you. I'm his social secretary now. Well, assistant to his secretary.

Don't go away.

Fine.  Quite fine.  And Your Royal Highness?

About your brother. And the deeeep shit he's in --

Maybe she don't know. Although I don't see how that could be. Maybe she didn't want to upset you -

Jesus ...

And they still have the lowest rate of cancer of anywhere in the world. You know why? All they eat is seafood.

I do a poaching number. Six-ounce fillets in a saucepan of brine. In 8 minutes, I could cater a goddamn wedding. Plain but flavorful. And it's a good way to show off my Hollandaise sauce ...

Me, too. Every time I walk...

Point-five ...

I don't want him hurt...

I could kill you. That occurred to me. When I first heard about this. That I would kill you ...

I knew you'd say that.

I hope you know what you're doing. God help you if you don't ...

This is number 50. We did it. It's over Where's the money ?

But I had to. It was the only way to get to you --

How is he?

You know my back -

I don't think so, Detective ...

Honestly? I want to - once every few months - get into my car. Pack a lunch. And drive on up to Chino. On visiting day. Bring you some magazines. Maybe some almond clusters. And see you all bright and shiny in your orange jumpsuit. That's what I want ...

Castlebeck.

Cadillac.

The other day....

No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I heard we got Shaquille ...

Not at all ...

You'll get the hang of it, kid. You just need to remember one thing -

That's an after-market alarm. Can't just cut her wires ...

Donny-nothin'!

Hey, Donny --

Hell, yeah. Mirror Man here is our electronics expert. He's got some gadgets you old farts maybe never -heard of; Tumbler can drive anything with wheels, and some things without; Toby's a hacker, can do things with a computer, that are pretty amazing ...

Gray.

Jonathan Quayle Higgins ...

Okay, okay. The important thing to remember, is to Think Slow. Take your time. It may not seem like it, but the night is long. Long enough. Just think slow and think smart...

That's being obscurest ... Who else? Better known. Memphis?

That's a good one, Donny...

He didn't mess up. There it is ...

It ain't what you'd call a "good sign"

Atley Jackson came to see me ...

I knew it. He's changed, Randall. He's a different boy. He's lost that... That sweetness ... It's gone ... And I don't know what to do ...

Every day. I wonder about that every day...

I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.

"Carol." A 198 Mercedes ... She lives in the suburbs ...

What do you say, Toby?,

How'd you get here? Your Moms give you ride -- ?

I dunno ...

What do you got ... ?

About what?

I can handle it --

Me.

I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...

I hear ya. Get me outta this. I'll move to the country. Open a fruit stand...

It's for assholes. The Legal Buck blows, Memphis.  You know that. Doing this, we make mad bank, my boys are down, the girlies come around and the boosts are a breeze. Yeah, sure, you're gonna get jacked-up every now and then - but ain't that a small price to pay for never, never-ever, having to say "paper or plastic?"

Nah.

I know. I've missed you, too

I know ...

Shocking, huh? We're clear now. It's done. I've never actually paid for a car. I want to see what it feels like

That what you want?

No ...

Oh. Okay. Right.

No. Open her ...

A little trick I picked up at the Car Thief Retirement Home ...

Deodorant.

Woo-woo-wooooo!

Of course you are. You're a professional...

No worries ...

I dunno. I know a place.

Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.

Nothing. Just that if I was less secure, I might think you were more into Eleanor than you are me...

What's that?

The chop-shop... Where are the stripped cars?  The rolled-back odometers? The part bins?

He's gotten involved --

The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -

His criminal career has officially come to a close ...

She left...

Sure. Hey, Toby. You grew up

You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto abreast of our progress ...

No ... No... No ... Tell me what's gonna happen? Kip? Tell me. What's gonna happen?

Checkin' it out

Shit all looks the same here --

Look at Jeannie's kid.

The oldest one.  He was in an argument. A lousy ten-dollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he's been arrested. She has a heart attack.  She drops dead right on the spot. Now Jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.

No. Come on. It was the younger one that was the bad one.

Listen to him.  "Watch the suit," he says.  A little pisser I've known all my life.  Hey, Tommy, don't go get too big.

Wha?  Me?

Me? Why would I get into that shit?

I've been all fucked up since I got out.

I'm in construction.

The truth was, that no matter how bad I felt, I was still very attracted to him. Why should I give him up to someone else? Why should she win?

Shit.

What are you talking about?

Let her carry this shit inside.

I don't want to hear about her anymore.

She's beautiful.  Look at her. Henry, look at her.

What did he say, exactly?

Safe? Here? They'll kill me here. They're all afraid I'm gonna rat them out. People are already looking to walk away from me. I'm dead in here. You gotta get me out.

Just get me out.

I got seared.

I got scared.

Jimmy was one of the most feared gays in the city.  He was first locked up at eleven and was doing hits for mob bosses when he was sixteen. Hits never bothered him. It was business. But what he really loved to do was steal.  I mean, he actually enjoyed it.  Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in the movies.  He was one of the city's biggest hijackers. Clothes. Razor blades. Booze. Cigarettes. Shrimp and lobsters. Shrimp and lobsters were the best. They went fast.

Jimmy.

I gotta talk to you.

Nah.

Yeah.

Will you stop.

You're some fucking jerk.

What for? I got a pound of stuff in my jacket I've been carrying around all day. We gotta start taping it to your leg.

I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.

Tommy  ...

No, no. It's okay.

Nothing. I dropped the soap. That's all.

He's okay. They sobered him up.

Don't bring that up. You're the one who wanted us here.

Please?

That fuckin' guinea, Will knows him.

I don't know yet.

Next week.

Probation, counselin', few days a week.

What do I want a way outta here for? I want to live here the rest of my life. I want to be your next door neighbor. I want to take out kids to little league together up Foley Field.

Yeah, I figured now that you got your big job over in Cambridge, you needed some way to get over there and I knew I wasn't gonna drive you every day...

This is your house, right?

You could put a pool in that backyard.

Yah, all right...

NO SHE DIDN'T GET YOUR DOUBLE BURGER!! IT'S ALL FUCKIN' FLYIN' FISH FILET!!

Yah, that was different. Management was restructurin'--

So in the morning, there's a knock on the door it's the Statie. So my Uncle's like, "Is there a problem?" And the Statie's like "I pulled you over and you took off." And my Uncle's like "I never seen you before in my life, I been home all night with my kids." And Statie's like "Let me get in your garage!" So he's like "All right, fine." He takes around the garage and opens the door --and the Statie's cruiser is in my Uncle's garage.

The fuckin' Trooper was so embarrassed he didn't do anything. The fuckin' guy had been drivin' around in my Uncle's car all night lookin' for the house.

Save it for your mother, funny guy. We heard it before.

Allegedly, what I am saying is your situation will be concurrently improved if I had two hundred sheets in my pocket right now.

I have about seventy-three...

Good, it was all right.

Hey, I'm the last guy to want to talk about school at the bar. But as long as you're here I want to "seize" the opportunity to ask you a question.

There's no problem. I was just hoping you could give me some insight into the evolution of the market economy in the early colonies. My contention is that prior to the Revolutionary War the economic modalities especially of the southern colonies could most aptly be characterized as agrarian pre- capitalist and...

Somethin's in my room.

The limit is not found!  The limit is not found.

Yeah, can I help you?

Well, he didn't show up for work today...

Now, it won't be as bad as it sounds, Will.  I've already spoken to one therapist, his name is Henry Lipkin and he's a friend of mine. He's also published four books and is widely considered to be one of the brightest men in his field.  I'm sure it'll be better than spending the next six months in jail.

Yeah, when do I get my hypnosis? You guys been talkin' for twenty minutes.

I'll cancel every meeting right now. I'll give you a job myself. I just wanted you to see what was out there.

I just want you to know...It's been a pleasure.

I appreciate that.

Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call.

I did.

Since Nancy died.

I need someone with your kind of background.

You're from the same neighborhood. South Boston.

Just meet with the boy once a week.

That would be fine.

I won't talk first.

Not at all.

I been here a couple years.

Who?

I do.

Look, I don't know what else I can say. I'm not sitting at home every night, twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy's life. But it's important to start early. I was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty-three years to do something worthy of a Field's medal.

I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here!

"Undermine?"

--And why does he hang out with his friends? Because any one of those kids would come in here and take a bat to your head if he asked them to. It's called loyalty!

--I'm not angry at you--

I don't blame you! It's not about that! It's about the boy! 'Cause he's a good kid! And I won't see this happen to him-- I won't see you make him feel like a failure too!

He's not you!

There is somebody...

I don't got a crush on her.

Yeah, Morgan. It's a real rarity that we'd be out drinkin'.

Had one, now I'm fucked again.

--you have a quality-- something you were born with, that you have no control over- and you are, in a sense, hiding that by becoming a janitor. And I'm not saying that's wrong. I'm friends with the janitor that works in my building. He's been to my house for dinner. As a matter of fact I did some free consultation for "Mike" -- that's not his real name. That's in my book.

Will, your not getting off that easy.

What places?

Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?

If you wanna hit "Ramrod," take your shot. Take some pride in it. You go to church? So fuckin' what, God loves you. I mean, Christ. A guy as well known as you? By the time you put your disguise on and skulk out of the house Sunday nights you probably look like "Inspector Cluseau."

What did you think?

I did.

No.

This is a real piece of shit.

The color here, see how dark it is? It's interesting.

--Well, maybe that means you.

You ever think about gettin' remarried?

You're kiddin' me.

Well hell, I didn't know Pudge was gonna hit the home run.

I don't know.

Oh, what? You're going to take the professor's side on this?

I didn't want the job.

I didn't ask for this.

You're not going to fail me are you?

Cause fuck him, that's why.

It's not your fault.

I'm gonna travel a little bit, so I don't know where I'll be.

Okay, you got me. It's the ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser who got drunk and wouldn't leave you alone all night.

Yeah, I figured maybe sometime this week we could go to a cafe and have some caramels.

You know, nothing special.

Your house must have been a zoo.

Sorry. I'm sorry. Give me another crack at it. Let me take you out.

No.

I'd say...  It's only four in the mornin', they're prob'ly up.

Rich? I have an inheritance. It's two handred and fifty thousand dollars. That's exactly what it'll cost me, minus about five hundred bucks, to go all the way through med school. This is what I'm doing with that money. I could have done anything I wanted. I could have expanded my wardrobe, substantially.

I guess. I don't know. How do you remember your phone number?

I guess so.

--But you can do my O-chem lab in under an hour, you can--

How do you know that?

Yeah, but how do you know?

And you're sure about that?

'Cause that's a serious thing you're sayin'. I mean, we might be in California next week and you could find out somethin' about me that you don't like. And you might feel like "hey this is a big mistake."  But you can't take it back, 'cause you know it's real serious and you can't take somethin' like that back. Now I'm in California, 'cause you asked me to come. But you don't really want me there. And I'm stuck in California with someone who really doesn't want me there and just wishes they had a take-back.

--some prick from Stanford that your parents will approve of. Then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too.

At least you have a mother.

I never knowed they was anything like her!

Sure! I was just aimin' to meet up with a couple girls I know.

But ain't no reason--

I never had my house pushed over before. I never had my fambly stuck out on the road. I never had to lose... ever'thing I had in life.

Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?

Look at that ol' coffeepot steam!

You're *ticklin' me!*

People done it. If they could, we could.

Four.

Okay, mister. Whatcha payin'?

Riot? I don't see no riot. Who're you?

Well, I don't know what you gonna do about it, because I don't hear no riot an' I don't see no riot, an' what's more I don't believe they *is* no riot.  Look for yourself.

I can't hardly believe it. Camp I was in once, they burned it out--the deputies an' some of them poolroom fellas.

Goodnight.

Ought to be. That's fact'ry liquor. Cost me a buck.

I'll be glad to see you pa. Last time I seen him was at a baptizin', an' he had one a the bigges' doses of the Holy Sperit I ever seen. He go to jumpin' over bushes, howlin' like a dog-wolf in moon-time. Fin'ly he picks hisself out a bush big as a piana an' he let out a squawk an' took a run at that bush. Well, sir, he cleared her but he bust his leg snap in two. They was a travellin' dentist there and he set her, an' I give her a prayin' over, but they wasn't no more Holy Sperit in your pa after that.

If she does it'll be a miracle outa Scripture.

Thought you was in jail.

I aim to.

We was outa food. Tonight we had meat. Not much, but we had it. Think Pa's gonna give up his meat on account a other fellas? An' Rosasharn needs milk. Think Ma's gonna starve that baby jus' cause a bunch a fellas is yellin' outside a gate?

No, my old man got a place, forty acres. He's a sharecropper, but we been there a long time.

Naw--not much!

That's where I get off.

You been acrost?

This here's a strike.

You want to get ast to eat, hunh?

Didn' none of these have no breakfast?

I ain't talkin' about you, I'm talkin' about me. And I'm a-stayin'. I give her a good goin' over all night long-- and I'm a-stayin'.

All but me! I'm a-stayin'.

California.

Thought I'd take a walk. Any law against it?

Maybe that's jus' what he done.

This got a floor. Wouldn't leak when it rains.

It sure is hell jus' tryin' to get enough to eat.

Don't matter. Just got to go--an' keep a-goin', till we get plenty a distance away from here.

She'll be awright.

No, Ma. I'm paroled. I got my papers.

Sometimes they do somethin' to you, Tommy. They hurt you--and you get mad--and then you get mean--and they hurt you again--and you get meaner, and meaner--till you ain't no boy or no man any more, but just a walkin' chunk a mean-mad. Did they hurt you like that, Tommy?

No.

Tom--you tol' me--you promised you wasn't like that. You promised me.

Busted my cheek but I can still see. What'd you hear?

I'm sorry, Ma. But--I didn't know what I was doin', no more'n when you take a breath. I didn't even know I was gonna do it.

I'm gonna go away tonight. I can't go puttin' this on you folks.

Don't know--but it's better'n this.

I could hide you, Tommy.

Tommy, they'll drive you, an' cut you down like they done to Casy.

I know, ma'am... on'y it's for a ole lady, no teeth, gotta sof'n it with water so she can chew it, an' she's hongry.

I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.

That's what I asked you, ain't it?

Can't tie him. Either we'll hurt him or he'll git so mad he'll hurt his self.  Reckon we could git him *drunk*?

I shore would like to stop here a while an' give her some res' but we on'y got 'bout forty dollars left. I won't feel right till we're there an' all workin' an' a little money comin' in.

Me an' you both.

I ain't got nothin' in *my* han'.

Lissen. You done busted it. You hear?  But lissen here. I won't tell nobody, y'understan'?

Now don't you go monk'ing--

Yes I do.

In the corporate offices.

Whatever I can get away with.

Really...? So what?

Really?

Insane.

Not much else.

Where have I been?

No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?

Okay... Hold on...

I think they'll probably have booze there.

What?

Okay... Would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week?

Like heroin?

Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm....

Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath!

I'm staying here.

They'll have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs.... made themselves a part of something. And they can talk about what they do. What am I going to say?  "I killed the President of Paraguay with a fork."

Why not. I trust you. You couldn't turn me in because of Doctor-Patient privilege... and I don't want to be "withholding"... and I know where you live.

What stuff?

If I get antsy I'll kill a few small animals.

I work alone.

I'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts.

No harm no foul.

Hard to get good help these days.

I didn't get into this business to have "associates." And I don't want to join your Goddamned union. "Loner-- " "Loner gunman." Get it? "On my own." That's the whole point. Why don't you become a cop, or something. You can drink coffee in the morning... with friends!

Nope.

I guess.

Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded killer.

-Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and then you come in and kill the Bad Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.

He using her.

It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?

All of it?

I'm not happy.

Tell them my house exploded.

I spoke to your father the other day.

Same thing that happened to you-- I stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team. I joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul.

To shoot you. Correct.

I visualized you, in a haze, as one of the slackster, flannel-wearing, coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been seeing in Newsweek.

Oh, you know me, Martin. I'm the same old sell-out baby-boomer, exploiting the oppressed I got shot for at Kent State. But why don't we have a drink and forget the whole thing?

That's good.

Yeah. Hello. This is Tom Booker. I got a message you called.

Ma'am, I'm very sorry about your problems and I appreciate what your daughter must be going through, but I'm afraid you've misunderstood whatever it is you read. I don't do that sort of thing.

Mr. Booker, if I could just ex --

All by yourself?

You ever just stand still for a minute?

What's that to miss?

A jogger, huh?

You sleeping all right in that house?

I thought you were an editor, not a reporter?

He'd be grateful, he'd take real good care with you.

Feel good?

She was never really happy here. She did the best she could.

Tom.

What?!

I don't care! We'd be together.

I can't do this. I can't leave you...

I don't care.

I didn't know I had to.

I don't care.

You were never thirteen, Mom.

Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something!

You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it!

Hi.

You already did.

Why? There's no food in the house?

You... not wanting to go home because you hate daddy so much.

I can't remember the last time you made him dinner.

FOR YOU! Because I'm your daughter which means you're the best mother! Isn't that what you're always talking about in interviews -- having it all, the great career, the great family... Proving everybody wrong. Wanting everybody to think you're this perfect woman!

LEAVE ME ALONE!!

Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me?

Who's there?

All right. Speak to you then.

Nothing new. He's just going off duty.

Okay.

Oh. Right. I'll call him.

Yeah.

Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. And she can't sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her.

He'll be sedated. I know horses, Robert. I'm the one who taught Grace how to ride.

I don't care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will.

No, that's not what I said. I'm not a dictator. If you feel you should come, then come. Just do whatever you think is right.

Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.

Okay.

I know. We miss you too.

Night.

Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.

Everything all right.

About what?

Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?

No. He had the choice.

Oh, you can just set up on the dining table. I have to rearrange my shelves tomorrow.

Oh, it's... I wanted to tell you that, if you'd like, you being so busy, I could take Grace to her therapy exercises for you. I have to go in once a week for shopping anyway.

Promise?

You too, Diane.

Oh hell, I don't know... According to Tom, she's a pretty determined woman. Must've thought it was worth it.

What?

Diane!

What, they ain't going forty miles into Choteau everytime they want a hamburger.

Well, that's just what we need on a cattle ranch -- a vegetarian from New York.

No thanks.

Weekend after next...

You know her?

Yeah.

We should be fine, then.

And next time, Miss Annie, you can run down the calves...

I don't know... You sure Tom said it's all right?

You know, you're a good kid.

Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.

She's an editor.

What does that mean?

Why don't we just cut through the woods?

No, not yet.

YA JUST HAD A TURN. IT WAS NOT.

You're the one who's stupid -- letting her go and fall off your horse!!

I haven't been back in over twenty years, but I wouldn't be surprised. The population's larger.

Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.

How long were you married?

Sometimes.

Where did you learn all this stuff?

About horses? I'd love to learn more about it myself. Do you offer any private lessons for riders?

It looks good, sir. We've got an uncorrupted hard drive.

Alright sir.

Dragon book. Compiler design.

The Red Book. NSA Trusted Networks. Otherwise known as the Ugly Red Book that won't fit on a shelf.

Again?  Yeah sure.

Look at this, it's so lean and clean.

Yo, everyone check this out. Hey, what's the Da Vinci virus?

Yeah. Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.

Difficulty rating?

Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our date.

Hmmm.

And unpack.

Never heard of you. Done anything?

Pool on the roof must have a leak.

I said give me time.

Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?"

Are you challenging me?

If I win, you become my slave.

You're not gonna win.

Yo, chill man, I'm talking to Venezuela.

Sorry, I can't help you, okay?

Must have been hell, huh? Zero Cool?  A virus has been planted in the Ellingson Mineral computer system. You were our prime suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it.

Cancer?

My name is the Plague.

As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?

I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.

Joey, Joey...

I copied it from Ellingson, okay? They're asking me about it, alright? Will you take a look for me?

Someone didn't bother reading my carefully prepared memo on commonly used passwords. Now, as I so meticulously pointed out, the for most used passwords are love,  sex, secret and...  ...God. So would your holiness care to change her password?

Virus?

Well luckily, you have a gifted and talented security officer. I traced the hacker's call. The secret service picked him up this morning. I'll just search his files for the original virus code, and then I can eliminate it.

Sh, sh sh sh sh.

Nothing, it's just a minor glitch.

Hello, operator? I'm having trouble dialing a number.

A patient pickup and transfer to Smith's Grove.

All right.

Jamie needs a Halloween costume.

You don't owe me anything.

Not without Jamie.

No. You son of a bitch!

Go!

Mom, I'm on a diet. You want an oinker for a daughter?

I know, and next to that is the police, hospital, fire, and probably National Guard.

How do you know their not?

I'm not calling the fire department.

For Christ sakes. Spare me the speech. I've listened to it for a decade.  The fact is that Michael Myers was a federal patient, and a federal prisoner therefore he is subject to federal law.

How many people in the bus?

Sure ain't. Martians could land on Ben's doorstep, all he'd do is spit once and get himself a shot gun.

Police station. I ain't closing down with out a good goddamn reason.

Looks to me like your out of business. Now I want some answers.

Al here lost his boy 10 years back.

Like a sister?

Like a real sister?

I know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long.

But I thought you didn't want to go trick-or-treating.

He's coming to get me Rachel.

Coming.

I'm ready. I'm ready. Okay, let's go.

This is great Rachel. Come on.

Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.

Why?

All right.

I don't know.

Jamie?

He's here, Sheriff.

It isn't a man.

Let it be Earl. Let the police handle it.

Car trouble?

All right Rachel, you stay by this radio. The state boys will send word once their in route. When that word comes you go tell deputy Logan.

Now you understand?

I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.

I don't know yet. I have to get out of taking my stupid brother trick-or- treating.

That man who drove by so fast, the one you yelled at.

The guys think I'm too smart.

Okay. Bye.

Of course.

I doubt that. Listen, my mother is letting me use her car. I'll pick you up. 6:30.

I wasn't spooked.

I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.

Annie!

He went out drinking beer with Mike Godfrey and he won't be back until late. YOU'LL have to call him tomorrow. Besides, I'm on my way to pick up Paul.

He was. Old jerko found a way to sneak out. Listen, I'll call you in an hour or so.

Here, Lester.

Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?

Okay. First I rip your clothes off...

Are you sure?

Will you call me tomorrow?

Promise?

More fancy talk... You want to know what Haddonfield is? Families. Children, all lined up in rows, up and down these streets. You're telling me they're lined up for a slaughterhouse.

I'll stay out with you tonight, Doctor, just on the chance that you're right. And if you are right, damn you for letting him out.

As usual, I don't have anything to do.

Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.

Sure.

Lonnie Elam probably won't get out of the sixth grade.

See you.

Laurie, what's the Boogey Man?

There is no such thing.

It's the bogyman, isn't it?

I killed him...

Hi, Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?

Well, go tell her it's me, okay?

The only thin that ever bothers me is their jibberish. When they start raving on and on...

He said something else. "It's all right now. He's gone. The evil's gone."

You want to see some?

Well, let's do it.

Look at this.

No, really, we mustn't get discouraged.

Oh, in this we're a big hit. Yesterday I auditioned for Come Back Little Sheba.  That, I wasn't such a big hit.

He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.

Look, it's just an evening at the opera.  Did I, I-I do wrong in accepting?

Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk about this at home.  I think it's a matter for your analyst...and mine.

What time do you get off?

Yes.

And it ruins everything else.

Well...

Right.  Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it?

...and, uh, he complained of chest pains.

Let's take a look.

When did you first notice this?

Yes, now-now that you mention it, uh, I-I-I have, uh, buzzing and also ringing.  Ringing and buzzing. Um, am I going deaf, or something?

Hi.

Yeah?

Could you--

Oh, Elliot!

What are you doing here?

You're out looking here?

Oh, I was just going to my AA meeting. ELLIOT Oh, my goodness.  Well, why do you still go to those?  You never tough alcohol.

Oh.  You must have been, uh, very unhappy.

Yes, it's-it's wonderful.

No, I don't have time.

You seem tense.  Is everything all right?  You feel okay?

Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.

Uh, uh, this is great.  I mean, I love e.e. cummings, but I can't let you get this.

Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime.  Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on.

And, uh, d-don't forget the poem on page a hundred and twelve.  It reminded me of you.

Oh, you know...I talked to Hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend.

What are you doing?!

I, I must apologize.  I-I'm, I-I'm sorry.  I'm so mixed up.

Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close.  She'd tell me such a thing.

Why?

I almost didn't.

I promised myself I wouldn't let this happen till you were living alone.  I was so torn when you called.

I know it isn't.

Oh, all the time.

Yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you.  I-I-I want to do things for you.  Hannah doesn't need me as much.  I'm being presumptuous.  Not that you need me.

Yeah.  Uh, well, sure we did.  An- an-and in a way you led me on, because I truly believed you were unhappy with Hannah.  Otherwise, I would never have let myself be drawn in.  I was very weak.  So were you.  Now I've met someone else.

Ah, it's over!  Elliot, I mean it. It's over!

Have you tried these?  These are wonderful.  Holly and her friend made them.

I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk.  I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.

Was I?

Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.

Yeah.

But Catholicism?  Why not your own people?

Lee...  you are the only person I can be with...who I really look forward to being with. 

Mmm...

They're in the basement.

Because I have to!

No.

No--

Yeah?

Ron...Ronny, you know you do have to go on in twenty-five minutes.

Hello?

Can I tell you something?  Can I tell you a secret?

Okay.

Oh, Hannah, she's-she's just embarrassed in front of you, that's all.

I got two minutes.

Oh, you know what?  I'm trying to convince him to produce a play.

H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...

...so I, so I like that.  I always like an underconfident person...

That's a beauty!

Could you have ruined yourself somehow?

Right.  We felt that if we were gonna do it, that we would like somebody who we knew and who we liked and who was warm and bright and...

True.

Yeah.

Will you just tell me one thing?

Uh-oh.

Yeah.

She really does, though.

Oh!

I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I--

Yeah, although it's put an end to the Stanislavski Catering Company. Which is why I have to speak to you. And...  you're gonna get impatient, but...I have to borrow some more money. 

But what I decided to do is some writing.  Yeah, I think I've had it with acting.  You know, these meaningless auditions at cattle calls.  And I can't handle another rejection.  Now let's face it here.  I gotta, you know, latch on to something in my life.  You know--something with a future.  I'm not sixteen anymore.  It's just...crazy!  I've got...an idea for a story. More than one.  And I just need a few months, you know, or, uh, a year even.

Hmm!

Uh, losers!  All losers!

No, not "Oh, so loosely"!  Real specifically!  Is that how you see us?

You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something.  You think I'm too self-sufficient?

Yeah, we're having some problems, but problems that are my business...which I don't see how you could know about in such detail. How does Lee know about these things?  How?  They're private!

Jesus...  I'm glad Hannah got us together. You know, she's got a great instinct for people.  Really.

I remember you.

We didn't hit it off.

...in a really horrible way.

Yeah, and for yours.  I'm sure you've changed.

Probably not.

Yeah.

Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.

I've done no television whatsoever. No.

Oh.  Oh.

I'm-- Yes.  Yes, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  How are you?

What...what about your script?  So what's it about?

You have to remember, we-we-we didn't agree on one thing.

...but who cares?  It was just--  It was fabulous.

I-I would love to talk to you about, uh, that script.  I-I, you know, I think maybe that we could do something with it.

Oh, who cares?

Oh, yeah?  What?

Sure.  Sure, uh, yes.

Okay.

Mmm, what?

I need an antihistamine.  Mom thinks she's feeling her asthma, and so...

God.

Get a garter belt...  Get a garter belt and flirt.

Yeah, okay, right.  Forget it.  What's to eat?

Take our literature...

Then why did you chose to <u>inform</u> me of it...?

Or, perhaps...

He said, and these were his words, he <u>valued</u> our time together, because I was civil.

He told me, he preferred to Eat the Rude. Or:  "natural composting."  Do you think he'd come after <u>you</u>...?

Waal, because your <u>selling</u>'em... Two years ago, his annotated Dictionary of Cuisine, by Alexander Dumas, went for sixteen thousand dollars. Seller's affidavit of ownership, signed Cary Panz.  P.A.N.Z.  Sounds to me like an Orderly.  Whadja clear on the book? Ten, twelve grand?

Say it in English.

...they did it for a lark.

Mason Verger.  For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.  Can <u>you</u> be free....?

Oh, yes.  He's found Peace.

...the whole world's out to get you...

~Don't shoot, G-Men..."

All Quiet Along the Potomac...

They got that kind of money?

Yes, but we know who it was, and I will tell you, Agent Starling, what you know to be true.  I offered the bounty.  It was illegal, and, worse, it was <u>wrong</u>. And I thank God every day that I did not compound my sinful life by the stain of a murder.  Do you  Agent Starling:  do you know <u>God</u>? 

Waal, Nobody's <u>Perfect</u>... What do we hear from our songbird in Switzerland?

Follow Starling, stake out Starling. Increase the pressure on Starling.  He will come to her.

I've never heard that he...

Try Barney Clark.

He was the orderly, during Dr. Lechter's stay in Prison.

...young boys, still...?

Mmm...

Come on, Doctor, <u>then</u> you can sleep...

For a consideration.

...what's he got against you?

Well, then--I wouldn't want to be taken for a <u>hobbyist</u>...

We have a memo here, from your friend Mr. Krendler at the Justice Department.

Well, you know, that happens, on the street.

She was there, alone, sir, she was in a burning building, waiting for your folks to come through the wall.  And...

You nervous...?

You looked oddly at me, back on the landing.

Well, if you will excuse me.  Madame. What a pleasure.

No. 

We got KittyKat...

...and Shirly, let me sleep with her sometime.

They <u>will</u>, sir.  We <u>train</u> them, to the figurine, <u>eventually</u>, they consume a man, say, 80 kilos, say, in...

Is it necessary to know?

I'm opposed to being part, Your Rainbow Coalition.  Evelda Drumgo?  I could of took her down in a snap of the <u>fingers</u>-- <u>But</u>-- I'm out there, and my Rules of Engagement...

...get outta my way, you sonofa<u>bitch</u>...

You put my friend in the ground, with your mickeymouse <u>TaskForce</u>...  Izsat the kind of Headlines that Preserve and Promote, you, sir?

Thanks to <u>you</u>...

And how did he do that?

Would that add to your <u>mirth</u>?

And what would be of Greater Help, than to release her, from the bonds of this sordid earthly existence.  DON'T YOU THINK?  IN WHICH THE INNOCENT ARE TORTURED IN WAYS WHICH WOULD MAKE THE ANGUISH OF THE DAMNED SEEM TAME AND UNIMAGINATIVE, DON'T YOU <u>THINK</u>?  BLIND HIM AGAIN, AND PREPARE <u>HIM AND HER</u> FOR THE PIGS! 

I want the <u>same</u> drink.  Cause it did me <u>good</u>... but I already drunk it, so, barring that, yes, I would like another.

Well.  <u>Excellent</u>... I'm...

No, that is code-word material, that's what <u>that</u> is....

That's what I should do.  Tell me why?

You're going to <u>do</u> that?

The Multi-Jurisdiction Task Force:  read alphabet soup, for the continued pursuit, and in preparation for the apprehension of the fugitive, Evelda Drumgo.  The man's hazing you.

I'll tell you what:  I should go in there, volunteer to fill up his Female Quota. 

Saying what, "Look out for a guy with ten fingers...?"

Y'want to gimme Brigham's pistol?

Why?

They aren't expensive, you got them through your connections.... speaking of which:

We are here on sufferance.  I am here...

Because it is exclusive... because <u>everyone</u> will be here...

Oh, my <u>program</u>...

What shape is the scar?

Well, that's you see, what I am, kind and feeling.

...a case, so, so <u>fascinating</u>, so...

"A liaison position with the Opera." 

...yes, yes, yes....

No.  That's right.  That's all part of it.

I don't <u>think</u> so.

I don't know.  Do <u>you</u> know...?

Yes, so you said.  But what does that mean:  to go beyond The Institution.

Yes.

...why?

That's when you went to the Orphanage...

<u>Someone</u> offered three million dollars bounty on Dr. Lechter's head. 

Yeah...Are we going to do it or what? I still haven't packed.

That's it, Adam, pretend it's one of those arcade things, the tighter you squeeze, the more of a man you are...Ooh, that's it.

Andrew. You're not gay; you're ten. You shouldn't even be having thoughts like...

Well, uh...Promise me you won't do anything until you're 18.

You have no idea. Now run away.

Was there a night that I got really drunk and declared that I never loved anyone as much as I loved you?

Oh thanks, it was nothing...

Why am I so--That's new--The way I figure it is if I can get through to just one camper...then I'm a pretty incompetent counselor.                                           ] Don't get caught. I'll deny                                 ] everything.                                                 ]

You're all making me blush...

That wants to be a Yes.

Yeah, an insane female gynecologist! Hayley, don't listen to her.

I just don't know about this whole actual sexuality thing--How do you go from being friends with a guy to wanting to put the thing he uses to go to the bathroom with in your mouth?

When did pretending to be bored become a sign of superiority?  Are you mad at me for giving the cabin new haircuts or are you just still miserably pining for Wichita's lightning rod?

I didn't realize I had to declare a major.

Ooh look, time to confiscate my first water balloon...

Talia, you know how important our friendship is to me and I would never do anything to...

I-unno...Don't worry, I had everything on the hand memorized.

Talking while kissing.

Iunno.

I should leave. You probably need your rest.

Shut the fuck--!

I'm just thinking I'm glad I broke up with everyone I ever went out with.  The swelling is gonna go down, right?

That's okay. Your Mom said you had a big date. Heck, I'd probably skip my own birthday party for a date.

Shoot.

Ronnie!

Phil Collins? Are you sure he isn't drinking and driving?

Hey really, I don't feel so great.

In my heart, Heather's still alive.

All right.

Color me educated. I learned high school happiness is for members only, Pauline Fleming wouldn't know reality if it lived in her uterus, and reality's name's Heather James. Also, J.D.'s a major creep.

I just want to show different kinds of people can get together and it doesn't have to be Vietnam. You don't get treated badly here do you?

Shut up, it is. I told Dennis if he gave me another topic that was political, I'd spew burrito chunks.

Geez, don't listen to them.

What are you doing here?!

Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus...

Yeah, maybe.

Yes. Yes. We'll work something out. I swear to God. Won't we J.D.?...J.D.?

Uh-huh.

Sure.

How very.

Really? That thing in the caf today was pretty severe.

Time out....Jason Dean. Your Pop's Fred Dean Construction. Must be rough. Moving place to place.

Then let's just concoct ourselves a little hangover cure that'll induce her to spew red, white, and blue.

Don't be a dick. That stuff'll kill her.

No shit, sherlock. I can't believe it. I just killed my best friend.

Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.

"To me though, suicide is the natural answer to the myriad of problems life has given me."

"I die knowing no one knew the real me."

Get crucial. We won't be using blanks this time.

Oh.

Remember he's left-handed.

Of course.

I did not want them <u>dead</u>.

Sure. Can we make an ice run before the funeral?

Wha-at? Come on, there's another T.V. in the kitchen. You know you used to have a sense of humor.

Like father, like son. A serious-as- fuck bomb in the boiler room that'll set off a pack of thermals upstairs. Okay, so let's start by slowly putting the bomb down on the ground.

You want to wipe the slate clean as much as I do. Okay, so maybe I am killing everyone in the school because nobody loves me. You have a purpose though! Remember? Let's face it, the only place different social types can genuinely get along with each other is in heaven.

Goddamn Geek!

Shut the fuck up, all right.

Heather was cool, but cruel. The good looks and bad manners gave her power, but it could not give her happiness.

Get a job.

Stained with loserness. Oh, I like it. Can I use that. It'd be dynamite on interoffice memoranda.

sighs as HONORA puts the frying pan on the stove.

sits down next to Honora, glass of sherry in hand.

Is it hurting, dear?

pulls his coat on. HONORA gives him a peck cheek.

leads a young man-JOHN-into the dining room.

I just want to be on my own for a while.

You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!

But she'll have no one to look after her!

I care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education.

You're failing English . . . you used to be top of the class- PAULINE I'm doing my own writing!

Oh, no . . . Mummy's awfully good at it.

Oh! I'll pop them in a bowl.

I'm not! I'm going to the Fourth World! It's like Heaven, only better because there aren't any Christians.

That . . .

It's so beautiful!

Well . . . no. But it's so obvious.

Hurry up! I'm freezing!

They'll blame the bloody housekeeper. She nicks stuff all the times!

I can try my father's safe. I'm sure I can get the keys to his office.

Let's go for a walk down here . . . come on, Mummy!

Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like it's going through a meat grinder. I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or...

Your insight is enlightening.

Easy there Trevor. You need to relax.

Some call it resilience. Others, stupidity.

Okay so... what's the safest place?

You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.

What was it?

Look never mind. Just get some numbers going- any numbers at all will due. The hills have eyes remember?

What?

I crap you not. She was all over me yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night too.

How much time off?

Almost that fast. I got a few loose ends to tie up first. Came into a shitload of money recently. I've always wanted to go to take a trip. We're just gonna walk into the airport and decide right then and there.

I followed her Trevor. I got to know her life. And what a boring one it was. Six a.m. gym, nine a.m. trendy coffee shop, noon bookstore, one soap operas, four o'clock news, five wait for Trevor to come home. And wait and wait and wait. Nine o'clock get ready for bed. 

I've been in here before.

Where's Allison?

Allison Dormere. Your intern.

I said she's been missing for-

No, making another woman compete with someone who's been dead eight months. That's cold.

What?

Uh... eighty two?

You've been cheating on me haven't you?

In a word? Lucrative.

For me? Trevor! How romantic! Come here, you.

I don't work here.

Ambulance.

Wow you are out of it.  

All you've got is the here and the now Trevor. That's all anyone really has. Maybe this will make things easier to understand. A man goes to sleep every night and has recurring dream that he's a butterfly. In time he begins to wonder if he might actually be a butterfly who dreams he's a man. And at the end of the day does it even matter? All these events you're describing. How can you be sure any of them really happened?

I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams.

For starters. It's also got fennel, asparagus, olives, some more of mother nature's aphrodisiacs... Back in college, me and my roommates used to call it hard- on stew.

Nah, I fucked it up.  I was tryin' to impress this kid, don't ask me why.  I was gonna rescue his old man, but I couldn't find the poor bastard.  He musta blew up.  I got the hell outta there.  I didn't have the nerve to face the kid.

I sell them at the recycling center. Gives me a little for gas and food.

What am I, a goddamn postman?  I'm way the fuck up here, I'm scared a heights, and you want me to deliver a letter?  Put a stamp on it for Chrissake!

I was in the can, for Chrissake.

Lighten up, John.  You think <u>you</u> got problems for Chrissake?

And give a deposition to the jUdge.

I got your bail continued.

We can hope.  You still have your job, right?

Twenty-five grand is peanuts!  All you gotta do is get me outta here long enough to collect.

So you can call me "naive," Mister LaPlante.

Nine.  I think.  Maybe ten.  Yeah, ten.  Nice kid.

You couldn't have a problem, Chick, because I personally have got them all.  I cornered the whole goddamn market.  You wouldn't believe... Oh, how ya doin'...?

I wouldn't be depressed about it, Bern.  A guy don't have to be heroic to be a human being.

OUT!  I TOLDJA.  JESUS CHRIST, I GOT CUSTOMERS WAITING!  AN' YOU WERE GONNA GO OUT LIKE THAT?  AN' MEET THE PUBLIC IN STOCKING-FUCKING-FEET?

Why doncha let me in so we don't wake everybody in the neighborhood?

He's in bed!  You're not gonna wake him and make him crazy, do you understand?  He comes home from the zoo, he wants to know if Elliot's a "war hero" like you... he wants to know how many people you killed...

How not all of them own apartment complexes, how not all of them play the stock market, how not all of them rent babies when they're panhandling.  He's ten years old, Bernie!  Impressionable!

The cops!  What kinda bullshit is this?  Is this America or -- ?

If anything happens to John BUbber, Mister LaPlante I'm going to see you prosecuted to the full extent of the law.

Yes, everybody <u>is</u> in love with John Bubber.  The whole country, in fact. And they're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money-grubbing low-life fence...

You media people, you think you can just go anywhere you want, spy on people.

Who am I?  You're asking me?  You're the big expert for Chrissake!  I'm what?  The "Scumbag," right?  The sleazebag something or other, the blackmailer, the...

"The Nomm"?  What's that?

Uh, no.

You're a celebrity, John.  People are going to want to please you... or use you... or both.

John, I'm sure she could support just about anything.  I think I'll see you to your room. A sort of bodyguard.  Make sure no harm comes to you.

You're sitting on your ticket.

The story behind the story, the ugly scandal behind the falling millionaire, the dirt, you mean.

You said all the passengers were accounted for...

A "mystery guy!"  "Not a passenger." Who?

She's flying to New York.  She's been nominated for a Silver Mike...

It's a wonderful piece.  Emotional. I love it.

Relax, Wally.  He had the shoe and the shoe checks out.

Listen, Deak, what if Bubber <u>has</u> got something to hide?  What if he's the wrong guy, not really the hero...?

What?

An hour after...!  Deak, for Heaven's sake!  Let's give her a night in New York City.  We'll put her and her boyfriend up at a good hotel...

He's pretty... remarkable.

So this really does the trick, eh?

Okay.

They're really white.

Nah, that's some guy fixing the living room floor.

It's great.  It's clean and airy and quiet -- there are trees and flowers.  There's still some fixing up I have to do, but it's coming along.

Actually, I have met someone. There's a woman I think I like.

-- a sense of proportion.

Who doesn't?

Sure.

Yeah, I've always been able to make my way in the world.  I don't like having to rely on other people.

Uh huh.

It's okay, baby, the police are coming.

The same thing -- his business pressures, the whole move and everything.  He's frantic about nailing this new job, worried about screwing over his present boss.

Because you'd have to get up at five a.m., would you like that?

Here, take this out to the table.

He's staying with a friend.  Hurry up now, you'll be late for school.

Mom, I heard someone downstairs!

No, thanks, Mom -- I'll go up to bed now.

What?

It's a nice pool, isn't it?

It's very nice, but it's still a little pricey for us.

Paul Newman in "The Hustler."

Damn.

What?

Huh?

All new houses have noises.

Someone nice will find him if he gets lost.

There <u>are</u> people who do things because they <u>want</u> to get caught.

Honey, I'm sorry, I think the vacation will be a good break for both of us.  You'll see.

Did you lock the garage door?

That's not a decision for you to make on your own.

No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here.  And if you want to talk to me -- <u>call</u>.

We'll talk in the morning.

What for, dickweed?

No.

Rudolf?  C'mere, Rudolf!

No.

Oh yeah?  Where's the bed?

Even cosier.

Would you?

It's not a homicide, Lieutenant.

We don't have any proof of that.

We sent the prints we lifted from the counter at the bank to the State computers, the FBI and interpol. Nothing.

Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.

A few days ago.

You didn't bring me here to talk about her.

Aye.

No.  He was my brother.  He died at anothers hand.

Who are you?

That's all?

That is what bothers me.

And what do you think you will find in another land?

Then it's worth the journey.

I'm sure they will.

If it came down to it what would you do?

How long is the voyage?

Me?  Of course.

I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone.

It's done.

No -- I will.

She's a treasure she is.

I know that for six months you've worked hard and asked for little. That you're a good and honest man. What more need I know?

He was wearing a bullet proof vest.

This is.  Go home.  Stay out of this.

Jennifer.

You remind me of someone I used to know.

Then how did he know your name?

I wanted to get to know you better.

--the Calan.  Do you know who they are?

So?

--for three hundred years.

Not unless they're immortal.

And the other one -- he is like you?

He will not stop until it is over.

How could they get by him?

I don't think it is a duplication.

I like my work.

It will not end tonight.

No.

Aye -- that I would, lass.

No.  The money, please.

That would be the girl who opened the door.  Are the others inside?

Fuck guessing.  You keep your mouth shut.

The cell phone is registered to a jewelry store in Beverly Hills.  The phone company shows no unusual --

Yes, sir.  But what about the disks?  If the cops end up with the disks, we're gonna see a whole lot of heat.

What do you want to do?

Maybe Glen already picked up the disks.

I have contacts in Los Angeles.  Lawyers and judges who can help you.

We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!

You're being stupid.  Check out the bathroom.  Maybe we can sneak out a window --

That's why we tied him, dumbass.  Now come here and see this --

That's crazy, Dennis.  The cops will see us.

What are you talking about?

How about your two friends?  You don't have a man dying in there, do you?

Fuck that.  They're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away.

What?

I need you to let me talk to Mr. Smith.

Give up, Dennis.  Let these people go. At least you'll have your life.

Aw, Jesus, not more of this.

Dennis.

That would be Mars Krupchek.  Jesus, he works for me, too.

Mr. Jones is dead.  So are two of his men.  The other three are in jail.  I have the disks.  I have Walter Smith. And you know what, you motherfucker?  I have you.

You'd better be kidding.

I don't know what you're talking about.

Mars?  What are you doing?

Do you want to go or not?  I'm offering you a way out of here.

Junior Kim was DOA at the hospital.

Could you call me back on your phone? Right away.

Other people can hear us.  Just call. <u>Please</u>.

Looks like you're bailing out at the right time.

Don't question me, Captain!  This is <u>my</u> crime scene!

Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it?

Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's name.

What?

Where's the office?

We're okay.

In my room.

I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office.  Could you find them and see who they belong to?

No!  They're right here --

Follow the Mustang.  We won't go far.

Do you think I'm going to let you <u>murder</u> someone?!

I'll go in that fuckin' house right now! I'll give those disks to the <u>real</u> FBI, you COCKSUCKINGMOTHERFUCKER!!  And I've got <u>Smith</u>!  <u>I've got Smith</u>!!

I guess we do.

They're killing everyone. The Lady Minister! The UN soldiers. They're at the gate.

Gregoire will deal with it, excuse me.

Cockroaches?

Yes, it is a calamity for us all.

Do you know how to open the safe there?  Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it.

Let me explain.

There is nothing to it.

I don't have it here. At the Mille Collines. I can get it for you.

You want to buy anymore cockroaches ask for Captain Naramunju.

No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels.

Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance.

Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?

That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the Militia are getting ready to storm the hotel.

Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise.

It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I thought you'd like it. Anything you need, gentlemen, let me know.

Watch everything? How? They are gone.

Well rewarded Those were his words.

The front gate would be best, General.

I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?

Whiskey?

No, sir.

How so.

I am on a list! What list?

If you do not help me, you will stay on that list.

Who will tell them? You need me to tell how you helped the hotel. The others who have gone, they blame you for all their misfortune. They say you led the massacres.

Politics is power, Paul. And money.

Business is good at the hotel?

You have no whiskey?

Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?

I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.

This goes out live?

I would never do that.

Call, sir?

Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina.

What?

I need a great favor.

Move? Where to?

The third floor are low class rooms.

We can't wait. We all go together or not at all.

I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.

We must do something.

He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?

Dawn. Then they go.

Where are you hurt, son?

I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room.

He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?

Please go back, bring the children to us.

What are you saying, Tatsi?

No! Sit down now.

Paul! Then another voice.

There is one thing I need right away.

What's wrong?

You are with me, Zozo, don't worry.

Name's Pritchett. Watson Pritchett. I own the house, my father built it. And now I just need to get you into it. So...

Not at all!

-- uh, excuse me, just one quick question? How long before this damn thing unseals itself?

I got an engraved -- literally -- invitation -- with my name --

Well, until that's found, I think it's a good idea we all stick together.  Or wouldn't that fit into your plans, baby?

I don't know!!

Yeah, me too.

Nonsense! Just bad press. All the deaths that occurred inside -- my own father's included -- all perfectly normal fatal accidents.

I lied. The House is alive and we're all gonna die.

A cleaning crew's supposed to arrive at 9:30 tomorrow morning -- I think the power of the house fades at dawn.

Price didn't make the guest list... The house did. It wants vengeance.

What?

Me? You've gotta be kidding.

Over here!

Hey, if everybody's gonna kill each other, could you do it in another room? I'm trying to get something accomplished here.

-- not a chance -- there's too much weirdness down there I don't think even bullets are gonna stop.

Back where?

He's gotta still be down here.

For chrissake give me a hand!

Run.

Yeah. And under other abnormal circumstances, I think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones.

I hope not.

Finding ways for me to die at these things is really your deal, isn't it? The "O.J." knife with the not-quite- retractable blade? Your "Jim Jones Kool- Aid" that was exactly that?

You're hurting me.

My guests were shredded. It's your sick little scene now, Steven: enjoy. I'm going to go run scalding water on the places you just touched me, and then I'm calling a cab.

Really? Well, let it rip.

Only one way I can think of, Sweetheart.

If I had one, Evelyn, I think you know who'd be first and last --

-- witnesses to what? You're already dead, Evelyn! Happy Birthday, baby --

Steven??

Sorry, Pritchett, here you go.

Very good. Well, I think I can say with complete honesty: I've never heard of any of you.

Good way to get your head blown off.

I never saw you --

Not just yet. Would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement?

The lockdown thing.

I was just sitting here -- it happened. I had nothing to do with it.

Pretty amazing feat: all that shit down the basement and your wife's up in the bedroom the whole time.

It better be -- he still owes me $25 grand for renting the place for the night! Here, let's get you some illumination so you can make your way safely!

Why not?

You'll never find it, it's a maze down there.

I said we shouldn't come down here. Very treacherous -- physical and metaphysical levels, both. There've been no refurbishments to this part of the house -- it's exactly as it was in 1931.

Not ghosts... at least not what you're thinking... Vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house...

Keep talking, I'll find you!

What was her name?

Why don't you pass me your plate?

No!

A few years older, perhaps.

It's origin is unknown.  The symbol does correspond  to a dagger I acquired many years ago.

Pearl, is the twilight, the divinity... Onyx is the sickle, death...

I didn't do anything, mommy.

Yes.

She talks to me.

Ok...

I'm scared!

Yes, we'll be leaving soon.

We're going to go someplace new.

We'll get it later.

Where is she now?

Ok.  If you want this room, you can have it.

He's blessing the house.

Ok ok...we're just gonna head inside here...

The place is pretty dusty.

Aubrey knows more about us than you think.

You didn't think much about that before.

Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her?

What about keeping an open mind?

Ok...

What?

What's happening!

You'll have to settle for turkey.

I took pity on the poor woman. This house is too big for one person to live alone in...

What!

Come back to us honey!

Good night.

What are you getting at!

It can't hurt you if you're not afraid Aubrey.  Think about us. We're here for you, we love you...

We'll be there.

So is that what all this is? Someone have a problem with us living here?

Not at all, if it can help.

What?

I know what I saw.

Correct.  The fields of France.  And many dead flowers ... Oh.  Forgive me. My name was Spenser.  Elliott Spenser. Captain.

And why are you back?  Why are we here?

I don't know ...

Then tell me what to do.

So where is it?

It's nothing to do with me.  I wasn't even with him.

Where?

I want to talk to you.  We met ... now, listen, don't hang up, OK? ... We met at the hospital last night.

Of course tonight.  Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something ...

That's great.

No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything.  It's just I don't dream.  Never have.  ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams.  I'm jealous.  It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean?

I'm trying to quit.

Did you know him?

Taken what?

Wait a minute.  He was already ... wounded ... when you found him?

No.  I buy them to impress people.  Of course I've read them.

I don't think so.  But it's a fascinating subject.  Did you ...

And he still sits there?

Maybe he thinks it'll come back.

That you found.  What do you mean you found it?

God knows.  Anything.  Contacts.  Clues.

What else came with it?  Anything still here?

I don't know.  Maybe.

No.  Really?

Unh-unh.

Right.  Like you were hog-tied or something.

Fuck you!

Good ... Good ... Look, why don't you come over?  You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk.  Just see how we both feel?

Not now, no.  I mean - now that you're here, it's like she doesn't even exist, you know what I mean?

Yes!  God, yes.  I ... I just want to hug you.  To hold you.  To tell you it's alright.

Your timing, and your shoes, are impeccable...  Good to see you, Alex, been having a lousy day.

Oh, not much.  Mario Brothers want me to do a job.

Hmmm, nasty little safe on the 7th.

There goes five seconds...My record's eighteen.

Rutherford Auction... that name...

Hey, you promised......Don't worry, I'm wearing my girdle.

"Every day you meet quite a few."

Don't worry, we'll get it...

Anna, I think you better stay....

I don't want to sound immature, but we were here first...

I can't believe you didn't notice. My weight.  I lost ten pounds in Rome

Let's just forget it, I mean...

Too-do-loo, babe.

Snickers, make the list happen. Oh and it's one thing to play hide and seek with the Mayflower's pathetic staff, but we're sore losers.  I've put jumper cables on the nipples of children and not always in the line of duty.

Close call, but she's our only way of keeping tabs on that damn mysterious Vatican organization. Hawk, it's time to go to the principal's office....

No, your Eminence.  I think he's going to steal the Codex, as early as next week.

He came into a world where crime is a legitimate business tactic and a legitimate government procedure.  But he knew Right and Wrong.  Oh, and we kind of messed around...

Fantastic.  Perfection.  The Vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder.

Delivers up to ten at night.  The Pope has an obsession with his Easter Seals.  It's actually not that an unusual set-up.  The secret passageway on the other hand....

I don't steal stuffed elephants from little girls.  And I buy my own clothes.  My life's a little boring...

What are your plans for the weekend?  Hoisting away the Colosseum?  Tell me, did the devil make you do it or did Darwin and Minerva Mayflower?

Ooh, I guess I do know something Here's looking at you, kid...

Oh, I must have put too much ethyl-chloride in it.

You re not "some guy" anymore, Hudson.  Right now, you're the only guy.  Without your help, I....

Holy sh-h--things are going to get very interesting, very fast. Da Vinci would be proud of you.

When the Mayflowers find out we have the Codex, they're going to want to make a deal...

Sure.  Face down.  Two endearing shots to the back of the head. That's your mark, man.  What did Little Eddie ever do to...

Baseball, why?

Poor baby..... Here, Bunny.

Whatever.  You own Boardwalk, you own Park Place, you own the four railroads.  You think you're God. For all I know, you're probably right.  I just wanted to have a damn cappuccino, maybe play some Nintendo after I find out what it is.  Man, why didn't you just <u>buy</u> the horse?  What am I saying, you did buy it...

If you're pausing for a "thank you," give it up.  So boss, you going to tell me what the crystal piece inside the pony means?

Yes.

Weren't you the bartender at Jonestown?

For God's sake, chain this convict.

You go back, you won't be alone. You'll have a diabetic barkeep cellmate.  You're still young enough to have fun shanking child molesters for a pack of smokes, but "Alex" will go in knowing that the next time he gets out it'll be to attend his own funeral. Depressing.

And to think I thought you were Evil Incarnate in pumps.

When it rains, it pours.  Name's Snickers.  The plane leaves in 40.

I used you as a diversion.  while you were getting captured upstairs, I was shredding documents in the basement.  Deep down, I guess I was just jealous.  You were one incredible thief...

We blow up space shuttles for breakfast.  You and your friend Alex would be a late afternoon Triscuit.

With a little jazz.

Well, that even surprised ole Moses at fust. I didn't think the Board was that smart.

Well, maybe I --

But, Al, it's the bunk! Norville showed me his design for the whatsit the day I met him! Why Buzz couldn't have invented it -- look at the man -- he's an imbecile!

Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays. Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it? She's probably very unattractive and bitter about it.

I bet that's exactly what she tells herself! But you and I both know she's just a dried-up bitter old maid. Say, how about you and I grab a little dinner and a show after work? I was thinking maybe The King and I --

Oh. Nothing, really, just... the more timid investors are no longer running for cover.

I understand that you're not very skilled yet in the secretarial arts. I'm not that skilled as president. Oh sure, I put up a big front --  -- not that everyone's buying it.

Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town?

Oh! Hello, Amy -- was it -- I thought she said, Mamie --

Know about it? You think the Board would do anything like this without my authorization? No, this was my idea from the start.

Just give me another chance, Norville -- I can help you fight this thing. I know this last story was a lie! We can prove it! We can --

Why not, it's all true! The board is using this poor guy! They're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap!

Says who?!

It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.

I --

I like to think so! It's this little idea I been working on!

Geez, I'm sorry, buddy --

Fired! You're fired! Is that plain enough for you, buster!

Get up!

Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I could have the job back.

Barnes! Where the hell have you been! And where's my voucher?!

I need that voucher! I told you a week ago it was important!

I --

Wait a minute!

Well, I'm a college graduate --

No, sir.

Sir! They voted me most likely to succeed!

Oh my God, sir!

Oh my God, sir!

But, sir!

-- So if you think it's appropriate, I'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch --

Twenty bucks says not here she don't find one.

She looks in her purse...

Plan two: Here come the waterworks.

She is!

We'll see if we can't make her well, Alma, you and I.

A puff-up, I call it.  But Miss Jessica always says "brioche."

But they came to a beautiful place, didn't they?

Oh, Mrs. Rand --

Nonsense, child!  I know Wesley's been drinking too much lately.  I know a great deal more about what goes on at Fort Holland than you'd think.  I know all about you -- that you're a nice girl, competent and kind to Jessica.  The Fort needs a girl like you.  But now we've got to get you back there.  I'll walk you back and stay over night.  It'll be a nice change for me.

You don't believe in it?

But you didn't have to come up here.

I've never heard of a cure.

Thank you.

At the Memorial Hospital -- here in Ottawa.

That's rather nice, isn't it?

Is she a doctor?

Mr. Holland?

It'll wait.

It's my day off.

It must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum.

Wait. I want to listen.

Yes, thank you.

I am not a frightened girl.

If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.

Of course not!

I'm sorry...

Good morning.

Well, I had a good time up to a point.

Still, I feel you should remove the decanter.  Wes is not an alcoholic yet, Mr. Holland. But as a nurse I can tell you that it won't be long before he is.

And instead,  I came -- bringing you nothing.

No.  It's not just how I felt toward Jessica.  I've been cruel to even you.

I am afraid, Wesley, he has that right.  And I will have to urge him to use it.

Yes, I said it, and I made myself believe it. But when I got here, Jessica was already raging with fever.

Insulin shock treatment is an extreme measure, Mr. Holland. But -- as Miss Connell pointed out when she suggested it -- this is an extreme case.

Paul, we're not trying to blame Miss Connell.  It isn't a question of blame.  It's a question of what we are to do with Jessica.  The commissioner is very concerned.

No -- it's about Mrs. Holland.  A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid.

I did everything I could to forestall this, Paul.  I don't think there's any question of your innocence in the matter.  But there's been too much talk.  The thing's out of hand.

Why?

Dr. Maxwell has very unpleasant news for us.

You're wrong, Wesley.  The guilt is mine -- all of it.

That night, I went to the Houmfort. I kept seeing Jessica's face -- smiling -- smiling because two men hated each other -- because she was beautiful enough to take my family in her hands and break it apart. The drums seemed to be beating in my head.  The chanting -- the lights --  everything blurred together.  And then I heard a voice, speaking in a sudden silence.  My voice.  I was possessed.  I said that the woman at Fort Holland was evil and that the Houngan must maker her a Zombie.

Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am.  Say, where's the wife?

No thank you. We should be off.

I'm just sad Ben -- I mean it was... you were, but, you know. I just don't know...

No, I didn't mean to sound negative. It was -- But Ben.  What is going to happen with us? Have you --

See for yourself.

Elena, what are you're talking about?

In the car.

I'm not staying at this party so we can go home with someone else's wife. That's not why we're here, right? We're simply being neighbors here, and I think we should do just that --

Ben.

Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?

Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?

Well good. Just confirming. You'll be on the 3:50 Wednesday afternoon.

Hnnn.

Uh, dad, you know I'm 16.

Sure dad.

You're boring me. I have a husband. I don't particularly feel the need for another.

Damn right, but where the hell were you?

Jimmy? Jimmy? I don't know how to take this. And what do you mean, Jimmy? I thought you said you and your husband --

Good night kiddo.

Nothing.

-- 73, and divorce is as easy as paying off a traffic ticket, and for crying out loud, Ben, be a man and just get it over with. I would have if I'd had the chance.

Ben, I'm going to Florida. I hate Thanksgiving and I hate the cold. I have a new nurse. She's a negro, she weighs three hundred pounds, and I've decided to leave my entire estate to her.

Sure is good shit. It's opiated. I had it in my chamber for a while. I was smoking this other --

A key party?

What the hey. Let's go for a drive.

Nah, that wasn't in the contract.

Sure. Maybe coffee.

It's not a bother.

It's really quite all right.

I suppose my reluctance was the group aspect of it -- I've never been much of a joiner, although I still consider myself a somewhat religious person --

They say you never forget.

Forget how to ride a bike.

My man, I speak to you solely as a comrade in arms offering unconditional aid. I've been giving this one a lot of thought, and I believe that the two of you together might just reach that higher ground that --

Major.

Yeah, Paul, are you gonna get home okay?

Groovy.  Young master of the revels, a treat for our hostess?

You going to tell dad?

You know, it's the whip -- the one uncle Frank got me from Mexico.

No!

Who said so?

I don't know.

I don't know.

Watching what?

Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much.

What are you doing at home on a Friday night?

Wants me to keep him posted on all your movements up here.

Detective Eckhart!  I know!  Welcome to Nightmute!

Actually...

The Puffins and the Hawks.  We're in extra innings.  The Hawks have a really good line-up this year.

Then change it.

I don't remember.

Isn't that the difference between a good cop and a bad cop?  A good cop can't sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle's missing.  A bad cop can't sleep 'cause his conscience won't let him.  You said that once, remember?

We just gotta catch the bastard, right?

Right.  Got lost in the rocks.

What time was that?

I told her to come.

She flattered me about my writing.  Asked if she could visit me.  To talk about my books.

She'd come to me, sometimes in the middle of the night.  Bruises all over her back, her upper arms.  I pled with her to let me call the police, but she wouldn't hear it.  Wanted to keep it a secret.

Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing...

I'm always all business.

No.  He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.

The other guy?

Best friend?

What was?

Yes down at the station.

But you wanted to.

Yes.

There's nothing more to talk about.

Procedure went out the window a long time ago.

We had feared we were the only ones...

Ah! You have questions?

Then God does not exist...

Yes... My God...

Follow me - that way - through my cell -

I knew. I rescued you, didn't I? From the terrible dawn.

You dress me like a doll. You make my hair like a doll. Why?

Stop her Louis!

Does it?

Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.

Lestat taught you all you need to know about that.

Tell me why...you've got to tell me...

Don't mock me, Louis. Help me.

And you never cried -

Still my beautiful child.

How devilishly clever.

So you felt it too!

Yet you could do it to me! Snatching me from my mother's hands like two monsters in a fairy-tale! Couldn't you have waited? Six more years and I would have had that shape! And now you weep! You haven't tears enough for what you've done to me.

Then my luck would have changed.

I've come to answer your prayers. You want to die, don't you? Life has no meaning anymore, does it?

You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are.

Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -

Dying?

Where do you think, my idiot friend? We're in a nice filthy cemetery. Does this make you happy? Is this fitting and proper enough?

Vampires are killers. Predators, who's all seeing eyes were meant to give them detachment.

Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.

Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?

Lestat, what do you mean?

You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!

CLAUDIA!!!

We love it. I only wanted to prepare you.

You're not lying to me, are you?

I was human then. Might as well ask can an angel feel love. Both are blesses or cursed with a certain... detachment. Though whether angels take as long to learn it as I, I will never know.

If I could see what you've seen, feel what you've felt I wouldn't let it end like this! You need a like to the world out there, a connection... then it won't end like this...

It's our version of winter.  201 and 202. There's Scrabble and Parcheesi in the lobby. Enjoy.

Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great guy, nothing against old Ray, but he's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in Southport. Will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street.

I think we can classify this as an emergency situation.

Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose.

Come on, you can make it.

Why are you being like this?

Oh...it's not working right. You're home early.  Did I scare you?

It's gonna be great.

I don't know.

It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me.

It can't get worse. I mean, it's not like this was the first time I freaked out in class. I hardly ever get a full night's sleep, my grades suck, I'm this close from being thrown out of school.

It's...the anniversary. That's what's going on...Take it easy on yourself.

What?

It's...him.

It's my fault. I shouldn't have...I didn't think...

Hey, you don't have to appologize to me. I'm the one. I understand.  I'm going to take a walk and dry off.

It's in my room!

He's in it with Willis?

Why? Come on, Julie. Think. You'll get it. Will Benson -- Ben's son.

Hello?

I'd hate for you to have to blow...your whistle.

We gotta get out of here. Now.

Are you crazy? We're not staying here on our own.

Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for my friend, my very best friend, Julie James.

How's Julie?

He's probably the only one who can help us.

How much?

Not anymore.

No. I shot him.

How's the water?

You don't have to be a jerk.

You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --

How disappointing! I expected it was something more romantic. A temple to the Goddess of Love, perhaps.

Let us put it to the test. Protect yourself with every scientific precaution you can think of. I'll go out on the cliff and build a votive fire to Hermes -- not that I believe in him any more than I do in Science.

I donut understand.

No.  She shall not be left here.

That was my companion. She sings little peasant songs quite nicely -- a completely untrained voice, of course.

Of course. Tomorrow, perhaps, before I go?

How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..

On my word! That's what they believe.

Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --

Poor Cathy --

She has never mentioned her family.

But one must love a father.

) But Thea -- She stands in your way. I know you. I know your little hints  the way you can turn the truth into a lie --

You're planing something, Cathy.. But I won't let you - I'll warn them against you.

This is Dr. Drossos, chief medical officer of my division.

I wanted to be sure of something, General -- something that has always preyed on my mind. I have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in - entombed  imprisoned..

You ask that of me? You're afraid to live in your coffin. You know what that means?

Oh, now  now look here 

I can't understand that.

Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?

Listen to what I say --

Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.

Then foreclose!

So I suppose I should give it to miserable failures like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for me.

How would you like to get a ticket next week? Haven't you any romance in you?

I'm hurrying.

Ernie, I'm a rich tourist today. How about driving me home in style?

Bert, what's happened to this house? Where's Mary? Where's my kids?

Don't . . . George?

Merry Christmas.

Odbody . . . A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?

Well, I had a car, and it was right here. I guess somebody moved it.

It isn't me!

Why? Don't they believe in angels?

You're nobody. You have no identity.

Sit down? What are . . .

That's him when he was twelve, back in 1919. Something happens here you'll have to remember later on.

I want you to take a good look at that face.

That's the kid.

That's right. Not only that, but he gave his school money to his brother Harry, and sent him to college. Harry became a football star  made second team All American.

I know. I know.

Thanks.

Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit.

Joseph, now show him what happened today.

Want to give my flower a drink.

Yeah, all right. Now, I'll paste this together.

I know  I know, but you just go to sleep, and then you can dream about it, and it'll be a whole garden.

I'm not rubbing it in. Well, I guess we better run along.

Came back three days ago.

Oh, stop that grunting.

Can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on Mary?

Oh, George!

No.

Hope you enjoy it.

No. No.

Oh, now, Pop, I couldn't. I couldn't face being cooped up for the rest of my life in a shabby little office.

You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?

Couldn't want a better death. Lots of pretty girls, and we're going to use that new floor of yours tonight, too.

Come on, George, let's hurry.

Hiya, Marty. Well, it's old home week.

George . . .

How does anything like this ever start? All I know is the bank called our loan.

About an hour ago. I had to hand over all our cash.

Yeah . . .  . . . you can take this one off now.

The envious ones say that, George, the suckers. Now, I have stated my side very frankly. Now, let's look at your side. Young man, twenty-seven, twenty-eight . . . married, making, say . . . forty a week.

Well, what about the Building and Loan?

Have you notified the police?

You've passed me on the street almost every day.

Uh-huh.

I guess I'm not quite the football type. You . . . look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.

Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.

Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits you. Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on.

Gesundheit. This requires a little thought here.

Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind?

About coming in. Your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over to pay me a visit.

Oh, I worked there for a couple of vacations, but I don't know . . . I guess I was homesick.

Well, then, sit down.

Don't you like her?

Mary . . .

Yeah, just started.

Yes, I called him right away. He says it's nothing to worry about.

Just a teensie one  ninety-nine, six. She'll be all right.

Going up to see Zuzu.

Oh, shucks . . .

So's mine.

Someone pop your balloon?

Sean!  Listen!  Listen to me, Sean.

I hope that's the cousin.

I was counting on hours.

That's awful.

Lucky.  Lucky, lucky, lucky.

We're hung up on something.

Listen to Andy, Sean.

Let's just go sailing, okay?

Anyone got another set of sails?

Oh, yeah.  Sure.

N-o-o-o-o-o-o....

What camera?

Hey -- you can't do that.

You'll have to make up your own mind about that.

What about tennis?  Riding? fixing up old cars?  Bartending?

Yeah?

At least you're safe.  What about the others?

Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.

First things first.

We don't know that, do we?

That's it?  Probably?  Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around....

Sound?

My boss and your boss.  Sure.

And how.  I thought you wouldn't respect me.

MMMmmmorning....

In the den.

Use the little brush there.  Why were you at Santos'?

Are you going to be able to sleep?

That's great too.  Gorgeous.

What'd I say?

Fired me!  I'm not a hysterical man.  I'm responsible.  I know what I saw....

Of course.  Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....

I got a feeling.  I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you?

It's still a good idea.

Bullshit?  I'll give you bullshit -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it!

Someone has to do something.

1530 hours.  Might still be there. Base out.

What's daddy doing?

You stay with Mrs. Silvera, Tootsie. Okay?

Hiya yourself.

Sure they did....

Great.

None at all.  I wonder what the Brebner twins are doing tomorrow night.

Gaff rigged?  Why not a staysail schooner?  Go anywhere.  Look at this -- the Mayan, an Alden schooner.

What's that mean?

Huh?

Nope.

Mike?  Our Mike?

Untangle it and let's go -- We don't need a blackout on the island.

No.

I can go out if I want to.

We're fighting wind and current. I though we'd be out longer, catch the incoming tide.

Coming about....

Uh.  Well.  Maybe you could give Polo a hand going in....

Might as well.

Sean, baby, please....

When are we going out?  You and me?

Yeah.  Go on, beat it.

Yeah.

Quiet!  Shhh!

Okay, okay.  Close your door.

Brody's riding his tower.

Look, what am I supposed to do? It's done, it's over.  We have to deal with the consequences.

No one's ever caught a Great White except indirectly in fishing nets. I want to dart it and keep it alive.

Have you checked the bars?  The guy's irresponsible;  he's done this before.

Coming with us?  Overman's buying.

Yeah.  Down there.

She can take care of herself. She doesn't need you.

Hope I make it through both.

Everything's going wrong.  I'm having more trouble with Bobby than I ever have before.  I can't get him to respond.

I don't know.  I can't understand it.  Something's bothering them.

I don't like what he does.

Hi, baby.

That's a lot of ground to cover.

Let's not talk about that now, okay?

... Electrical connection malfunctioning.

Okay, stay.  We'll come back for you.

I talked you into this?

God, they're horrible.  I hate them.  Did you see its eyes?  How black they are?  The look in them?

Yes.

Yes?

Get some sleep.  And tell Sean I'm sorry.

... Mean through the tubes?

Well, that's why you got it.

Hydrophobia...

I can't!  My dad had it, and I don't know if you can inherit it or what, but I got it, and I hate it.  I can't stand it!

That's just it, Michael.  We don't!

That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.

You two go!  I'll call Calvin!

But you --

Make this quick!

No, no.  That won't do.

Well, I have to get this into the networks.  If you can't do it, you can't do it, that's all.

It's one of the world's greatest creatures.

I know it and I will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that!

Still sleeping.

So do I.  But for different reasons.

Somebody could have gotten hurt.

You're a strange man, Mr. Hutton.

We're all from the sea, Mr. Hutton. Our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans.  By continuing to destroy fish, man destroys himself.

Is there such a place?  A cave or something with such a flow?

And big for his age.

Ten minutes ago.

Not good enough.

Someone's looking for you.

No.  Of course not.  Don't listen to him.  He's - he's...  ... my brother.

Can hardly wait to do it again.

He's diving!

Taking my boyfriend to the airport.

Ohhhhh shhhhiiiit.

It's disappeared.

Calvin said it was all right.

Well, we're not going to hurt it, old boy.  I say, love, is Flipper ready to go?

Precisely.

Kind of dull in there for you, isn't it?  Why don't you throw in another shark?

Buzz off.

Yeah?  Well, in that case, have a drink.

What the hell's there?

How come you're so brave with all this stuff?

Five hundred yards.

Right, Mike.

Booked them all at Baskin- Robbins.

Who's grown up?

I want to see Kathryn.

Something wrong?

This company's expanding.  They got parks in Texas, Ohio, California.  I think I'm gonna be going to Waco.

No, really.  I've never met anyone like her before.  This is it.

That's what grandmas are for.

Sometimes my father puts me in his lap and lets me steer the Jeep.

But you always let me....

We don't have anything straightened out.  You're uptight about something ...what's wrong?

I don't know...You...I don't know.

What's wrong?  What happened?

It went away....

I can't help it....

I shouldn't interfere...  My mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock....

Do you enjoy dealing blackjack?

It's beginning....

We'll be there....

What difference does it make?  It's here....

We'll divert it...We'll do something....

I'm hungry, Mom....

Hello?  Thea who?  I know it's Thea Brody.  How many grandchildren do I have?  I know you can use the phone by yourself. You're a big girl.  I know you're five.

You can stay in my room.

It's not nice to be evasive.

Thanks for the consultation....

Mother....

I'm just getting started....

Don't be such a Grandma...I was always climbing something....

You're not a pain in the ass....

I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....

I have to get this finished.

There's a lot...I want to talk about it....

Promise me....

Mostly it feels like driving.  You digging for buried treasure?

They took me to the chief, who took a long look at me, then took me in his hut....

Nothing....

Give it up... Kick it in the ass... Get on with your life....

You're not going to bet it all....

You'll be sorry.

What?

Won't you get in trouble...?

There must be plenty of women who would be glad to go....

My vision is perfect....

You're the man who drives the plane.

Yes I can....

All you passengers are the same.... Complain...Complain....

She's had a lot to deal with...She needs time....

I'll get her.  Have a good Christmas, Matt....

Will you leave me alone...?

The readings suck....

You didn't stick them on right....

What?

As the sun slowly sets in the West, we bid a fond farewell to the family of conch....

Lots of times....

As long as he's been here....

Close...I don't know...Just get the hell....

You don't like my voice...?

The big picture...If we can't get him to swallow it, we'll shove it up his....

No way....

Gone to Ben Masters' place.  Cow tipping.

Claims kids come around at night and tip over his sleeping cows.  They're not giving milk.

Deputy Brody will take care of it personally.

Yes.

"Welcome to Eureka."

Watch my lips .. <u>Don't get into it</u> ..

Why don't you dump the "Fat Lady?"

Forget it. They got stringent hyg- iene rules. He's long gone in lime.

To throw out of the window.

How come the F.B.I. don't put anya this together? They work- ed over "Jennifer" for months?

Identity of whom? You got a girl, doesn't even have a driver's lic- ense? .. She's untraceable, John .. You need fifty detectives on this.

For a <u>dead</u> <u>dog</u>?

He didn't shoot it, Ross. And no way by accident. There's a flash-burn. It was point-blank.

No God, Brother. If there was a God, asses wouldn't be at the perfect height for kicking.

I never knew about the sailor the- ory, Ross. He might have that one little thing I need in his files?

You don't really believe this?

We're not <u>here</u>. I don't want the desk to hear us ..

I thought it was Taylor's case?

No, Sir.

I want Serato ..  Why can't I have Serato?

You ain't talking to no one, till you calm down.

Fucken noddle's hanging off ..

Average rainfall, 48 inches. Pisses down, October to June.

Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case!

Hey, c'mon, country boys, let's all line up and hear the expert.

Well, her, it ain't. That bitch is blind as a blonde fucken bat.

I've heard you call him Freddy.

Why not? You heard my voice?

I don't know. I guess she must have called him John? I'm mak- ing tea. Would you like some?

No.

Yes.

No, just a minute or two .. I knocked on your door - no one home, so I followed the music ..

Hamlet. Have you read it?

Well, I'm glad we got the conver- sational side of lunch over with.

There's no one "looking at you" .. There's hardly anyone in here. The only person looking at you, is me.

Have you known her long?

How d'you know what I'm like?

Please don't ask no quest- ions now .. Not right now ..

I been told to take your car in, Sir.

The man from the F.B.I.

Then let me put your mind at ease .. Firstly, Amber isn't "blind" - she has some useful vision - and second, this isn't a prison, it's a college of higher education - a severe vis- ual disability doesn't mean my stud- ents don't value their independence as much as anybody else - and Amber was a very independent young woman - She decided to leave - so she left ..

Don't mix very well with beer.

Even better.

I'm sure he is. But gettin in- to the "element" is a bad idea.

Well, that's who she is. Cept she can't run away.

Ask him.

Sooner... or later... I'll have to stop.

Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either --

What do I do?  How do I spin this?

Could you just stop moving?

-- stop --

Listen to me, it's over.

Just be friendly and say "no comment."

Bill, Rod, wait --

Give me your number.  I'll call tomorrow.  I'm just a little. I'm a little insane right now.  But it's going to be great.

Hello?

Shit, it's just so frustrating to not be able to talk to Avery --

Thanks.

Hi.

Yeah.  That too.  I broke up with Avery.

Good idea.  Thank you.

What you wrote inspired me. _ 79.

Sorry about this hand.  You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?

Oh shit.  You said "boss."

Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.

Yeah, what happened there.

Fine, I just --

Look, just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes... whatever...  Don't make a joke of your life. Go back and read what you wrote. You're better than the rest of them, better than the Bob Sugars, and don't forget it.

...my soul or something. _ 117.

So this break... is a break-up.

Of course I know --

Oh, well, why didn't you say so? And oh, I don't know if you're interested in this detail, but I was just about to tell you that I love him.  I love him, and I don't care what you think.  I love him for the guy he wants to be, and I love him for the guy he almost is. I love him.

Ten seconds, Rod.

I brought Denver to twenty million. Denver deals with me all the time. You listened to Sugar? You let that snake in the door.

Yes.

Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.

I'm not about love -- I'm about "showing you the money."

Get some sleep.  See you tomorrow.

I understand your anxiety.

Great word.  Towel?

Fine.

You're hanging by a very thin thread, dude.  And I dig that about you.

Rod, get on the camel.

Damn right.

We still having dinner in L.A.?

Jerry Maguire.  SMI.

I'm not your brother!

Okay.  I've been hogging it. You're right.  _ 76.

Yeah I know.  I did.

We'll go to the zoo sometime. Okay? I think I might have some time on my hands.

I'm scared.  What is it?

And tell your wife to stop making so much noise! We're food to these damn animals.

What is it?

What?

Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.

Because "Dr. Grant" isn't looking for Eric. Dr. Grant is looking for the coast.

Nothing.

Its not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out here somewhere. Our baby is all alone.

Eric!

Think.

Never had a doubt. Never did. Us Kirby men, we stick around, huh?

But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that.

I would completely support that.

What about Eric?

DAD!

I know. I know. I want to look for him too.

He loves you too.

I didn't know, there were two islands.

It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan data from the raptor skull, than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints, one layer on top of the other. It's the future of paleontology.

They're here.

Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right you can see...

Obviously a superpredator.  Suchimimus. that snout.

Sorry, Alan it's been six years.

It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park, you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.

In Costa Rica?

You'd be surprised what people can do when they have too.

Which one do you prefer?

It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight weeks.

Yeah.

A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.

I stayed pretty close to the compound, Figured if anyone came to look for me, that's where they'd start.

Then we go home?

The population will Stabilize eventually. They'll adapt to fit different roles.

Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.

I guarantee it'll be worth your while.

Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe. These guys are really good. One of them was a Green...

There is. I own a place called Kirby Paint and Title Plus. We're out in the Westgate Shopping Center in Enid, Oklahoma. The "plus" is for bathroom fixtures, fireplaces accessories, patio furniture. Stuff like that.

That cheap aftershave I send you every Christmas, you actually wear it.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit down, what brings you to Mombassa?

Just a little bit too much, I think.

A true hunter doesn't mind if the animal wins.  If it escapes.  But there weren't enough escapes from you and me, Ajay.  I've decided to spend a bit less time in the company of death.  Maybe I just feel too close to it my--

It doesn't matter what I think.

Like if you shoot yourself in the foot?  Wouldn't matter.  You'd be dead  before you realized you'd accidentally pulled the trigger.

The hatchery, in particular?  You know my initial yields had to be low, far less than one percent, that's a thousand embryos for every single live birth.  Genetic engineering on that scale implies a giant operation, not the spotless little laboratory I showed you.

After the accident at the park, a hurricane wiped out our facility on Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. And they did.  For four years I've fought to keep them safe from human meddling, now I want you to go there and document them.

John . . .

Ian, you are my last chance to give something of real value to the world. I can't walk so far and leave no footprints; die and leave nothing with my name on it.  I will not  be known only for my failures.  And you will not allow yourself to go down in history as a lunatic.  You're too smart.  You'e too proud.  Dr. Malcolm.  Please.  This is a chance at redemption.  For both of us. There's no time to equivocate, we must seize it now, before --

-humidity, I know.  Highest lead density on the market.

You gotta be kidding.  You dragged me out of Greenpeace to be a corporate stooge?  You couldn't get anybody else?

No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own once in a while.

Because you said so.  Maybe nobody else believed you, but I always did.

Where does it say that?

Exactly what John Hammond wanted us to do.

You heard his, Dieter.  Find a new spot.  And remember, we're after herbivores only -- no unnecessary risks.

I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.

You've broken its leg!

Why?

You're going too?

Oh, my God.

Dr. Juttson, please take Kelly back to camp right away.  Leave the other car for us and we'll meet you there in an hour or so.

No.

I have to find Kelly!

What's that?

I believe in him.

Ian, if we recall the boat now, we've made two invasive landings in one day.  That'll have to go in any paper I write, and it will leave room for people to say our findings were contaminated.  You know the academic world as well as I do, once they smell blood in the water, you're dead.  Our presence has got to be one hundred percent antiseptic.  That means if we bend a blade of grass, we bend it right back the way it-

Ian, nothing we observe will be valid if we're trailing along in the wake of an army.

I'm trying!

You go if you like, but we're not waiting for you.  MOVE IT OUT!!

The door security systems are shutting down.

Find Nedry!  Check the vending machines!

I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -

Yeah, again, in  theory, but - -

How would we cut off the lysine?

Remember - - viable embryos.  They're no use to us if they don't survive.

Are you sure?

We're - - still perfecting a viewing system.  The raptors seem to be a bit resistant to integration into a park setting.

Control?!  You never had control!  I was overwhelmed by the power of this place.  So I made a mistake too.  I didn't have enough respect for that power, and it's out now.  You're sitting here trying to pick up the pieces. John, there's nothing worth picking up.  The only thing that matters now are the people we love.  Alan, Lex, and Tim.  And John, they're out there where people are dying - - people are dying, you know?

If they died together, they lived together. Suggests some kind of social order.

Yeah, I know, you know...kids.  You want to have one of those?

The Cretaceous.

Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!

Small versions of adults, honey.

Can't we see the unfertilized host eggs?!

Dilophosaurus.

It's my favorite.

- - which is called a gizzard, and it helps them mash their food, but what happens after a while - -

I'll just finish.  Yeah, I want to finish.

What's that?

When people try to control things that it's out of their power - -

It changed.  Why?  Okay, back over your wrist.  Because and here is the principle of tiny variations - - the orientations of the hairs - -

Yeah.

He sends his apologies.

Relax Donald, relax.  They're scientists.  They ought to be curious.

Really?

Tim, I'll come back for you.  I'll get Lex out first.

Yes it is.

That's a good idea.

"Thunder lizard!"

It's so strong!  Look at its nose.  Need help?

Tim, I'm right here.  Easy catch.  Easy catch.  Count to Three..

Try to!

Kids get scared.

I didn't say I was scared.

When you gotta go, you gotta go.

What kind of opinions?

No, I'm sorry, that  wouldn't be possible.  We've just discovered a new skeleton, and - -

- - this would be an awfully unusual time - -

After careful consideration, Dr. Grant - - so have I.

It's safe.

All night.

It's okay!  It's okay!  It's a brachiosaur!

You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!

Yes.

Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler -- you've heard of Chaos Theory?

Don't you see the danger, John, inherent in what you're doing here?  Genetic power is the most awesome force ever seen on this planet.  But you wield it like a kid who's found his dad's gun.

I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, Dennis.  I really will not.

I'll keep an eye on it.  Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.

They're not monsters, Lex. They're just animals.  And these are herbivores.

Shut up!  You're scaring me.  Stop!  You're scaring me.

Ken, it's Bruce. Listen, we've got a nibble on the Pendleton financing.

Don't tell me you're still thinking of buying Casa de Psycho...

You want to put in chain saws?

And do you think they like the fact that half the country thinks Crystal Lake is filled with corpses?

Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...

Great.

Janet, goddamnit, what's going on?

That's my job.

I know how this sounds, but that's what happened.

_Krueger_...

He doesn't look like he's going anywhere, Bill. And if necessary, I can get a judicial order reaffirming the right of my client to speak to his attorney in private.

Who's chest?

Video store?

This is a legitimate cinematic genre. Just like Westerns, Comedies, Film Noire, Science Fiction...

One of the deputies is pretty cute. I think she likes me.

None of that's true?

I don't "rationalize" anything. I'm his lawyer -- he's my client. That's all.

We're going to need at least two full REM cycles to get a clear neurological profile. Three hours minimum, six hours ideal.

Don't you see? Jason was _asleep_. And he was dreaming -- the REM patterns prove that. And I saw finger blades just like Krueger's come out of Jason's chest. There has to be a connection.

A cameraman caught him on videotape. Joe, I saw an entire sheriff's squad fighting and losing against an enemy that wasn't there...

If I give you a bigger dose, it'll give you a heart attack.

The formality of a trial would be too costly for them.  They're beginning to understand that it's the ensuing news of our actions that incites support.

I haven't got the energy.  I mean, I have to conserve my energy.

A man must eat --  And drink.

There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.

Another one?

What an extraordinary request!

Not necessarily.  A <u>wife</u> would.

I gave it to him yesterday.

He has it, he just hasn't noticed it yet, all right?

Burgel, I thought it would be easier, as long as I was passing --

Yes.

Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.

You're just doing your job.

You must make the time.  Where do you go off to in the lunch hour?

Oh, I know you got along with that poor fellow -- what was his name?

One of you must be mistaken.

Excuse me, I have to copy this for Central Docketing by 2:30.

And you believe everything the authorities tell you.

Tonight?

I've hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from.

It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day.

You don't believe that.

First these nameless authorities were the root of all evil, now it's insignificant Burgel.  If indeed there was a mistake -- and a minor one at that -- you're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all.

Now Burgel's one of the authorities?

Should I tell you why I joined our late lamented nihilists? Why I became a murderer? Because murder ... is bliss.  It's easier than you might think to absorb and assimilate Evil -- once you've adopted its procedure.

There's a new potion -- he said it was perfected.

-- Listen to me --

Can I ask -- how you found me?

What makes you think so?

-- Should you happen upon anything that might be relevant.

That's not what I call conclusive evidence of an abduction.

You mean because it's been a while since there was a sunny day?  What a good detective you are.

You mean you've actually begun some?

That's obvious, isn't it?  We have an opening for a new member.

Oh, Burgel!  Gabriela was having an affair with Eduard.  They were both members of <u>this group</u>.  If any crime's been discovered and people are paying for it, I'd look to <u>yourselves</u>!

... A piece of paper ...

It only amuses me in that it gives me an insight into the ludicrous bungling that in some circumstances may decide the life of a human being.

Why would we keep files on <u>dead</u> employees?  All old files are sent up to the Castle.  Do you think we have room for two hundred years worth personnel records?

Dr. Murnau was the bravest of men. He spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain.  A great loss.

Of course not.  Only by a Director of the firm.  Who'd want to let in all kinds of riff-raff off the streets?

We're a medical firm, aren't we? They go to the Medical Records Section.

She went to the roof to sunbathe one lunch hour -- we watched her changing.

And we're upset too.

It doesn't matter.  It's too late for all of us.

Amerika for us!

Look Mr Denham - you're not welcome here. Just pack up your cameras and go.

A Neolithic bronze ... Reminiscent of the Nias Island cultures ... It ' s very curious. Defiantly Pagan. The use of ivory for the spear is quite unique ... What do you think?

I photographed it extensively, father.

How dare you? My father is the British Museum's most respected archeologist!

Relax ... it was fifteen years ago. I don't do it now.

Leave it, Ann.

Jack! This is the archeological find of the century!

We need those co-ordinates -someone's gotta get back there and jot the rest of it down

Exotic lands, primitive people, dangerous animals ... That's what the public expect from a Carl Denham picture! Lead us into the mountains, Sir!

Arlyn, he just wanted to ask some questions -- something you could help us about.

Please, if he sees you, he won't come!

And then one night -- at the gaming tables -- well I just saw him. A stranger -- looking at me -- and I knew suddenly that all my life I'd been --

Maybe this wasn't just a trick. Maybe you're in danger of real love, real involve --

Sorry. 

So do I.

Now there's a picture I'd like you to --

From the beginning I don't know why the hell he's messin with you. If he was me he'd know better. If he was even a city boy he'd know better. You're a whore Miss Daniel, that's the truth of it, right? Now somethin I'd like you to look at.

Here please.

Like for you to look for the man.

Miss Daniel? My name is Klute -- John Klute --

But you can't say that Dumper was Tom Grunemann.

What about everything since?

Just phone calls, right? They ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank. Kids getting kicks. Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that proves --

Look -- I'm sorry -- I've led everybody wrong. I mean yes, I get those feelings, but that's just me, that's just feelings.  I'm sure this will amuse you; I'm scared of the dark. And sometimes I get shook up, I hear people or -- well, I'll come out in the morning and think someone's been prying at my mailbox, or there's a little -- trash outside my door and I wonder if someone left it there for -- do you see? -- things other people wouldn't even notice. Well that's not real, it's just nerves; it's got nothing to do with --

OK.

Maybe, if you tell me the things you haven't.

Do you know where he got the dumper?

Is that what you gave him?

No.

Oh. No. Not that way. I'd say it was more -- I don't know --  -- too bad? Pathetic?

It got lonely upstairs. There's someone on the roof.

Thanks for the jolly news. I thought maybe you'd left town by now. You kind of just disappeared. But you boys from Tuscarora have a habit of disappearing, don't you?

Why?

You get the Christ out! You dumb stupid bastard, you don't know anything, you square, you get out! I don't have to show you anything; you get out!

We did this before.

I don't like getting splashed.

My bed.

I was wondering what that was.

You said it was over, right? You said not to worry any more, all over, right?

Maybe I wasn't there when you called.

Oh.  Well it wasn't us city people that did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked country boy.

OK.

Can you use these?

No. I'm sore.

How is it back there?

Someone's been doing all these things.

It's not so bad.

No. They never did, really. But that's what I'm going to recommend. The next step. Unless something --

Goodbye, Pete.

Two years ago? Sorry.

Look -- dad -- I may stand better with the cops than you.

I'd like to talk with Jane McKenna.

I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it.

I think she's trying that.

Then how are you involved?

Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me.

He called this morning from Tuscarora. Asked me to meet him at 3:00 at the downtown heliport. He's on his way to Chicago.

I believed her: the Dumper was not Tom Grunemann.

No sir, we don't state that. We're countin --

He's in his room, playing.

Do you like to be with your mommy?

Show...

Right.  One O.J. coming up.

No.  If I'm not here, you go home with Thelma and Kim.

Mom, I mean dad?

C'mon, there's not much difference--

No!

Don't let the bedbugs bite.

Sure.

No.

Boy, I bet you if mommy ever saw this she'd remarried you.

Where will my bed be, where will I sleep?

Six years.

Your honor, I would like to place in evidence a report on Mrs. Kramer's therapy by her therapist, Dr. Elinore Freedman of La Jolla, California.

Your honor, I would request a direct answer to a direct question.  Does she have a lover?

Objection!

Objection!

Eight, almost nine years.

Either you call and set up the appointment, or I'll call.  And if I call, you lose the commission.

No.

No.

How many lovers have you had-- permanently?

More than three, less than thirty- three--permanently?

Congratulations, Mrs. Kramer. You have just rewritten matrimonial law.  You were both divorced, Mrs. Kramer.

C'mon, Joanna, you don't mean that.  You're a terrific mother--

Okay, I understand and I promise I won't try and stop you, but you can't just go...Look, come inside and talk...Just for a few minutes.

So do you.

You can't tell it from a distance, Ted.

You've been living here, in the city?

Joanna, I don't give a--

Ted, if you can't discuss this rationally--

Beautiful.

You want to know the real kicker?  The real kicker is, for the first time in my life-- the first time--I feel like a loser.

Jim, I appreciate what you're saying.  I mean it, but I really think Joanna's coming back.

What?!?

I don't believe you.

I'm going to take it.

I know....I know.

First, there's no such thing as an open and shut case. Especially where custody is involved.  Got it?

I don't know, John...I mean, to be brutally honest, I'm not so sure what kind of mental shape Joanna's in right now.  Y'know she admitted she was seeing a shrink.

Do you want the kid or don't you?

When Joanna--  my ex-wife--when she was talking before about how unhappy she was during our marriage...Well, I guess most of what she said was probably true.  There were a lot of things I didn't understand-- a lot of things I would do different if I could.  Just like I guess there are a lot of things Joanna wishes she could change...But we can't.  Some things, once they are done, can't be undone.  Joanna says she loves Billy.  I believe she does.  So do I.  But the way it was explained to me, that's not the issue.  The only thing that's supposed to matter here is what's best for Billy...When Joanna said why shouldn't a woman have the same ambitions as a man, I suppose she's right.  But by the same token what law is it that says a woman is a better parent simply by virtue of her sex?  I guess I've had to think a lot about whatever it is that makes somebody a good parent:

The judge went for motherhood straight down the line.

Ordered, adjudged and decreed that the petitioner be awarded custody of the minor child, effective Monday the 23rd of January.  That the respondent pay for the maintenance and support of said child, four hundred dollars each month.  That the father shall have the following rights of visitation: every other weekend, one night each week to be mutually agreed upon and one half of the child's vacation period.  That's it.

We can appeal, but I can't guarantee anything.

It's going to cost.

Ted?  Are you there?

No, but--

But I'm going to have to take some stitches.

Fuck you.  He's my son.  I'm staying with him.

Ted, don't be so hostile.

Ted, Joanna and I used to talk a lot and...well, she told me a lot of...ah, things about the two of you.

I mean...things.  Ted, Joanna's very unhappy and--

Three.  And add some basil.

Uh, huh...

Ted, I just heard...

Kham, Holiness.

Again?

I know.

Will you buy the sheep for me?

It depends on the quality. And, that it be Indian.

Soon.

We did not.

I am afraid.

Time to study.

Yes.

If I were to go into exile, could we expect any serious assistance, from India, suppose?

How many?

I accept it. What is suffering?

I accept it. What are the causes of suffering?

I am him.

Roughly five thousand men.

No. Not very big.

And, America?

I had relinquished doubt.

I will not go.

We are traveling to Lhasa. May we...?

Does he have the spot?

I have smarter men.

Why is your beard so funny? Let me touch this.

You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.

Reting Rinpoche has been arrested. He tried to overthrow Regent Taktra. Today, he is brought back to Lhasa by government officials. The monks at Sera Monastery have been on his side. Now, there is trouble between them and the army.

Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me?

Oh yes.  I killed him.

Oh, but you <u>have</u>, Ma'am.  You lied to us, that could be obstruction of justice.  A man's been killed in part 'cause of your silence, I could make out a charge of reckless endangerment and I'm sure PETA would be annoyed at how you treat your cows.

<u>No</u>, <u>I</u> <u>did</u> <u>not</u>.  The crocodile <u>did</u> kill him, though. But it was all... it was a mistake.

Deep down, gut check.  I'm growing fond of <u>you</u> and it's liberating to say so.

You're crawling around like a--

A spring trap!

No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log.

Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong flushed him down a toilet.

Forget about him being God, he's thirty feet long, he <u>is</u> a miracle of nature, who somehow made his way to Maine.  This is a grand beast. <u>A</u> <u>grand</u> <u>dragon</u>.  An attempt should at least be made to capture him alive.

I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.

Bastard bit my chopper.

'Cause he just ate a cow, you stupid--

Jack.  We've all seen it.  He's probably a hundred and fifty years old, he's bigger than an elephant.

Right.

You ready on shore?

Thirty meters or so.  Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie.

Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger--

U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation.

You think I'm <u>that</u> nuts?

No.

You're not okay, your leg's a mess.

Yes, it <u>did</u> seem prehistoric but I'm sure he just carried the thing for luck.  Not that it <u>worked</u>, obviously.  It probably somehow got lodged into his body.

Ma'am, your first impression isn't going well.

Never been to Maine before?

Adult males will charge hatchlings. If there's one out there...

Because they just consult their little indigenous charts.

I am <u>not</u> staying on shore.

I am going out on that boat and why are you picking on me, is this some kind of--

Good.  See ya soon.

That's probably good.

I thought I might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints.

Excuse me?

You <u>did</u>, you--

A man just died, you're hitting on me with science.

I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.

It's okay.

Father's a surgeon.  I can even stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a bad idea here.

Keep it dry.  No swimming.

What?  Why... people have been killed, I hardly think I'm having a good time, why would...  Does it show?

Maybe.  I've always <u>read</u> about what's happened.  I've never... I know it sounds silly but, it's nice to be someplace <u>while</u> something is actually... y'know... happening.

You calm down!

Good idea.

Keep firing!

Back us in a little, we need to get a shot!

So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in <u>my</u> world who was good for <u>you</u> and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.

Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?

Ready.  A museum in New York sent us some additional back up.

Doesn't <u>look</u> like it.

Alright, Ms. Paleontologist.  I wanna know why that monster is here.  You got a theory?

Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here.

Was he swallowed?

Thank you, it's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you, you Fucker. 

I asked you to be nice to him.

Absolutely.

You work for me.  I'm not comfortable with-- y'know, "us"...

The somebody else part?

It has nothing to do with--

It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...

Shitbutt?

Pleading with a crazy man, with come all over my face.

Why does she keep repeating the name?

Hot damn, Clarice.

Where?

NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU

You might have suggested that in my office, and saved me the time.

Yes sir. I can find it by myself.

Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion.

Just briefly. What's the problem, Officer?

Jack Gordon.

I think we may be, yes.

I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know how to feel about it.

He starts this - buzzing in me, in my head. He makes me feel violated... You used me, Mr. Crawford.

They weren't there. Get close-ups.

It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters.

I'm wondering if he's done that before - placed a cocoon, or an insect. It would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater... Can we check back on that?

Then have the lab check Raspail's head.  Dr. Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues... They'll find another cocoon.

I think he means it, this time. I think he'll deal.

They'll use their best men. But they better be paying attention...

Starling, we know who he is! And where he is. We're on our way now.

Chicago's only about 400 miles from here. I could be there in -

I think so.

Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.

Witless and misleading. Why do you think he takes their skins, Officer Starling? Thrill me with your wisdom.

Why? Do you know something about him?

Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find?

Because you weren't wasting my time.

I don't know. Next time I'll have to check.

I'm waiting for your offer, Clarice. Enchant me.

Tell me. Don't lie, or I'll know.

You're very frank, Clarice. I think - it would be quite something to know you in private life.

Why so briefly?

Clarice... you're hardly in a position to accuse me of lying.

What was it?

Yes...! They were screaming.

I took one lamb. And I ran away, as fast as I could...

Yes...

Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter.

Well, Clarice, have the lambs stopped screaming...?

Dr. Lecter -

It may be that - I could confer with my colleagues on this. And get back to you.

The Latin name comes from two rivers in Hell. Your man - he drops these girls into rivers, every time. Didn't I read that?

Duncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora doesn't marry you, I shall.

Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you.

And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with?

Top of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are downhill of it.

Miss.  May I?

No. I will find you.

Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying.  And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of sedition, too!

He delivered no such message.

Dark haired...

No blood vengeance? No re-proach or insult?

No.

Then you are one of those who would allow England to fight alone while she protects you from France?

Only chance we got is...  ... to get more distance on 'em and go to ground!

No.  Huron serve no one. The French father believes he fooled Magua because he is so proud of his cleverness, he is blind. But it is the Huron path that Magua walks down, not the French one... Now, Les Francais, also, fear Huron. That is good. When the Huron is strong from their fear, we will make the terms of trade with Les Francais. And we will trade as the white man trades. Take land from the Abnakes; fur from the Osage, Sauk & Fox. And make the Huron great. Over other tribes. No less than the whites, as strong as the whites.

The red man put down the bow, picked up the fire stick and became the best warrior in the forest. Yes. It is the only way.

It was a war party. It means they're on the attack up and down the frontier.

Sir!... Might I inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort.

Only twelve miles away! He could be here day after tomorrow.  Find your man, sir! Captain Beams will give you the message.

And who empowered these provincials to pass judgment upon England's policies in her own colonies? To come and go without so much as a "by your leave."

General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our mission is to fight.

Fire!

British promises are honored. And the militia will not be released. Because I need more definite proof than this man's word!

This interview's over! The militia stays!

My master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the English squatters. They have consented to go. So now he calls them enemies no longer.

That Le Renard has the power to lead his people into the light, I know well.

Perhaps the General's glasses can reach to the Hudson and he knows the size and imminence of the army of Webb...?

They may leave the fortress fully armed, but with no ammunition... Other than that, ask what you wish.

It was when it counted a couple of million years ago when the seas came in and drove us into the water.  Most homo sapiens didn't make it...Danakil man... <u>adapted</u>.

But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?

He don't need a readout, man, he needs help!

The good doctor hasn't showed yet.

Uh, oh...I see where this is going...

What dead one on the ship?

You screw around like that again and--

After a month of it you'd think I'd be used to it.

Mr. Beck, the contract states that no body can be disposed of without authorization of---

Don't thank me, yet, but it is important to know where you're going and who your friends are... 'Know what I mean?

What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.

Do it.

Twelve hours, no big deal.  We should know something first thing in the morning.  Don't worry.

I realize you must have gone through hell--

Timex...

It wouldn't make any difference in there...He could be two feet away and on fire and she'd still not see him!

Russian.

Russian, French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, German, a little Hindu, some Serbo Croat and a smattering of Swahili...standard pre-med background...

It's Hazy...It's got him! Stay here and don't let him out.  I'm going to get the Doc.

This is what I wear at the beach, goddamnit.

What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana...

He's tanking on us...

Twelve hours!

What are you going to do to him?

I've got Cobbie downstairs watching the door.

"Debbie Does Dallas"...  Hell, it's in Russian.  I can't read it...

Honey, the company don't give a flying fuck about "whys," they just look at the numbers and the contract says if we miss our quota they only got to pay us half-pay for the entire month.

The good doctor signed our death warrant.

The air's stopped.

She's wondering what's happening.  We're losing air faster than I thought.

How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.

Answer them and quit kicking me!

Your pocket?

Sorry, darling...Just thought a little humor would loosen us all up...you know?...

Stop fucking around, Tom, and think. What are we going to do?

Probably no longer than four weeks.

A traffic warden. Look, what's this?

Well, talk.

That inspires confidence, that does.

Think about what you're going to say, Ed; we are on thin ice.

A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.

You get the guns?

No Harry, you can't.

Er, yeah, sure, I'll have 'em.

It looks like ít, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.

Jesus Christ!

Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?

About twenty minutes.

Try that one.

Sure is.

I got the money to pay for 'em.

This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there.

There is only three of us here.

If you think I am going to war without one, you're mistaken, mate.

Listen, if he has the guns he might have the money . . . I think we should go and see him.

What do you mean?

Bacon, the fat man and myself, and it's time to make a call to Harry.

Top of the list of priorities, how nice they look.

. . . What?

Yup, you must be Harry? Sorry, I didn't know your father.

Yes . . . and is there something else you want to say? EDDY

Well, you're going to have a problem carrying on, aintcha.

And still got a sense of humour. That's not monkey nuts son; you can still fold.  OK, before I loan you this, I expect, if you lose of course, my money back within a week, Crystal? That's Sunday, OK?

I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank.

So?

Cupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you Tom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a grocer's.

It's the mother of fuck-ups, stupid!

Nick the Greek.

I would take a pain in the arse for half a million.

Tom, the fatter you get, the sadder you get.

Six.

We need fertilizer, Winston.

So?

You'll find out when I get you home. Thanks, Sam.

I can't take any more school.

I can fix cars.

Oh, come on--you and Grandma think anybody who works with their hands is a peasant. When Dad--

Two years at hard labor, Our Lady of Perpetual Help.

I do, sir.

From back in Houston. We both come up on Fifth Street.

He's going to lose a lung. This is not good news for Athena--

If I had I wouldn't have gone in.

I know that, Sergeant. We were just dancing. There was a bunch of us there. Shadow just come down looking for trouble.

I'm feeling okay--

Yes, Sergeant.

Yeah, this is Skinny.

That badge--

Skull was intact, no soft tissue left--not much to go on.

Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, most of 'em relatives. People breed like chickens.

Daddy hired a pinhead to take your job. He says so himself. Says "Even my son-in-law was better than this pinhead I got now".

No, it wasn't, was it? You didn't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul, did you?

I think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest. A spotter.

You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you.

I been here with him eight years now. He built it when he was with Leora.

Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--

Otis stood on good terms with the man. Whenever you do something makes the news, he sends it on. When they made you General, Otis just about drove away all our customers going on about it.

Yeah, I know--Man made me memorize the whole damn Army chain of command before he'd marry me. So this is a big deal, commander and  all?

Otis went on like you were that guy who won the Gulf War. Colin whatsit.

He never asked her.

The Trail of Tears.

No sports if I don't keep a B average, no TV on school nights, no PDA's--

By blood you are. But blood only means what you let it.

You own this place?

I don't know why I'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head.

It's not just cactus.  There's the nopals, the yuccas--

I think it's beyond what you'd call dating.

Maybe.

If I stayed out past ten with the guys she'd go into her Madame Butterfly routine--

She's pulled herself out of a pretty rough neighborhood.

You know who it was they dug up?

That ring--

Old bullets.  He uhm-- makes art with them.

Have we had trouble there before?

Hobby of mine. Got some artifacts, couple pieces one of your men out at the base made. Free admission.

We have an enlisted man's club at the post.

And people make their choice--

No hay de que. Tengo otra. [No problem, I've got another.]

I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road.

This same person been bragging all over the county how he don't have to cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it-- he can run his own operation 'thout any help. Como se llama, amigo?

Mercedes Gonzales Ruiz.

En ingles Enrique. This is the United States. We speak English.

I have some friends who have had a accident--

You think you're doing these people a favor? What are they going to do? Either they get on welfare or they become criminals--

Es mi novia. [She's my girlfriend.]

We have a daughter.

Donde vamos? [Where are we going?]

Buddy Deeds. He had a way.

Better late than never. Korean War hero, Sheriff for near thirty years-- Buddy Deeds Memorial P--

Hell, everybody heard that story a million times.

Seems like we have another one every week.

We don't need a new jail.

She put it even at three to three, so as the Mayor I get to cast the tiebreaker. The older generation won't have any problem with it. They remember how Buddy come to be Sheriff, that it was all 'cause he took their part.

Right.

I wish I could tell you I remembered something new, but I can't.

Do you?

I got to go see somebody in San Antonio today. Your memory gets any better, I'll be back tonight.

Danny's gonna be out for blood the next time.

I'd like to see them spend a day pulling 14-year-olds off of each other--I should get combat pay--

And when my father was Sheriff?

What was your deal with him?

Hollis probably told you we found Charley Wade.

It's Saturday.

Yeah. I had uhm--school business.

Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma.

I only went for my last two years.

They've got my Amado.

Yeah.

You've got your mother, your kids--

More, I hope.

Pilar--

They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.

You'd do a good job.

You don't need to cuff me.

Hell of a spot to put a business.

So when did Buddy leave?

Another woman?

Name's Otis.

Uh-huh.

I know that.

Knew what?

D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour.

All right.  It was...

He won't.

So tell me where Nix is buried.

You'll do more.than that.

And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?

What is he?

Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared...

Did your husband know Quaid?

And you don't ask questions?

He's an illusionist.  It's not exactly brain surgery.

Harry.

Sure.

I went up to the Magic Castle. You were right.  He didn't have a lot of fans up there.

Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't know the name.

Yes.  You do that.

I didn't leave.  I was just digging around.

He could get into people's heads. Make them see things. Terrible things.  And he could levitate. Juggle fire.

No.

No it isn't.  You can't help me.

Nothing?

It's okay.

Hang on!

Harry...

Yes.

I... have... to.

Somebody killed him.

He got up and walked.

What about Swann's miracles?

Fuck you.

I need to speak to you, Mr. D'Amour.  About last night.

I don't think the dead much care.

Swann's wife.

Looking for you.  I tried the hotel.

You're a detective, with no clues. Where else are you going to look? I'm going to keep this brief.  Here's thirty thousand dollars.

Why people die?  Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.

I'm afraid she's not in.

Shut up!

Why don't you leave this alone? Let everybody think it's over?

We've got to get you to a hospital.

Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.

Does anybody?

Too late.  Why are you here? Did you cone... up here for a reading?

What?

What a tragedy.  It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business.

I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.

For what?

You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.

It's me betrayed him.

Looks that way.

You don't get it, do you? We're shit. D'Amour.

At a guess... they just resurrected him.

What?

No!

Binding you.

Not true.

You'll do it?

You're probably just having a mid- life crisis. Did you buy a Porche?

25 years... that's a long time... Are you still in love with your wife?

Who do I have to fuck to get off this planet?

Ok.

But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.

I don't know. My fax said "have a good fright".

I got a fax today from your friend Hiromix.

No, yes, it does...

Thanks. It does, the more you know who you are... you don't care about things the same way...

Because that would be too easy.

Oh, she'll love it.

Yeah, look at that thing.

No, we'll find something around here.

You're a brat, wasn't there anyone else around to lavish you with attention?

That lunch was the worst, huh.

That's what you said the other night.

I don't know, it just doesn't, reality changes things....we can't stay here forever, unless maybe we started a Jazz band.

Hi, Bob.

Yes?

Hello, darling.

Oh, yeah? I wish I had seen it.

Well, that's good, I have to get the kids off for school.  Can I call you in a little while?

Bob?

That's ok.

Ok.

Excuse me?

Ok. Maybe I'll walk down with you.

What?

I gotta go to work.

Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.

Ok, definitely call them, I'll be back Friday. I love you.

It's probably trivial.

Hmmm.

I can't believe Will killed him.

You need to believe in something besides yourself.

I found the pentacle.

So you're going to kill her?  Put the gun down Claire.

And on the day of the murders, his state of mind?

Tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and Mr. Viznick.

I'm gonna go make a stink.  Sit tight. I'll make sure you get a change of clothes.

I think I should join you.

You weren't there.  Give me time to get some proof.

Father, I have nowhere else to stay.

Everything I did, I did for you.  I love you, Peter.  Think of it.  I'm giving you a gift, absolute power and knowledge.

Well, in my prayers, I realized we've been fooling ourselves and probably... blown this all out of proportion.  God would never allow anything like that to happen.

Yes.  We won, that's right.

Um hm.  That's right, Maya.

How many weeks are you honey/

What's his name?

...as a narcissist, he couldn't blame himself.  He created the voices after the fact.

And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist.

Do you remember Henry Birdson?  The math professor who won the Salwen Medal, then went home and killed his family?

That's their explanation.  You might not believe me...

The good outwitting the bad.  It's like Birdson had a split personality.

You're already contaminated.  It's why you couldn't hear the tape.  There's probably a pentacle near your bed.  To sanctify you.

The only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at Bedford.

Your 33rd birthday.  The transformation will be a perversion of Christ's rising from the dead.  Townsend discovered it in one of Lareaux's books.

I know it is.  Right after my parents died, I went to the beach...  I was in the water.  Everything was calm.  And then one of those really big waves hit me.  Hard.  Pulled me straight to the bottom.  I struggled and finally ran out of air.  If it hadn't been for my sister who pulled me out, I would've drowned. Legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me.

Only your body will remain.  I believe your soul will be at peace.  If we kill you, Satan can't stay.

Terrific.

You are the younger of two...

What about that psychic, what's his name, Szabo?

We millionaires yet?

Thanks for having me, Sally.

Well, long-term exposure to things like this tends to give you a sort of clinical understanding of the subject. After awhile, you begin to make friends with it, so to speak.

No, the less mystifying.  Good and evil are only illusions.  There is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."  That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings.

Right.  If you believe in God.  As a narcissist, Viznick couldn't blame himself for the alleged murders.  He created the voices after the fact.  In order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides George Viznick and that George Viznick needs to pay.

Of course.

Really?  You know, seeing these guys away from the court, the facade slips. You catch things.

Yeah, look at that sweet face.  You'd never guess he killed nine people.  I'm gonna get my smokes.  Be right back.

I'll quit, maybe you should start.

Sure thing.  Look, I've got enough, between your preliminary statements and all the witness accounts.  You can go home.  Gimme til morning.  Find out who he is. Until then, don't sweat it, huh?  Just your random bad cheese trying to hole you.

Hey, don't thank me.  Somebody up there likes you.

Sure.  In between all the other things I have to do.

Oh, yes.  The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife.

She's alright.

The blue.

You love to pose so much, let's see it again.

You're cold?

Don't go starting rumors, Jim.  My son's college bound with or without basketball.

Kyra, this is Monica.  She, uh...

Four days.

Why not?

You're just scared.  I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be.  I believe in you.  You just have to get back on the court.  Like you'd get back on a horse.

Found?  I'm not some charity case.

Yeah, right.

Hey.  You just worry about playing your behind off for that recruiter tonight. Let me worry about your date.

What?

The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.

Hey, don't take it personal.  And don't think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other.  We're teammates, okay?

Just one word of advice for next season.

How do you say "you're dreaming" in Italian?

Just like that?

Sometimes.  But what's the alternative, not playing?  You remember big Toni?  She quit last year, now she's working at some bookstore.  I mean, look at us. They treat us like we're Hollywood stars over here.  We just played in the championship game.  It doesn't get much sweeter than this.

Lucky.

My Mom says she doesn't know where I come from 'cause I act different.

One time Magic scored forty-eight points, and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth.

I don't care.

I'd just tell my sister, Lena.

Oh.

So that means I have to ride with you.

Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.

And?  She's not saying, "I think you're a nice guy and I wanna get to know you better," she's saying, "I wanna bone."

I don't.

It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just...?

Yeah.

Fine, Quincy.

Quit.

Who cares if you're never known as the first girl in the NBA.  You'll get more play behind Quincy McCall's woman anyway.

Why not?

Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.

Talk to your new girlfriend.

I never asked you to choose.

I'm a ballplayer.  If anyone knows what that means it should be you.

Look, I'm entering the draft.

Uh huh.

A lot of things.  All I know is I'll be back in six months.

Not for Quincy McCall.

Kiss my ass.

Oh yeah?

What do you mean?

A rest?

Darryl.  He's alright, kinda corny.

Yeah.  Two weeks.  I didn't get to send you an invitation, but if you...

Maybe go back to school.

Find.

What?

I know, I probably should have said it two weeks ago.

What?

For what?

Well, can you give him this for me?

I don't wanna look fast.  Thanks, girl.

What?  Oh, and, uh, don't say "shit."

I came second to the NBA.  I'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job.

Nona, please.

We still have to go?

Okay.

I mean, how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho's?

So you're gonna take the word of some trick over Pop's?  He wouldn't lie.

What mess?

Tell me what?

No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say it.  It's not true.

I want this thing to go to court, but my lawyer's telling me to settle.

Ok. Janet you have Phil Parma --

There's no number for Frank in any of Earl's stuff and he's pretty out of it -- I mean, like I said, he's dying, y'know.  Dying of Cancer.

It's rough.  I'm sorry, did she make it?

Oh that's good.

Thank you.  Thank you very much.

...I want to....I want so many things, Claudia. Maybe we can just talk to straighten our things out....there are so many things that I want to tell you --

Ok.  Claudia Wilson: You tryin' to go deaf?

And that could be the sign of a damaged ear drum, you understand?

-- do you wanna cup?

Oh, it'll be fine, I'm sure, Claudia.

Good bye.

What is it?  Did you forget something?

Well...is that illegal?

Oh, see?  This is great.  Ten o'clock.

Bye.

...yeah...

That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do.

I'm really nervous that you're gonna hate me soon.  That you're gonna find stuff out about me and you're gonna hate me --

You're a police officer.  You have so much, so many good things and you seem so together...so all straight and put together without problems.

Wanna kiss me, Jim?

I won't say, no, wait, Claudia --

Yes.

Claudia.

It's upstairs.

I can check on that for you, maybe we can take a tour --

If he hadn't pissed his pants, we woulda won.  We fucking had this game.

Stay quiet...stay quiet, son --

I'm not mad, son, I will not be mad at you and it's ok and please put it down and I won't be mad and I won't --

That's confidential information, little man.

No.

This sounds threatening.

Well --

A very chatty-kind, you do, indeed, it seems.

Nothing special, just a spoke in the wheel.

Might of been before my time.

I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.

"The" cause of dullness in others --

-- and lemme tell you this: Samuel Johnson never had his life shit on and taken from him and his money stolen -- who took his life and his money?  His parents? His mommy and daddy?  Make him live this life like this -- "A man of genius" gets shit on as a child and that scars and it hurts and have you ever been hit by lighting? It hurts and it doesn't happen to everyone, it's an electrical charge that finds it's way across the universe and lands in your body and your head -- and as for "ruined but by himself," not if his parents take his friggin' life and his money and tell you to do this and do that and if you don't? well, what --

I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.

Why don't you run along now friend, your dessert is getting cold.

Gently, son --

Don't Donnie. Don't do it.

Phil's one of the nurses from the service?

Ok. Linda:  Earl is not gonna make it. He's dying. He is.  He is dying very, very rapidly --

You do?

She loves you.

-- memory?

I've seen it before.

Is Jack your son?

-- it's not him. it's not him. He's the fuckin' asshole...Phil..c'mere...

No.

Hi.  Is Frank there?

Alright.  Thank you.

Let's talk about --

So boring, so useless --

Around here.

Hollywood, mainly.

From '84 to '89.

...are you Phil...?

I got your message.  That you were trying to get me -- right?

Yeah let's...maybe just stand.

Um...soon tonight...I think, yes? Tommorrow...I mean...very soon...very...

Yeah.

Mmm.

yeah.

Then you've got nothin' to worry about.

Don't test me, you wanna talk about what the law book says, we can do that, push me far enough and I'll take you to jail -- now calm down.

No you don't: But I'm gonna ask you one more time: Are you alone in here?

OK.  That's true.  Is anyone else, besides me and besides you in this house?

Are you lyin' to me?

I'm not askin', Marcie.

I went out last night.

It's a free country, you can think anything you want.

No.

THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM, STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.

Did your wife find out?

If she asks me any question I want to tell her.  I want to tell her everything I've done.

I got in trouble at school.

Find her, get her and tell her I want to talk to her, Mary.  Fucking hell.

It's okay, Stanley. It's alright.

I'm drinking.

I don't know.  I have to go, I don't have time and I have more drinking to do before I go march --

No, I mean:  I'm telling you this, now. You see?  You see I want to make everything clear and clean...and apologize for me....for all the stupid things I've done....that will eat me up....

Do you feel better now that you've said this?

Did you ever touch her?

I really don't know.

I don't know what I've done.

Hello.  Is Claudia here?

I'm her father.

No.

What's MOW?

If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? Attornery-client, you understand?

Like a shrink, like if I go to see a shrink, I'm protected, I can say things -- fuck -- I don't know what I'm doing --

Adultery isn't illegal -- it's not something that can be used in a court to discredit the will or -- Linda. Linda. Calm down.

You don't have to change the will, if what you want to do is get nothing you can renounce the will when it's time.

You need to sober up.

....it's alright....

...I don't....

818-753-0088.

Yeah.

Cigarettes. Camel Lights.

That's it.

Love you too.

You're late, not me.

Sure.

See you.

I'm fine. nothing.

I didn't know the answer --

I'm fine. I'm fine, I just wanna keep playing --

Yes.

Go to bed.

I have money to give you.

I understand you saved my son's life today.

I wish to discuss your brother.

He is your brother!

Next week.  This is a mere garden party -- and I wish to join it, so I will be brief.  I am experiencing resistance from the Jesuits.

Come, we have a boat waiting.

Tomorrow.

There is that, of course -- but mainly it is because I am so much smarter than everyone else.

Those can be adopted --

You grow fond of him.  That's good.

He's threatened to do it, it's been building up in him for months.

The mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected.  Do you notice?

Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance.

I know.  God go with you.

Everyone back.

I trained those men myself.  They will stand and fight.  But if we are to die, let it be this way.

Hell may be our destination, dear Porthos, but not this trip.

We will make our own luck tonight... if Phillippe holds up.

At a ball, everyone watches the King!

He lures us to capture.

Michelle, she -- The king has invited her to come live in the palace.

She cannot possibly refuse.  Her family is poor, they have even less money than we do.  And along with the invitation, the King sent the diamond pendant, from the piglet.

Athos, my friend!

Life is too long.  Except when we have our friends.  Look at you! You're still a boy!  Sit, sit!  I'll open a bottle of wine.

I was feeling sorry for myself. Raoul is getting married, he proposed today!  I love that boy beyond all measure, I've spent everything I own to give him education and opportunity.  Now he has complete happiness, and I mope.

To kill the king.

I did not share beauty with someone... who is no longer here for me to share beauty with.

I will sit with you.  I can't sleep either.

No!  Do not be sorry!  Never be sorry!  The King cares for nothing and for no one!  There are no mistakes when you are King!  What you do is right for every person!  A King has contempt for everyone!

Just... water.

Who came?

I decided it this morning.

I am King, d'Artagnan.  I will change my mind as I wish, and I will enjoy my banquet as I wish!

It is not Raoul's heart alone that concerns me.  It is yours.  I know you find women compliant -- especially the poorer ones like Michelle.  But do they love you?  Do you love them?  What about a queen to love?  A son of your own?

Not criticize -- plead.  Love.  Love your people, and you will not bear to see them hungry.  Love women, and they will love you.  Love yourself, and --

Yes, your Majesty.

Eh?

No.  He cut an ear from one of the men, no one else was hurt.  Captain d'Artagnan allowed him to leave. Athos was upset about the death of his son, at the front.

Sire, I --

A letter.  May I see?

You would do that, your Majesty?

Yeah?..well what are you getting at? You saying he has an agenda down here?

If what you're saying is true, then why would he have killed two police officers? A man like that would want to lay low, if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission!

Or worse, we'll have a hostage situation on our hands.

Yeah, stick around, you might learn something.

But what was a hair dresser from Malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?

Right behind you.

These crowds are going to make it a bitch!

It's just...catching up with me, you know?

It wasn't in the cards.

And what did he do to the girl?

Could explain why Fleming was there.

They found the getaway Mercedes a parking garage north of Venice. It checks out.

Up north.

Seattle.

I didn't.  I figured you leave it well enough alone.

No.  A witness.

Jim Trudell!  Bravo company!

Well where are ya, what are ya, drunk?

It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere?

Please...

This is Tubbs. Sorry I can't answer the phone, I'm out square dancing. Leave a message--

How about Marvosa and the others?

A bank?

He doesn't think you run mind games on him.

You're never alone in a room with Graham, are you? You're smooth about it, but you're never one-on-one with him. Why's that? Do you think he's psychic?

That's when it happened?

If the Tooth Fairy listens to Lecktor, he'll come for me. So we're going to set me up as bait to draw him out. Give him a clean shot.  That's what you were thinking, isn't it?

That's probably in the part Lecktor tore out.  At the top it says: 'I hope we can correspond.' And then the hole begins.  It looks like Lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away.

It has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell.

Twenty minutes max.

Will Graham, Jack Crawford...

Because it's his bad luck to be special.

What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.'  Confessions?

The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago...

What do you want to do?

Say we've arrested a good suspect. You walk in and see him. What is there about him that doesn't surprise you?

What's one way?

We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack.  What's the other?

What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?

That's narrow?

It's a foregone conclusion. For Christ's sake, it's eleven PM.  The full moon is tonight.

Is there a label on the Jacobi can that says what lab processed it?

I want a chopper on the roof in three minutes. To Meigs Field.  At Meigs have them warn up and flight- prep the Gulf Stream.

Stay in the trees.

Put your back against the door. Come forward three steps until you feel the tile on your feet and there will be a stool just to your left.

In eight days.

Uh-huh.

Francis? Where are you?

Are you okay...?

You'll come by?

It's me.

Atoning, Mr. Lounds.

Yes...

Yes.

Yes.

God, no.

You'll let me go now?

No.

Hi, Linda. ..

Maybe you can help me. This is Bob Greer of Blaine & Edwards Publishing Company. Dr. Bloom asked me to send a copy of 'The Psychiatrist and the Law' to someone. Linda never sent me the address and phone number.

Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too

Thank you very much.

Most people are.

Describe exactly what you think he did to Mrs. Leeds and I'll tell you if you're right or not.

The report didn't mention nails and eyes.

He only bit women so far, right?

What did he want?

We have it good, don't we?

What you've already decided. You're not really asking.

Huh?  Will? Is that you?

Hey, baby! Where are you?

Eating junk food.  They don't have a lock on anything, Molly. There's not enough information. Or I haven't done enough with it...

Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit-brown for all I care...  Look, I'm sorry. When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and...

I have to go back to Birmingham.

No. I have to be in there...  alone. Maybe there's something for me if I know how he feels and thinks.

Will...

I was out in the garden. Mama came out and told me when she saw it on TV. Why didn't you call me?

Will, they never get to see Kevin and a few more days...

Will?  You could come up here.

That's not true.

You got a deal...

You going back down to Florida after?

I'll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone.

Go on to the house.

Stuart is fine.

You've read the transcript. It's all there.

It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?

There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?

I want your opinion.

Pretty well.

You got it.

Tank you veddy much.

I'm not a comedian.  I have no talent.  I'm a song-and-dance man.

What's up?

The ONLY reason I did Taxi was so I could have my own Special!

Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up there?

There'll be other shots.

No, I'm not gonna take it.  If I take it I'll break my back.

I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show.  The best show anybody's ever seen!

So who's gonna pay for it?

You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money.

Yeah...

Yeah!  He's a psychic surgeon in the Philippines, and he's amazing!  He rubs you and sucks the disease right out!

Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing.  It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in.

Twenty!

Oh.  So you were just pretending to be an asshole.

No thanks.

I'm here, ain't I?

If you want...

I can shtop whenever I want...

Okay.  You're probably right.

You're a wimp.

Oh George, this is Bob Zmuda.  Bob and I have been buddies for years.

What?!?

No!  Andy, don't do it --

She'll say, "Now my son is a man."

What is this, World War Two...?

No offense, pal, but I just don't think you're built for it.  These he- men'll kick your ass!!  They're huge!

Why??  I... I attend every year.

Are you sure?

I'll take my chances!!

Why's that?  You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman --

Andy, I'm calling you up like this because I have the utmost respect for your artistry.  But -- I need your permission to fire him.

I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --

Isn't Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon?  Maybe that'll chill him out.

Wow, you can't BUY this kind of publicity!

FORGET IT.  It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this.

They're gonna lynch him!

Expect it.  Did you get anything from the room?

It's already begun.

Know what?

You all look the same to me.

Oh shit.

What?

It's Choi.

Right...

All the time.  It's called mescaline and it is the only way to fly.

We're going to kill him.  Do you understand that?  He's going to die just like the others.

If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus.

Don't hate me, Trinity.  I'm just the messenger.  And right now I'm going to prove it to you.

What happened to them?

How?

Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie. An old appliance store.

They'll be able to track it.

Hello, Neo.  Do you know who this is?

I can guide you out, but you have to do exactly what I say.

There's a small ledge.  It's a short climb.  You can make it.

It's an honor.

More important than what is when?

You believe the year is 1997 when in fact it is much closer to 2197.  I can't say for certain what year it is because we honestly do not know.

Because... I didn't think I would?

I think I do.

Yeah.

No, Neo.  I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to.

What's going on?

Yes.  She's very old.  She's been with us since the beginning.

She would say she knows enough.

Don't think of it in terms of right and wrong.  She is a guide, Neo. She can help you find the path.

Goddamn!  It's good to hear your voice, sir!

Yes, sir.

Bingo.  Not quite what you were expecting, right?  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip.  Almost done.  Smell good, don't they?

I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  And don't worry about the vase.

What?

How do you know that name?

Please.  Just listen.  I know why you're here, Neo.  I know why you left your family and your friends, why you left your home to come to this city.  You're looking for him.

Yes.

It might have been.  I'm not sure.

Is Morpheus still alive, Tank?

What choice?

Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.

I believe I can bring him back.

No?  Let me tell you what I believe. I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.  I believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since I am the ranking officer on this ship, if you don't like it then I believe that you can go to hell, because you aren't going anywhere else.

No.

Deep underground.  Near the earth's core, where it's still warm.  You live long enough, you might even see it.

I know that's what it looks like, but it's not.  I can't logically explain to you why it's not. Morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed.  I understand that now. That's why I have to go.

Mr. Wizard, get me the fuck out of here!

Tank, I need a pilot program for a military M-109 helicopter.

Look fella...this is private...

All right!  Quiet!  For $40 I could give you...

Uh...can we give you a check?

'Take a little tip from Mack the Knife...'

Jewish...

Hide the gun.  Throw it away. Anything.  Listen, I gotta borrow your car...I think we should take a ride...away from here for the night...you know what I mean?

So I'll send you a postcard from wherever.  If I get there.

No.

Sure.  And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right.

Not quite...but keep trying.

I bet 235.  Because I dreamt of my grandfather - and when he died, the number of the funeral parlour was 235 - so when I dreamt...

Johnny, you're a real jerk-off.

Cut it out stupid.  It's me.

That's not going to help.

Big deal...in the meantime, it's done...I'll still try to help you out...You know that...but you gotta show some effort...some respect... understand?

Don't be smart.

What you're doing for me isn't worth it...believe me!

I'll be here.  Don't worry.

Mind your own business.

What pipes?

I don't understand, where's Groppi?

For these prices don't be particular. That's all they had - but next week we'll see...

$3,000.  Shit!  Can we hold it at $3,000?

You're not going to use that gun, Johnny.

That's nice.

Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly.

Fine.  Did you have a good time last night?

Ok.

Oh...around...why?

Our friend, Groppi, went to his mother's house.  And when he was there...at night...

Teresa.

What do they expect you to say?

Well...

It's all right.

Charlie...?

What is it now?

No...we can come back in a couple of weeks.  Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right.

Charlie...I've got to see you.  I want to talk...

But...

Count it.

Yeah, so things'll be even.

No...no.  Nooo...it's just that I...I...uh... this ain't my car.

You what?

Sure.

You think so?

Haven't you had enough of us, Dad?

He's coming.

Yeah, Bill, the suspense is killing me.

Love that name.

Not much more.  Big day in the big city.  What's on your mind?

Allison, I trust you.  This is your thing.

Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.

We've got some things to discuss.

Who?

Yeah?  And what about my enemies?

That you've been to Susan?

Yes, it is.

He said he would be there with bells on.

No jocks?  A twenty-game winner or a Masters champion?  Someone I could talk to.  Or would talk to me.

Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen.

Pinot Grigio.  We're considering it for the appetizer.

Both.

I'm sorry, I don't recall --

Daddy'll do fine.  Besides, he's got Joe.  And so do you.

That may be.  But I don't like the fucker.  I don't like the way he looks at you and talks to you.  And vice versa.

What an odd pairing.

Then why did you bring it up?

But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.

What'd it say?

Sounds good.

Like a marriage made in heaven?

What?!

As much as Joe's?

If I read this Board right now, they want you to accept Bontecou's offer.

Bontecou wants a quick response and --

Proof?  We've got plenty of proof.

Are you?

Go right ahead.  Tell William Parrish how you betrayed him at a secret Board meeting.  And tell Allison how you got her father fired -- and he lost his company.

He had no choice.  You're a formidable adversary.

I from dat nex' place.

Rass!

It's so very nice to see you again.

And you're a nice man, Quince.

Love.

How did you meet?

'The deepest, darkest secrets --'?

No.

Peanut butter.

Goodnight to you, Susan.

I don't have any time to see you now.  I'm doing grand rounds and then I'm examining back-to-back patients until dinner and then --

And I appreciate you, too.

I am, too.

Yes.  I'm tired.

How beautiful.

I loved it.

Oh, I hope a long, long time.

I love you in an evening gown.

Don't.  That will come later.

It's a saying.

-- That was the place... and you were the guy.

You want me to wait for you, you'll be back --

But you're not.  You're somewhere else.  You're someone else --

I won't.

You're putting me on the spot, Bill.

Your doctor?  Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta?  Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain?  Were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in Gstaad?

Yes?

So can I.

I don't understand.

Glad you like it.  My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches.  Joan -- that was my wife --

Cold lamb sandwiches -- not as chewy as roast beef, not as boring as chicken.  She knew stuff like that.

Why didn't you stop me?

I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be.  A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it.  And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. Okay?

I don't know.

I guess...

Well, you goddam well should.  You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter.

I told you, 'watch it'.

Yes?

Yeah.

Well, they're mine now.

I certainly hope so -- I loved Susan from the moment she was born, and I love her now, and every minute in between, and what I dream of is a man who will discover her and she will discover a man who will love her, who is worthy of her, who is of this world, of this time and has the grace and compassion and fortitude to walk beside her as she makes her way through this beautiful thing called life.

Thank you.

That's life.  What can I tell you?

Of course.

Then don't.

I don't!

Show me around.  Be my guide.  And in return, you get...

Watch it!

Yes, Bill.  The question.

Next week?

Joe, you don't know how glad I am you're aboard.  Anybody who can take some of the weight off the old man, I'm in his corner.

Yeah, I give a shit.

Sure.

Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit.

You like him, don't you?

What were you going to say?

So what's wrong with that?

You're not listening --

He doesn't care.  But thanks anyway.

Incidentally, 'Joe' what?

Cut it out, Susan.  You and I've got to talk.  Big day tomorrow, everybody.  Joe, let's go.

Yeah, it's good to get together.

I don't know.

Where's he going?

Yes, but --

I want you to know how much I love you.  That you've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me.

I was just being agreeable, now I've got to explain why?

-- This is my lucky day.  I arrive in this big bad city and I not only find a doctor, a beautiful woman as well.

Did I say something wrong?

This has nothing to do with you. You helped me out, and I'm grateful.

Sense of humour went with the memory, huh? You know why you're still here, don't you?

From what?

I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone.

That's the thing. I have this condition.

I have no memory.

That must suck. All... backwards.				 *

Why?

Leonard.

That's right I did, didn't I?

I don't want blood on them.

So you have information for me?

No. But the photo on his license looked familiar. I think he's been in the bar before

Yes.

Kill him.

What happened?

And what did he say?

He'll kill you, Lenny.

He was beating the crap out of me! I had to tell him something!

I have this condition -

Help me.

About your whore of a wife?

Why not?

What do you want?

Who's your boyfriend?

Did Teddy send you?

You have no idea where you've just come from? What you've just done?

Then why are you here?

I want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds, and tell me if you really think that Sammy is faking his condition.

That's who you were, you don't know who you are.

You're in a playful mood.

You said you were leaving town.

Yeah, yeah. I heard enough about him. Tell me about John G. You still think he's here, right?

Well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong guy.

No! Should I?

Sammy. Remember Sammy. You told me about Sammy.

Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you?

The sort of questions you should be asking yourself.

The Jaguar's out front. You didn't even Bother to put it around back.

He knows you're no good on the phone, so		    * he calls you up to bullshit you.				  * Sometimes you stop taking his calls, so			* he slips something under your door to			  * frighten you into answering your phone			 * again. He's been pretending to help you.		    * Feeding you a line of crap about John G.		    * being some local drug dealer.					*

I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town looking for information. The local boys put us in touch.

No. Don't worry, I'm a cop. Everything'll be okay. Is he still breathing?

Well, I hope it's not as serious as his, 'cos this guy's dead.

That's Sammy, not me! I told you about Sammy -

Sammy let his wife kill herself! Sammy ended up in an institution - !				    *

I never said he was faking! I never said that!

Sammy didn't have a wife.

Are you sure?

Why do you keep lying to me?					 *

To set yourself a puzzle you won't ever solve. You know how many towns, how many		    * guys called James G? Or John G? Shit, Leonard, I'm a John G.

My mother calls me Teddy. I'm John Edward Gammell. Cheer up, there's a lot of John		    * G's for us to find. All you do is moan.			* I'm the one that has to live with what			 * you've done. I'm the one that has to put		    * it all together. You just wander around			* playing detective. You're living a dream,		   * kid. A dead wife to pine for and a sense		    * of purpose to your life. A romantic quest		   * which you wouldn't end even if I wasn't			* in the picture.							    *

This bad cop. He checked you into the			  * Discount Inn. Then he's been calling you		    * for days, sticking envelopes under your			* door, telling you shit.						 *

His name's James F. Grantz, John G. Check		   * your tattoos.							 *

Doing...?

"And" what?

You can't.

You said Nazi Low-riders...?

Okay.  You got the "item"?

Two main players plus three.

25% discount on the load.

Really?  So, what is this, a party?

Right now.

Nothing.  As in "free, gratis."

And what is that?

Cost less.  That's the point.

Better than that.  We become partners.  Only in this territory and only on loads we run. And you don't pay us three thousand a ki.  You pay us zero.  Why we get is thirty percent of the load. Product or cash.  "And why," you're thinking, "would I be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that? Is he chipping?  Crazy for my love? Too many mojitas?"  And the answer is, "of course" but also "no.  It is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can."

Zero risk.

Who you run loads for?  Cause other than Nicholas, you knows you?

I am not John Wayne.  There is no "S" on his chest.  We get down if the play calls for it.  But we are into business and making money.

Port-Au-Prince.

Hit a couple of jazz clubs.  Fell back to her place.

Verdado.

Do you <u>believe</u>...I have forgotten I am a cop?

Alonzo?  What are you talking about?  Where are you...?

He's talking to you, bro.  What he means to say is he is reluctant to abandon the penetration of a major narcotrafficking organization...

Good idea.  We'll grab a bite.

Not French registry?

A good deal, like this with us, for Burnett will be good only temporarily.  He'll get restless because he believes nothing is forever.  Life is dust, make it while you can.  He's ambitious.

What would you do...?

Define small.

Meaning...?

Slow and low, Adam A-500s...  ...carbon composite, stealthy, 1400 nautical-mile range, thousand ki payload...all the way to Caravels and 727's from a source country to a transshipment point.  Small freighters.  We've done containers...

Nothing.  'Cause how you do delivery on the beach, I don't like.  Maybe this does not work.

You work that out with La Senora.  You will get sixteen fuel bladders of crystal meth precursors from the Malaysian ship.  For collection in North Miami.  You warehouse it. Release it when we say.  I'm sure you have friends with fast boats...

You're hoping to get a look at what?

Said, a person's gotta make a living.

You sure are a pretty lady.

No. Of course not. Just something struck me funny...

You gonna beat me, Joe?

Oh, it ain't cheap. I mean, yeah, I'd say this was an all right shirt. Don't like to, uh, you know, have a lot of cheap stuff on my back.

How would I know? You gotta tell a person these things  A hustler? Picking up trade on the street like that -- baby, believe me -- you need management.

Well, Joe, you're a nice guy, and I'd be doing you both a favor, but why? What'm I dragging my bum leg all over town for? It's no picnic and what for, for me myself, what?

Shee-it, man, I can't say all that.

This is an okay setup you got here, but I'd say you ain't just exactly, uh, flush, is that right or not?

What's all this sweet talk about Florida? Your friend O'Daniel got a stable down there now?

Well, uh, my manager's gonna manage all that crap, or else he gonna get a coconut up his flue.

You like it? Take a look.

The coat? A guy I did a favor once gave it to me. Christ.

Twenty bucks...

No. But while you was buying the underwear, I could have lifted the socks.

They gotta be.

How'n hell a dumb Bronx kid like you know that?

Oh, difficult, it's so difficult. You're a nice person, Joe -- I should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. Oh, how I loathe life. I loathe it. Please go. Please.

No, yes. No, I mean yes please go. Help me to be good. Come back tomorrow. Promise.

No sir, I'm no cowboy really, but I'm a first class stud.

Well, not too, I mean, a little.

Well, uh, I'm raring to go.

No. You got it.

I agree. And for that service I charge one dollar taxi fare.

Getchmis...?

Little fuckers are thieves, rapists, pickpockets, murderers, you name it - they do it. Don't trust any of 'em...

The prison, man. There was this German cat an architect in the hospital. He was helping the Turks build some shit round the place. I laid some bread on him and he let me copy them.

Bad. She couldn't make the trip. You know Her boy...  Susan told us before we got your letter. She's fine; she's trying to get the money to come back and see you, but...

Dad...  I'll pay you back for all this, I Promise.

I know.

About ten kilometers.

Would you recognize him again?

I just needed some extra money.  I was broke, the guy offered me the hash and...

Something like that. Cigarette?

I'm Billy Hayes... At least I used to be.

Yeah.  That guy who beat me?  I feel stoned.

What did he do?

Twelve years.

Thank you.

What do you mean?

Two thirty.

Max... Your BILLY shirt's on fire...

Cut his fucking throat.

You know where it is?

Maybe he's changing jobs.

Cat, ah!  Ayip!

I make special tea for you, Hiyes, okay?  We've to live like brothers. We have to be in here together.

What's your name?

Did you hear me?  Get Dr. Raymond! NOW!!

Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...

I think so. One right, two lefts...

No, you talkin' at me.

"Mistake"?  What's that supposed to...?

Depends.  You got a memo?

Go!! Just go!!

Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.

What?

Across both tracks!!

Please.

Don't get kinky here...

I'll be late.

Maybe they lied to you.

Fuck 'em.  They don't know what they're missing.

You said that thing was big as your hand.  I don't think I'm going to miss...

No.

What-

Peter-

The scent won't last...

Your arm, you can't...

Gross. What is it?

Oh, Jesus.

No shit.

Anything you can tell me might help.

--my number one fan.

I didn't know it was going to be a big storm.

If you wouldn't mind.

Nothing.

Well, it's brilliantly written, but then everything you write is brilliant.

Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.

You'd be amazed at what some people will believe.

She's a fine... uh... pig is what she is...

I know how that can be.

Annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and Misery's spirit is still alive--

I DIDN'T...

Perfect.

Yes.

I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best.

I don't know.

Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.

I know you didn't mean it when you killed her, and now you'll make it right.

Don't worry about that. You'll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work.

C'mere, I'll show you.

I thought you'd be interested. I'd like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it's written.

I want my pills NOW!

--not fair?

The what?

My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef.

I don't know what you're talking about.

Why would I run away? I'm a writer, Annie--it's all I am--and I've never written this well--even you said that this is my best, didn't you?

It will.

You'll know very soon. I'm starting the last chapter. And when I finish, I want everything to be perfect. I'll require three things.

You'll know everything in a minute. Get the champagne.

Work, work, work.  Virginia? When was that blizzard?

Well, this deputy would rather be home under the covers with the Sheriff.

Hope not--if he is, he's dead. Let's go to the newspaper office.

There's two kinds of people that drive around in old cars: the ones that can't afford new ones, and the ones who wouldn't give 'em up for anything in the world. That second bunch don't drive around with twenty- five-year-old dents.

What is it?

Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?

I'm sure you're right.

Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff.  --Lest you call paper odd.

No, the typing kind.

You're still a writer.

Great.

Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house.

From her point of view or mine?

Well that depends.

I suppose I did.

'Thief in the Night?'

Not as much as you feel like hearing it.

I'll be damned.  It's McCloy, the Biocyte CEO.

And the check's in the mall.

Do what?

Indeed.

Your help?  What are you talking about?

They've got a book for everything.

Not revealing information doesn't necessarily make someone a liar.

You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..

And six billion in the world.

I'd like a little more conviction..

You've either got it or you don't.  Let your conscience be your guide?

Then feel better!..

Yes?

Just about..

Annex is strictly off limits to me and they never come to the main house, Michael even takes their meals to them all but shoves them under the door.

Why?  What's happened. What did you see?

Ethan, tell me -

Nyah, it's very important not do anything to alarm Ambrose..

No time to explain.  You've done well, and we're so close.  So close.  It's critical that you do whatever Ambrose asks.  Don't worry - it'll be over soon.. That's a promise.. Come on, now off you go!

I wasn't thinking!  Just..trying to keep you from getting hurt, that's all.

Then you'll have to kill me before it's too late.  Before I start killing people.

Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.

'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'

In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.

You mean it'll be difficult.

You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.

I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was a compliment.

In this case, it wasn't a bad idea.  In face, it was a pretty damn good idea. Just don't make a habit of it.  And, as for Ms. Hall, in light of her efforts, her criminal records will certainly be expunged.  I'm assuming you approve.

I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.

You keep calling me Dmitri.  You really shouldn't.

I'm fine..

Put in the coordinates and let's get a visual.  The visuals aren't coming up.

Nyah still on the property?

No garage entrance.  Lobby's protected by five guards on rotating patrol.

She's on the North Head Bluff - approaching the cliffs.  One klick away.

Do I?

By asking me.

His name is.....Dimitri Miediev.

Good idea.

All ten million.

Now we donít have to eliminate him?  You like that, donít you Claire?  Donít you?

What happened to Jim?

Take off your God damn coat!

Who is they, who is they?

I'm going to get it for him.  Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he'll find me.

You didn't have to.........

This stuff is so sticky.

Donít <u>think</u>, be <u>sure</u>.  Are you clean?

Location green.  One hour.  Iíll be there myself.

Yeah.  I follow you.

Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.

Let's see if you can follow me around this room.  The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team.  You're worried about me. <u>Why</u>?

This whole operation was a molehunt.

Kitteridge, you've never seen me very upset.

I see you've been out visiting the folks.

Whether you like a paradox.  I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt.

Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits.

I wouldn't dream of it.

Bank?

We're not outta here yet.

Higher.

What about my coat?  I'll freeze.

Why?

What the hell's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? Claire's in a weird mood too.

I don't know, I had to go to Chicago again.  You were in Kiev.  You tell me.

Wonderful.  Ran into a convention of auto dealers at the Drake Hotel.  You hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to Mars after two years?  His wife's got a year old kid.  So he says "All right.  Who was it?  My friend Harry?"  She says no. "Oh, it was my friend Sammy."  She says it wasn't Sammy.  "Oh, I suppose it was my friend Lou."  "No, what's the matter, don't you think I have any friends of my own?!"

No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? You think the plot'll work?

If you were me, Ethan, who would <u>you</u> trust to make him believable?

About two hundred yards from the bridge.

- and picked us up in the States -

I remember..

If I supposedly deliver the NOC list to Max, Max has agreed to deliver Job to me. Iíll have Claire and Luther Stickell with me on the train.  Marcel Krieger will have helicopter transport waiting in Paris.

They stamped it, didnít they?  Those damn Gideons.

Donít flatter yourself - six was for <u>Eastern Europe</u>.  You made a lousy deal - ten for the world?  What is that?  But I needed you for the transfer with Max.  I got a little extra change;  and you got a little extra too.

Jack...that's spying.

Doesn't mean it's a signal.  Could just be the hard drive heating up.

This wasnít what we discussed.

Connection denied.

I always check the batteries.

We will both have the Salad Ticino.

Nobody. Loretta is getting married.

You're rich as Roosevelt. You're just cheap, Cosmo.

Johnny Cammareri. I think it's great and about time. What's she gonna do with the rest of her life she don't get married?

What's your news?

I won't come.

That don't sound like Johnny. Where's the ring?

It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring. It's a man's ring.

Let's go tell your Mother.

What are you doing here?

You think so, huh, Stupid? Those dogs love each other.

Excuse me.

That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?

But that wasn't Johnny's fault.

I'm making you a steak.

Loretta.

Seven years ago.

The big part of you has no words and it's-a wolf. This woman was a trap for you. She caught you and you could not get away.  So you chewed off your foot! That was the price you had to pay to be free.  Johnny had nothing to do with it. You did what you had to do, between you and you, and I know I'm right, I don't care what you say. And now you're afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love. That's why there has been no woman since that wrong woman. You are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again!

Get all of me. Take everything.

All right, I'm guilty. I confess!

Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.

I love two things. I love you, and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.

Alright. Meet me at the Met.

I thought I'd try it.  You look good.

You are guilty. I'm guilty.

That's right.

I don't know. Everything seems like nothing now against that I want you in my bed. I don't care if I burn in hell. I don't care if you burn in hell. The Past and Future is a joke to me now. I see that they're nothing, I see they ain't here. The only thing that's here is you. And me. I want you to come upstairs. Now. I tried to take everything last night, like you told me, but I couldn't. I couldn't take everything in a hundred years. It's the way we are. We compound each other.

Good! We can get this out on the table.  I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother. 

Loretta, what are you talking about?

Hi.

I shouldn't.

I don't understand.

This is a good suit.

Alright.

You propose to a woman you should offer her a ring of engagement.

Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.

You have a brother?

Loretta, I can't marry you.

I got married before, you didn't sell.

I'd like to stay, Ma. I love the house. But Pop don't like Johnny.

Just like your father. I lied to him. He thinks you came home last night.

Everything's different.

The bank. OH MY GOD, I FORGOT TO MAKE THE DEPOSIT!

What sins have you to confess?

My granddaughter wants my son to pay for the wedding. But he does not want to pay.

I will. But I must find the right moment.

I came right from the airport.

That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?

You don't know where Loretta is?

Good.

Sure!

It's nothing!

I'm a housewife.

I think it's because they fear death.

Yes.

Yes.

Well. That explains it.

What are you talking about, Raymond? Cosmo can't own the moon.

Did you dress her up like this?

I am...  And this my trusty servant, Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join our court at Camelot..  I must speak with your lord and master.

...What?

Well, it doesn't matter.   Go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.

Please!

But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?

The Bridge of Death? ... which leads to the Grail?

We don't have a lord.

The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held Excalibur aloft from the bosom of the water to signify by Divine Providence ...  that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur ... That is why I am your king! | |                              OLD WOMAN |      Is Frank in?  He'd be able to deal with this one. | DENNIS Look,  strange women lying on their backs in ponds handing out swords ... that's no basis for a system of government.  Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.

One that looks nice.

What?

Come on you pansy!

Come on then.

Had enough?

This is the castle of of my master, Guy de Loimbard.

Bedevere, my Liege.

Er ... We ... Launcelot, Galahad, and I ... Er ...  leap out of the rabbit and ...

Yes, my liege.  Stand by for attack!!

I warned you!

I didn't know you were called Dennis.

Be quiet!

Be quiet!  I order you to shut up.

Shut up!

Come on, patsy.

Course it's a good idea.

And the hat.  But she is a witch.

Why do you think she is a witch?

Ah ... but can you not also make bridges out of stone?

If she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she's made of wood.

I'm not dead!

But, Mother ...

But, Father, I don't really want any of that.

Herbert ...  We built this castle on a bloody swamp, we need all the land we can get.

I was saved at the last minute.

Oh yes, of course!  I thought you meant him!  You know it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard ...

The what?  But you are tired and you must rest awhile.  Midget! Crapper!

Sir Galahad!!

I don't think I was.

Look, let me go back in there and face the peril?

Back to your bed!  At once!

A path!  A little path for the late Knights of Ni!

Yes!  With a herring!  With a herring!  Cut down with a herring!

Stop saying it.  AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...

Look.  I'm warning you.

Brave, Sir Rob ...

That's pretty good for a ghillie.

So?  Someone'll send it on ahead.

But I'm the only one she trusts.

I'm on ninety pounds a year plus seventy pounds for a pile of tartan I'd be wearing anyway.  That's as much as a Page of the Back Stairs gets and that job's only for toffs.  I'm Her Majesty's Highland Servant! Indoors and Out.  There's no stopping me now.

I'm getting dressed.

What do you take me for?

I'm all right.  I just need to rest up a wee bit.  The room ... You don't have to stay.

I'm not having some prattler going through my things.

She's away to Windsor tomorrow.  Talk to her there.

Are you deaf as well as stupid?

My own.

How will I know what she requires?

Aye, do.

Yes.  I do.

There are important papers from --

I don't doubt that the Queen was highly amused.  She has always had a very healthy sense of humor.

We are all of us subject to forces beyond our control, Mr Brown, even you.

Maybe, once.

I do what I do.

See what?

The greasy pole.

I am.

Yes, ma'am.

Aye, ma'am.

What?

Who by?

I heard something.

I'll decide when it's exaggerated.

Yes, ma'am.

Then why send me back to them?!

Oh, several things.

But I lack your prose, Mr Disraeli.

The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?

To know when he'll be king.

You can't know that for sure.

Who?

No, she wasn't.

Of course.

I believe not, ma'am.  I understand -- he'd had rather too much to drink.

I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser than yourself.

He has typhoid fever, ma'am.

If I tell you, then it's no fun.

Well, technically "yes", but this is only the prototype.

How do you do that?

It's the game's logic core.  We actually patterned it after human brainwaves.  I mean, there's a personality in there. That's what makes it so incredible.

And maybe you've been taking too many drugs.

What the hell does that mean?

But he was playing the game.  I mean, you saw him...

Have you played the game yet?  It's incredible!  I was just...

What the hell are you talking about?

No it didn't.  It's just a faulty relay or something.  It happens.

Sure.

She thought Benz was at school.

What?!

...but then it hits the relay stations...

Give me a break, Alex.  What are we going to tell them?  Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...

I was afraid you'd say that.

Yes it does.  Don't you see?  We have to play by the rules.  That's what it wants.

And what if something happens to you? Am I suppose to go in after you alone?!

I already have a boyfriend, Nick.

You've got the schematics, check.

The keys are supposed to be at the end of each level.  Once we get all the keys, we can unlock ARCADE's heart. And then...

Screamer.

We don't have a choice!

Never been on a snowboard.

And then keep on driving?

Oh God...oh god...

Of course I am.

I miss you so much, Alex.  I want so much to be with you...

So what's so different about Arcade? You guys've been talking about it for months.

The Air-Force is working on the same thing.

Give her a chance, will you?

What did you say?

No.

I know.  Where are you Adam?

You're broke!

I know, but you're broke. Where are you?

I'll speak to someone.

Howdy to you.

That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.

Look ... where's this going? What do you want me to do?

I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.

You probably don't remember her, but Louise Bonner lives right over there in number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class.

That's good. They're allowed, but I don't like 'em...for obvious reasons. One man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let's see your Aunt's apartment ... it's a good one.

Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.

You got it! See you later honey.

It's all right gorgeous. Something wrong?

I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty. I'm sure she told you I was coming.

Yes.

Well then, take a seat everyone. Betty why don't you join Jimmy and we'll play the scene. Is there anything you'd like to say Bob... something to Betty before they begin?

Yeah ... Betty. You don't rush it. I don't rush it. We play it close, just like in the movies.

I came back. I thought that's what you wanted.

Before what?

Nothing. I do remember the car crash... I told you... I remember the glass ... I think about that sometimes ... I remember walking here, sort of. Now I remember this place and you. That's about it.

You don't remember anything else?

Maybe the voice isn't Diane Selwyn. Maybe that's your roommate or if it is Diane Selwyn she can tell you who you are.

"I can call them... I can call my dad... "

"You know what I want...it's not that difficult."

"Before what?"

I'm all right.

But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why we shouldn't go see about Diane Selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble.

Keep going. Go around to the back.

But I want to.

It sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new.

Keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's all.

Oh boy.

Interesting.

Where at?

Unreal ... so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days?

Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.

Where's the dock ?

What's going on ?

No time. Get him up.

I made this place..... now listen to me. I'll get out of this room, we have bigger troubles than this....

You're both embezzling. I saw the records.

Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.

Knows ? He watches every "Guest" on tape. This whole place is here for his sick amusement. And no so are we.

Let's go.

There's one more person here for me to visit.

That's a shame.

Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?

Hey , Hey !

Ow...

Knock yourself out.

In the jail cell is a spiral staircase. It leads to the surface. Take it all the way up.

Don't have to tell me twice.

Let's just see if he can make it into round two....

What ? Are you my mother ?

Yes, sir Mom. 

You've got to be kidding me ! His lazy ass couldn't win the special Olympics.

I said NO.

If you want, I can fire you and have someone else who has the balls terminate these worthless people. Which will it be ?

I thought that was Darwin, sir. Or perhaps Nietzsche ?

I am thirty two.

I make roughly four hundred thousand a year.

Son, let's watch the tape.

That's right, sir. He does a thorough background check and if he finds them to be criminal or guilty of embezzlement, then he will put them in the park. He has refused the last three suggested "guests".

What do you mean sir ?

Sir, he created the Park. He would know how to circumvent any of the traps.

John, sir.

Fantastic ! A little faster sweetheart.

I'm just looking for our best interests. May I have the tapes, Bruce ?

I was.

I'm listening.

I don't know.....

He must have had a gun stashed. God damn it !

Why ? The crocks are all going for the dead crock. There's no fun in it. Besides we've got plenty more for them. The night is young....

I can see your small business ! Look at it it's so small.

I think I'll see hat action.

He's got two chices.either it's the Bowling Alley from Hell or Alice in Murderland. See this ? Even Bruce knows that no one can make it out of here in one piece.

How can this happen ?

Thank you.

Zach from work ?

Where are we ?

Why don't you shut up now.

I disagree. I think we should start looking into the severance pay schedules and make sure the people with families can.....

Maybe we should make the time. Especially considering the sixteen million dollars we have set aside expressly to settle law suits from these very events.

Ohhhhh.

I was drinking a little in those days.  I'm drinking a little these days too.

Oh I doubt it...lectures are notoriously boring.

Yeah, well I don't think you're very grateful. A lot of people in your position would say &quot;thank you&quot;.

Suspended from school, my mother??

Okay thanks, atta girl.

Well you know what I mean.

Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.

Her favorite poet.

Hi Dad.

I just called to say that I'm having a really great time.

Actually, I wanna see Jeffrey Pommeroy.

Totally groovy huh?

I love you too sweetie, bye.

Phil's moving to LA, Grammoo's passing, the baby being born, Vada's report, I think...

I was pushing as fast as I could.

Ummmmm, look, I...I...

You are?



That's all right, you know what? You sound just sounded just like your mother...she told great stories. Stories with crazy accents and...special effects.

Yeah like, switching a lamp on and off when she was talking about lightning...audiences love stuff like that. And your mom knew how to work an audience.

More than anything in the world.

Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?

I guess what I mean is, my mother married my dad after you...and then I was born, so I thought that...maybe you got divorced because of me.

Oh God, he's coming over here, act natural, totally natural.

I don't know. And I don't care, Kevin's a jerk and I don't like him anymore. He's all yours!

Well...I'm not supposed to talk about it, but since I'm gonna write about it I might as well tell you. She was a spy against the Russians.

Well actually I was born in Siberia and then they shot her and sent me home to my Dad.

No, not here in Pennsylvania, she went to Russia undercover with her acting troupe and got a lot of highly sensitive secret plans sent back. Just when she was about to go home, she got caught, and they killed her.

If you're selling Girl Scout cookies I'm borderline diabetic.

My mother.

I want juice!

I won't.

Well look, I know that all you care about is your precious mini-bike. It's obvious you have no sense of historical perspective, I think we're here.

Excuse me, pardon, thank you, excuse me.

It's not funny! I mean what am I gonna do? Without that yearbook I'm lost. I can't just walk around town looking for someone with a Wilson High School Letter sweater!!!

What difference does it make?

I'd never do that.

At least it gives you plenty of exercise.

This isn't just a mood ring.

Well, it doesn't open cans or anything but it...it's sort of a reminder of a friend of mine.

This is a totally barbaric custom.

I already did, it's a totally barbaric custom...but on you, it looks good.

Nick?

You better ace it...you sacrificed our whole vacation.

Part adventure...part miracle.

Was Rose.

Yes, it does.

Bye.

How's this for a solution. We'll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself....

I don't know, he's got an awful lot on his mind right now.

You know how I feel about you.

Bye Niece, Vada.

You couldn't?

All right, so you don't like jewelry but...eh...you do like...eh...good music. Liszt, one of my favorites.

Hungarian. Famous for their beautiful music...and beautiful women.

I bet your mom sang to you.

Is there milk in them already?

This is one of my favorite things, her passport.

What do you mean?

You have no idea.

Beidermeyer that's it, what a mad man.

He is?

I like to buy off all the railroads.

All right, here.

Well, sometimes when we get 'em, they're not completely dead, you know, like when they cut a chickens head off and it still runs around crazy.

It's her home! It's where she lives!!

What?

My __EX__ wife seems to have ripped off my camper.

That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms.

Yes.

What Hurts Vada?

I think it's still available.

Yes they are.

Deceased.

This was the Reverend Porter's wife, you have her looking like a two dollar hooker.

That wasn't an image. She WAS an old school Marm.  Fix it.

Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered. And the room's all set up.

Oh Hi, what can I do for you?

Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family.

I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.

Are you mad at me?

Here?

See, you're not that out of touch.  You're good.

Dad?

That's a lot of money for a little girl.

What?

Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?

Why?

Can I go too?

Ahh, Vada, just put anything you want in the cart, anything at all.  I don't know what's gotten into her today.

No, sweetie, not yet.

In a minute, look it's hot, sweetie you'll burn your nose, look out.

Not acknowledging Harry's comment You'll be okay little fish.

Hi.

Yes.

No sweetheart, you can't.

She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her.

Nothing, I'm dressing.

Oh come on.

Are you sure about all this?

That's what I do. Do you wanna do it??

Will you tell her I came by?

It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.

That's Suzanne.  She and I are gonna be married this Fall.

I...I was gonna bring her to class next week. I wanted to hear your poem. Oh Vada, please honey I cared for him too, Vada please! Vada, Vada sweetheart don't.....

Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he seems like the old Harry.

Well he wasn't one of the Marx brothers, but he made me laugh.

I am.

My ball, I lost my ball.

Come here, sit down.

Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.

They'll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them. The first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow.

NO!, He's fine.  Fish are very resilient animals you know. Don't worry, I won't get another fish.

Vada, Vada, what's the matter?

Well he just left, what's wrong?

I'm eleven and a half.

That's Mr. Bixler, let's go talk to him.

Why? It's not dinner time yet.

It's only black when you're around 'cause you put me in a bad mood.

You could pick that scab on your arm.

A girl can never wear enough eye shadow.

No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.

It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud.

I stopped that!

HEY YOU!!!!  I'm gonna get you!!!  I'll get you!!!!

But I have my clothes on!

Hi, wanna ride bikes?

Please, it's real hot, maybe we can go swimming?

Not true.

But then I won't be able to see anything.

Would you think of me?

Well if you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.

Well, I'm close to her.  I wanted to meet the one that got away.

I honestly wish I could...

Which is everyone you couldn't get in.

... weeks.

He's still in love with you.

He says, "Swear.  When we're both 28, if we've never been married... we marry each other!"

You have a real philosophy of life.

Chill?  Since when do you say ch...

It's not his happiness you're feeling guilty about...

Impressive.

Tell him you love him.  With all your heart.

Hey, handsome.  Brevity this...

Oh, you're more than okay.

I can be quick.  I can even be funny.

Which was the disqualifying factor?

... cigars in bed? I broke him on that.  But the bathroom's a swamp, he wears Reeboks to dinner, tells the same, admittedly funny, jokes three hundred times...

Only.  If he wants to.

We settled this.  And I reneged. That wasn't fair.

I had this crank call?  From some guy who thinks he saw her? I said, what would a bride be doin', on her wedding...

I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.

Sir, this is important! Haven't you ever in your life cut one corner, to make something important turn out right?

I know Ben.

It doesn't say th...

I told him, get the important stuff, Kim's ring.  I'll collect the inconsequentials.

Nobody has.  So far.

I need to make some calls. Could I use... your office?

Yeh, well my old machine kept eating messages.  I tried constructively ignoring it in hopes of improvement, but finally...

You don't understand.  I've never felt this way about anybody!

But they're so down to earth, such wonderful people...

She admires.  Tommy Lasorda.

She finds him "personable."

Hey, cabs are expensive.  I'm cheap, remember?

That would be a girl.  I don't even know.

I switched that around when you weren't looking.

You need a baby-sitter.  That's what I'm here for.

Never can tell.

No.  I've got you.

If you like.

It's more than that.

Tomorrow is Sunday.  Nobody's doing business.  Crack of dawn, Monday, Walter'll take you up there...

Mike.  I can't believe I'm doing this to you on the night before your wedding.  But I think you need and deserve to know...

... yeah, that.

Shhh.

I didn't know it would get sent.  I just wanted you to... get mad at Kimmy... and...

This is where I proposed.

Course, if it's later rather than sooner, I'd hate to be you at six o'clock.  You've got a lot of explaining to...

That's little egotistical.

I travel every week.  College ball, motor sports, training camps...

To the twins' soiree?  So they can paw you and drool...?

... and public relations is a big problem area for him.

... and you knew about this.

Well, forgive me for screwing up your plans!

... Mr. Julianne Potter, prominent New York drag queen.

Oh the way out of the crab house? We asked Michael if we could see the ring?

You're much more his type.

You got a real good memory, Star.

Okay by me - I'd sure like to see that Opryland.

Yes. I'm cutting a record.

Well, I just wondered 'cause being from out or town I wouldn't be able to make anything.

What's wrong honey.

How did you come in here?

Eater  says she doesn't see how you do it.

Oh just about everything, I guess. Those doctors started on an overhaul and don't want to quit. They keep taking things out. She's going to come home an egg shell. Tough, though.. She's tough.

Green.

Thank you-- Yes, I am.

You get her those Vitamin E right away.

She's going to rest now.

Oh, sure.

Barnett, John Triplette. How's she doing?

Well, I just thought I'd call.

Haven? Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were fourteen.

He knows better.

His word? Are you telling me Haven promised you something?

They can come to the concert in the park.

Third party?

I don't care. She's always been neutral in politics and that's not going to change.

Hi. Come on in. Mary!

President.

Okay.

Stop it!

When is it?

Bill, he's a crazy man.

How come?

Where the hell have you been?

To the bathroom.

It's the den mother.

National?

What crook?

Sure thing. Put them here... I'll take them.

She's in Paris.

Harvard?

Okay... you get to sleep. I'll see you in the morning. Good night.

She's been in the hospital two weeks yesterday.

It's hard to say. Doctors thought she'd come home a week ago. All it was was appendix.

Replacement party.

No.

Ah, hello. My name is Kenneth Fraser... And I'm here from Terre Haute, Indiana. Ah, listen ... somebody stole my handles.

Sixty-three.

When I was little, in church.

Linnea?

I'm here.

What do you mean?  You said you wanted to see me.

Who is this, right?  I called you last night.

I'm not sure.

Fifteen minutes?

Don't you worry about Sueleen Gay.

He's pretty well known down here.

Sleeping.

Oh?

Did it break?

How long have you been together?

Where are you from?

I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be something?

Well, honey, I sure hope it comes your way then.

May I see your costume?

I see.

The style of fighting that Tim studied didn't believe in belts.

Tim studied several styles, but his favorite was Jeet Kune Do.

Yes, they were.

It wasn't 'till we got on the ground floor that I totally realized they weren't gonna shoot unless we shot first. When we got out of the stairwell, I remember thinking, 'Oh my God. This might work.' But Mickey knew it would work all along. There wasn't any doubt in his mind. It's not like there was and he just didn't show it. He knew it would work.

I wondered how long it would be before we'd get to be alone together. And I wondered if I could wait that long.

Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?

We had nothing to do with that riot. That riot was just -- whatchmacallit --

We still got a few tricks up our sleeves.

The prison board made the decision. A board of which I belong. We're the who. The why is simple. Mickey and Mallory are mentally ill and need to be under a doctor's care, where hopefully they'll receive the help they need.

Ain't love grand.

How's it goin'?

I've never wounded anything in my life. I got you locked right between the eyes.

It's video.

Ready.

Whose ratings were higher?

Have you talked to Mallory about this?

Okay, let's cut it.

Could I get a Coke for Mickey?

Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try.

So, what now?

I said I'd give you a interview. Now unless I'm mistaken, we just did a interview.  We did an interview, didn't we?

NO!!!

I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt, but--

You made every day like kindergarten.

Unfortunately, yes.

I do, too.

And a snake-eye glare.

Yes.

They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'

Fine. Roger, what the hell are you doing? You're bothering the serial killer.

We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest, darkest cell in the whole place. But it just so happens that right now he's got a special visitor.

Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready to roll.

They're real Goddamn good. They'll be there for when ya need 'em. Where are they?

Okay.

Perfecto!

Fucking dammit! Mickey hold onto that thought. Reload, quick!

Why?

Oh yes, indeed. Top flight.

They got a asshole over here.  A asshole sitting down reading a magazine over there.  A asshole perched up there.  Assholes everywhere. Hey, maybe if we were doin' that kiss, kiss, bang, bang stuff we'd need all those assholes, too. What we're about is intimacy. We're about two people having a conversation. Say I was interviewing you. All I want you to worry about is what I ask you. I want a trust to develop. If you're thinking about all this...  ...you're not going to relax, a trust won't develop, we'll be talking a each other instead of to each other, there will be no chance for intimacy.

Lose 'em.

Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very familiar with Mickey Knox's career.

Wayne, if it was anybody else---

Don't call my men assholes.

Man, the darkest thing they got in there is Coca-Cola.

Now, if you want to work like a real nigger, you can always go out and chop cotton.

No thanks.

You in a big hurry, boy?

All right, you get out of here, man!

I don't know what you're talkin' about.

Well, what d'you know?!

What d'you think?

I been sendin' her money.

Name's Duff.

Thanks.

That ain't my idea of friendliness.

Oh yeah? That's good.

You must be new in town.

Oh yeah? Well, I guess you got no choice.

You don't think much of yourself, do you?

No thanks.

I get it.  Yeah, I can see your old man with a shot-gun right now.

Hell, baby, I'm not in the third grade. Well, look - what' we gonna do next time -- have a nice long chat in the parlor?

No.

That's the way he is.

I didn't know you had one.

No. Women're always followin' me 'round.

Yeah, it's just a coincidence.

I'll see you later.

Okay, I guess.

Yeah. Wouldn't be no picnic for you. I ain't exactly housebroken.

Yeah?

You still didn't answer my question.

We can always do that, Duff.

Water pump's busted. I don't know if it's worth fixin', but I need that car.

Sure, baby. 'Fact, I don't ever have to work no more. When that baby comes, I can just stay home and send you back to school. How about that?

I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.

Not if you see them for what they are, Duff.

When I get set, I'll send for you.

Duff--

Like what?

You gonna sit at home the rest of your life? Jesus!

Okay.

Workin' a saw mill.  Here's to.

Plannin' on getting married?

I heard you.

Great.

Better get him to a hospital.

No, thanks.

Don't do her no good to go into a tree.

Whenever he's got an edge on.

Yeah, sure. Good luck.

I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.

That's right.

How come you all ain't sendin' them to the same school?

Can't live without trouble, can you?  Nice place you got here. Real nice.

I doubt it.

It ain't in me.

It's for your own good.

How you doin'?  Hi there!

'Musta knocked her up.

That'll make the folks very happy.

That's not the play.  Omar'll get a shot off.  I can still talk to him, Nate, I just need time.

Of course.

No. I only needed the code from you.

My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me.

Straylight. Kitchen dock.

He's a vat grown Ninja, the Royal Family's bodyguard. Watch out for him, he's no joke.

I was set up.  She looked at least eighteen.

You son-of-a-bitch, you're crazy.

And how do you suggest I do that?

We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.

I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.

Dixie McCoy

You'll be ready for a trial run in two days. If your splices hold, you'll use McCoy to trace the A.I.'s coordinates.

No, but it traced me.

Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.

Are you even really alive?

The words?

I don't have a girl.

Yeah.

Fine, Dixie. Fine.

Yeah. That was me.

As far as they know, that's absolutely true.

Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?

Jah guides us.

No. It's gotta be more than that. That hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart. Too powerful.

We got problems topside.

Not for long. It needs me alive and I still need its access code. You got a better idea?

Less than thirty minutes.

It's coming.

I said, it's coming. Just get me in, man.

What?

This time it's different. Someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens. Five grams of liquid ketamine. It was supposed to be Jo Jo's score.

I don't know. I don't know...

I'll give it my best shot, mother fucker.

For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.

What?

Couple of days. They'll examine you.

The way I feel, believe me, it'll help.

A regular Fagan.

Okay fine. Let's get this over with.

Put the gun down, Case.

I don't sleep much. You packed?

That's risky gear. It can drive you schizo.

...And if I guess wrong?

What is it?

You're out of time, man.

Try being named after a guitar- playing pussycat.

Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot.

That's the old drive-in. They call it "The Court". Now it's just a continuous party for Guy's group.

Are you kidding, Josie? It's lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame.

Well I'm so glad that you guys are.

Nope.

I thought this was a 45-minute seminar.

What about the "Roaring Twenties" or "The 80's"?

Roger in Op/Ed.

You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, "I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him."

And what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can?

Yeah.

I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date?

Look. You're way under 30, you're cute, some guys find white Carter's underwear sexy  If you talk to his nose, you don't even notice the eye.

I've kissed guys. I've just never kissed a guy. Felt that thing--

I am not letting you out of the house in that, young lady.

Can I just say--I totally love Ex- Lax.

Uh uh. I'm Disco Barbie.

That you would trip on your Barbie heels and I'd get named prom queen?  Did I say that out loud?

It is hoped that it's not a mess. "Hopefully" is an adverb. It means "with hope". You have it defining the copy, and I'm pretty sure the copy doesn't have feelings.

You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?

A flack jacket.

Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.

Kristen got a quote?

You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.

Maybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story.

Are you in special ed?

Dude, you rock!

Oh yeah. The best. Josie takes in the spectacle around her.

Maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.

Wow. That's big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person.

Someday this luau is going to be all mine!

No. They're at the Franklin Hint Expo at the Skokie Holiday Inn.

I can't do this.

With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.

Rufus?

I know.

wasn't even thinking about-

Sorry. Forgetful.

That's okay. It's nice to have someone to talk to--

When are you going to open your eyes?

Thanks.  They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?

Do you think you'll find her?

Wow. You believe in me that much--

You were attracted to me?

Wait, I was going to tell you--

I don't! Look, you could get to know me, again.

Why?

I know, like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid.

You so do not deserve to be prom queen.

Relax, Monty. It's just my sister.

Well, a ball player.

Maybe we should sit.

Lock.

<i>                      I'm not the dumb one...</i>

<i>                      Now in the box, we'll wait and hide Until his curiosity Entices him to look inside...</i>

And heavy...

I know.

Good.  I'm hungry.

He's conducting experiments of his own.

Who's Lisa?

It's not the gas, Dad!

What are you talking about?

I wasn't sure, Ken...

Are you nuts or something?  What the hell is that going to do?

Not too far.  My folks bought a place over on Elm Street.

My Dad.  He played in the minors for a while, when he got out of college.

Yeah, well, Schneider's got a stick up his ass today.

You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.

Look, I don't care if you believe me or not...

How come?

That's okay, I wanted to.

That's typical.  I hope she didn't expect to make the best seller list with this thing.

Wow...

Only it was more like, you know, sleep- walking.  All I know is I woke up on the cellar floor next to it.

Yeah, I know...synapses neurong...

I don't know.  Concentrate or some- thing.

Ghostbusters are fearless.

Why won't you talk to me?

he's just waiting to take me.  When I sleep.

You okay?

Thanks, Mom.

Don't hold your breath.

Wait and see.

I gotta stay up, Max.

Just tonight, please?  I can't handle the nightmare.  Not tonight.  Not after Phillip.

Don't fucking humor us.  We're not in the mood.

No fuckin' way.  We're a team.

Do you still...see each other?

It's an amazing gift.

He's real.

He's heavy in the halls...

I don't know.

Those are ancient history.

Stay out of my face or I'll go straight to Max.

Fuck off.

Thank you.

Fucked up chromosomes, man.  Think about it.  Their parents all dropped acid in the Sixties.

Nancy...

We lost a kid about a month ago to Fairview.  I don't know where he got the razor...but he cut off his own eyelids to stay awake.

Make sure to check in with Max, he'll give you the 25 cent tour.

Most authentic Mexican food in Springwood, which isn't saying much.  your parents still live around here?

I'm sorry, Nancy.  The answer is no.

Try me.

I can do that.

Everybody take five.

There's nothing we can do.  It's out of our hands.

Just go.  Kristen needs you.  Keep her awake somehow.  Do it.

What about Kristen?

I come from time to time.  When I'm needed.

The bastard son of a hundred maniacs. Some say he was murdered, though no body was ever found.

I won't allow it.

Hi.  Good Lord -- you're the spitting image of...

I'm a vegetarian.

And you.  I'll wait till you've gone before I tell him you're a vegetarian.

I'm an actress.

Films mainly.

Eighteen yards.  That's my house there.

No.

Really, no.

Yes.  Well.  My pleasure.

Thanks.  Well...

Oh -- Okay.

No, it's a stupid privacy thing.  I always choose a cartoon character -- last time out, I was Mrs. Bambi.

Well, I've been on a diet since I was nineteen, which means basically I've been hungry for a decade.  I've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one of whom hit me: and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment. Meantime, it cost millions to get me looking like this...

It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.

What did you say?

You said 'whoopsidaisies.'

No, you were brilliant

This is the place.

No, that's fine.  It's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star.  It was a thrill for me.  How is he?

Well done you.

'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever your name is, I promised little Jimmy I'd be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that I may be a little late.'

Well, get a message through to him too.

Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.'

Yes.  Always have had.

No.  What's that?

What?

No seriously.  I mean, they're just breasts.  Every second person in the world has got them...

Stay forever.

I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...

I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.

Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.

Yes.  The thing is... I have to go away today but I wondered, if I didn't, whether you might let me see you a bit... or, a lot maybe... see if you could... like me again.

That's fine.  There's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict.

Yes.

Tempting but... no, thank you.

Is that right?

Miracles do happen.

It was sort of sweet actually -- I mean, I know she's an actress and all that, so she can deliver a line -- but she said that she might be as famous as can be -- but also... that she was just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.

Working with Leonardo.

Hun -- this is Anna.  Anna -- this is Honey -- she's my baby sitter.

Well, thanks, that's great.

How you doing?  I thought you guys all wore those penguin coats.

This is Henry James film?

Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain.

Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?

Can you tell her I'll ring her back.

Hello, Anna ahm...  Scott -- have some wine.

No, it doesn't.

I think you do, yes.

She's perfect, perfect.

Is it someone we know?

Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months.  I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.

How about Miss Flintstone?

Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.

Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.

Yes, she is fairly fabulous.

Right.  Vicious circle.  And then I was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and I thought -- cool. Kind of spacey.

Absolutely not.

No, 'fraid not.

I have some parsnip stew from last week. If I just peel the skin off, it'll be perfect.

And she's in your house.

Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one?

No -- you're right.

I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub.

Right -- let's talk about rent...

Three.

What book?

Okay -- what if I did have a book down my trousers?

Yes, that's perfectly correct.

No, Miss Ratched...

I can only speculate as to the reasons why.

I was in luh-love with her.

I-I-I...

You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!

Yes, ma'am.

Now that you mention it, I sure would like to call my aunt up in Portland and tell 'er where I am so she can come visit me.

Yeah, well, it just pains me somethin' awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water...

Yes, Mister McMurphy?

Right!

No way.

Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy?

He's into his wind-up. Here comes the pitch. Strike on the inside corner!

He's into his wind-up. Here's the next pitch... and it's a hit! It's a hit!

Mr. McMurphy, you had no right to take these men out with you!

No, it was irresponsible!

Yes, ma'am?

Ma'am, I'm as gentle as a puppy dog. Why, I haven't licked the tar out of an aide for two weeks! Hi ya, Doc!

Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with pleasure.

Please see to Mister Bromden.

Y-Y-You m-mean th-the pr-president of the P-P-Patients C-Council?

What did I see 'cept a grown man gettin' whipped so bad he can't laugh anymore.

Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad?

Y-y-yes, a b-b-bus!

Ease up on the star drag, keep the tie up, up and work hell outta that fella.

Good boy, thank you, Billy.

Wu-wu-wu I-I-I-I th-th-think sh-sh sh-she's th-th-th-the ma-ma-ma-most bu-bu-bu-beautiful wu-wu-wu-woman in th-th-the whole world!

No.

Yeah...

Wow! They're so quiet.

Well, okay, but I just want to look at the facilities. That's all.

Does that mean we have to cut him loose?

Me, too...

Your buddy is callin' ya.

She ain't peckin' at your eyes, buddy.

You mean you're going to try to pick that thing up and shove it through the window?

What for?

That's nice. Send me a post card.

No!

I'm not running a charity ward...

McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...

What's this?

Whadaya bet, Cheswick?

Hold it a minute.

Yeah, Mac?

Okay, Martini. That's okay. Now you watch me.

Me, too! Me, too!

Yeah, it's cold!

He's not!

Why, I'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute.

Well, you're here for a ninety-day observation period, Mister McMurphy. I'd like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. So, I'd like your cooperation!

Good. Good.

Come on, Doc, you know as well as I do what's been comin' down in that loony bin.

I'm afraid not.

I'm sorry, but I can't keep you here.

We'll let you know.

'Kay, Mac!

What's going on?

Oh, yeah?

You're on.  Let's go! An' keep it quiet.

I'm not going back in there. I told ya this was a one way trip. Now stand aside.

Sure...

'Kay...

Okay. How you doing?

What?

Big man!

On what?

Hey, Martini! Psst! Scanlon! Ya dumb goons, come back here!  Come on, let's get 'em!

Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth considerin'.

Bet you ass...

Why, sure, ma'am...

Ah guess the natives are restless, ma'am...

Shhh... let's move it away from the window...

Shhh, please, Miss. Keep it down...

Yeah, well, I'll tell ya somethin'. I'll tell ya somethin'. I had this boyfriend, Chuck.  Ya know him, Mac. Ya remember, Chuck.

He's dead.

Look, she wasn't a relative, okay? I don't know who she is.

Buona notte.

I'm very sorry.  Perhaps you misunderstood?

So.  How do we get to Rome?

What for?

No.

It just happened.  I didn't plan it.  I was alone.  And he was... there.  But now everything's changed.  I owe it to him to let him know.  I need to tell him.

I've never been more sure of anything in my life.

Let's find a telephone.

You're sure...

Oh no.  Do you?

Dwayne?

Ask her if she knows where he is?

Ask her if she knows how I might reach him?  If she has a telephone number?

What's mezzaluna?

Don't be stupid, Larry.  If he's my destiny, then, obviously, he has to be alive.

If I live here, then he lives here. Fate wouldn't make a mistake like that.  And stop talking.  You're gonna ruin the spell.

But, Faith--

Hm.

Well, he'd have to hurry.  My flight leaves at four o'clock.

Huh?  Uh, yeah-- I've gotta run. Tell Dwayne hi.  Maybe someday we can all get together.

NO.

Oh no, I don't think that would be a good idea.

He likes to read...  Did he mention anyone in particular?

Yeah.

Hi.  Are you... busy?

You want a hint?  I'll give you a hint.  You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine--

You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.

Gee, I'm flattered.  What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.

I brought you that, too.

Well, not exactly...

Brunello di Montalcino, '85, please.

Really?

What?

You're an accountant for cryin' out loud.

It's a metaphor.  It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them.  And instead wind up with nothing.

He's a podiatrist or something.

No.  He's never asked me.

Oh, I don't know.  I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be.  You know, like in the movies.

It's a coincidence.

But it's July.

Because you were afraid to fly.

Faith, I've seen it already, okay? If I spot somebody who's got a head that's an eighth of an inch around, standing underneath a tuba, I'll recognize him from the photo. Otherwise, I'm telling you, it's not gonna do me any good.

And you know what I thought then, Kate?  I thought, I hope someday I have somebody who loves me that much.  I still hope that.

Her brother.

You've travelled over six thousand miles and now you're gonna play hard to get?

I told you.  If he sees me here with another guy, he's gonna think I'm here with another guy.  I just don't want to send any confusing signals.

Faith.  So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe.  At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales.

What?

I'll be back before you leave.

He's down in someplace called Positano.  Peter says we can make it there by morning.

Is Damon Bradley here?

Uh huh...  Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?

When you could've found one in America.

No.  Well, I don't know.  Well, maybe.  Later.

She's saying he's a-- a--  porco.

Oh.

You miss me?...

It's not exploitation.  These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation?  She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.

Are you saying you just made the whole thing up?  The guy never even existed?

She's not here.

He just got a call from "Mr. Upstairs." Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot.

I'd get over there, Terry. I'll take the little lady home.

I know what's eatin' you, kid. But I got two thousand dues-payin' members in my local that's seventy-two thousand a year legitimate and when each one of 'em puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work steady well, you figure it out. And that's just for openers. We got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the world. Everything that moves in and out we take our cut.

In a minute.

It's a living.

Thicker than water.

Maybe.

Yeah yeah I guess I do but there's a lot more to this whole thing than I thought, Charley.

I don't know I don't know! I tell you I ain't made up my mind yet. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.

Don't say that!

Charley... . Charley... . Wow... .

Gee, when you tipped one seventy-five you were beautiful. You should've been another Billy Conn. That skunk I got to manage you brought you along too fast.

I always had a bet down for you. You saw some money.

Edie, I do what I can. I'm in the church when you need me.

Hello, Edie.

You hear that, Terry?  Terry, did you hear that?  You lost the battle but you have a chance to win the war. All you gotta do is walk.

I'll get home all right now.

Man, you were a mess!

The thought I'm tryin' to get over is you grew up beauteeful. Remember me?

Some people got faces that stick in your mind.

How would you've done it?

Well he played it smart. Too many good-for-nothin's around here. All they got on their mind's a little beer, a little pool, a little  I better get you home.

Good. So do I.

Oh she's a beauty.

I don't know.

Hit me again, Mac.

What do they do for you, except get in your way?

Well, nobody, I guess. But that Father Barry, I didn't like the way he kept lookin' at me.

Edie, down here it's every man for himself. It's keepin' alive! It's standin' in with the right people so you can keep a little loose change jinglin' in your pocket.

I don't want it. But why don't you stay and finish your drink.

I thought I felt mean tonight. But I'm not I'm just all mixed up... .

I won't eat cheese for no cops, that's for sure.

Go ahead, wear it.

I know... I know... .

I just told the Father.

He's going to have to grow up too.

Tell it to me in there and my lips are sealed. But if I dig it out myself I can use it where it'll do the most good.

What are you going to do?

Edie. The Commission. Your subpoena. I know you got a subpoena.

Why don't you go and chase yourself?

Father, one thing you got to understand. On the dock we've always been D 'n D.

If I stick my neck out, and they chopped it off, would that be the end of it? Or are you ready to go all the way?

What about it?

I told you I don't know nothin' and I ain't saying nothin'.

's all right, kid. I took care of 'em myself this morning.

My lead bird. He's always on that top perch.

Yeah, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You don't think I should turn him in... .

Easy. Easy, boy.

He followed my birds into their coop. Here, you want him?

By way of Chicago?

Coffee, that's a laugh. His belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey.

I can't believe it a small fortune.   You can't buy me you're still a bum!  'Bye, Edie. Lord have mercy on Joey. 

Nolan, me lad, ye're dreamin' again.

When we knock off let's have a bit of a party. We'll drink to God and Ireland, its whiskey and its women, to Joey and Edie  and death to tyrants everywhere... .!

Definitely! Nolan, my boy, you're a walkin' distillery.

Keep Charley out of this.

I do not joke in my proposal.

No.  It's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.

You wouldn't understand.  Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.

Where?

Then..then what's that music?

What help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night?

It's an initiation all right, but not of a college as you and I know them.  Nothing alive looks like that!

I'm not sure...

Be careful!--They'll see you.

Be careful!

Nothing is worth your life.

I'm frightened.  I'm so frightened.

Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us.

Yes, that sudden.  If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this.  It's all your fault.

I still don't know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you.

Of course I do.

A situation easily remedied.

She loved the bull ring and the matador.  She danced to their destruction. Now she dances to her own destruction.  Her dance is of skulls.

It would seem so, Master.

It would seem so, Master

Ahh, she will be yours.

I know the laws of the night. I state there is still time for yet another.

Well then let us proceed.

I will decide the conclusion.

You mean...!

You are the keepers of the Damned.  You two know them all. And I am tired of this usual type of entertainment. I want...a decided change.

Ahh, good.  Then I will see them.  Dismiss the rest.

I'm so frightened.

I have promised both The Wolf Man and The Mummy a reward.  It could be that <b>you</b> are that reward.

Aaaahhhhnnnahhhnnnggnnn.

Aaahhnnnahnnnn.

Aaaaannnnnuuunnnuhhhhh?

Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?

And the one driving the other car?

Yes, it is.

From Glades to the turnpike.  Then I left with Glenn.

I know a Glenn.

He'd call every once in a while.

He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say about me?  In the trunk?

He said he was a card player.  I could live with that.  I never knew he robbed banks till he got busted with that car that caught fire -- if you can imagine something like that happening, comes out of the bank and the car's on fire. I did go see him in jail to tell him I was filing for divorce.  He said, "Okay."  Jack's so easy going.  He was fun, but never what you'd call a real husband.

Really.  Hm.

Buddy'll take care of him.  Keep him out've trouble.  He's Jack's conscience. Always has been.  He tell you how they met?

Yes.

Why you want to do that, to a frien'?

That's the turnpike up there.  Glenn's waiting with the other car.

Get the shotgun.  And her purse.  I'd like to know who she is.

The green-and-whites saw us.  One of 'em starts thinking, what's that car doing there?  Ties it to the break and turns around...

I brought 'em, they're back at Glades in the Cadillac.  You wanted to take her car.

How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?

Cause she had her hand on her gun the whole time, waiting to make her move.

We'll leave first thing in the morning.

Her phone's probably tapped.

In here with my suntan lotion and beach towel.  That's her place.

Jesus, look at that wall.  Place almost looks like a prison.

And who watches your back?

They sure do.

I'll go with you.

Jack --

Really?  Huh.  He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed.

When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks.

You have to know what you're talking about.

Call and tell you.

I report to the FBI, first thing they're gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee.

No, I didn't know that.

Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer, I'm armed.

We're a few minutes away.  Just sit tight, stay outta the house till we get there, understand?

Wait, I know him --okay?

Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.

It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper.  Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh?

Let's go outside and talk.

Give me a minute, talk to Buddy.

Break and enter, shit.  Take it and git, how it's done.  Don't waste any time.  That's how you do it.

I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest, both of you guys.

For your breath.  You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth.

I believe it.  You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.

You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.

Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of me.

What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.

<i>Network</i>.  Yeah, she was good.

Peter Finch.

Bleeding on a country road.

Shit...

You won't do that.

Love it.

I don't have a problem with it.

I called your room from downstairs.

She did, huh.

He killed a police officer.

I couldn't believe it.  I was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet.  Like if we could take a time-out...

In the trunk?

Yeah?  She said that to you?

Okay.  How many going out?

Oh, uh, right, thanks...

Really?  Well, I uhhh...

You're the one with balls, Dick, say something like that to someone like Glenn.  Or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute.

Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You <u>told</u> him you keep 'em at your house.

First, I'm goin' to Israel for a year, study the Talmud, work on a Kibbutz... then come back, maybe take some tennis lessons.

Oh, yeah, I'm calm.  In fact, I'm totally "relaxed..."

How are you, Richard?

Five point two.

For a time.

That time?

Cheaper I guess, take us both down in one van.

Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a sewer?

Glenn?

I remember you now.  Shit.

No way, man, no fuckin' way am I gonna turn myself in.

Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.

Really?

Oh, I'm here, all right.  I'm very here. Question is, why aren't <u>you</u> here?

Me?

Can I do what?

You find him, tell him the dog got run over and I'm out of grocery money.

That's Kenneth, my brother.  He's talking on the phone.

Thanks.

Your dog was killed?

Happy birthday, kid.  You want another Coke?

What're you doing at Glades?

I'd like that.

What'd I say?

Huh.

So?

I knew it, soon as I saw they were offering a reward.

Well, I need that...

Where the fuck is Foley?

Jack Foley, famous bank robber.

That's your line for tonight, ya know.

He was that good?

You don't forget love, Honey.  Not ever.

Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to matter.

You guys know her?!  I gotta have an intro!  Man, I'd like to --

Hey, you wanna test my limits, you better line up a couple dozen women on the GROUND...cause I got NO limits in the air!

Danny, you know how many times I saw you come to school with a black eye or a busted nose, and couldn't do a thing about it -- for you, or for your mother... or your father, with his lungs scorched out with mustard gas, and more left of his lungs than there was of his spirit? You've made your sacrifice, Danny.  It's time I made mine.

It's a test.  If I asked her to come and she came, it wouldn't tell me anything. If I tell her not to come, and she comes...then I know she loves me.

Why be sorry?  That's what you feel, it's better to come out with it.

Sure you did.  So come on.  Say what you think.

How sweet.  Is that when you put the move on her?

Yeah.  So you can call me if you need help.

I'm out of fuel!

No.  You're trying to beat me.

They'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch.  That'll help.

I can't make it.

Who's gonna to that?  Japan is four thousand miles away.  So you guys just arrived, huh?

The navy will get us to within 400 miles of the Japanese coast.  We'll launch off the carriers from there.

We won't have the fuel to get back to the carriers; they'll turn and run back to Hawaii the minute we're airborne.

Never, Sir.  I just meant it's dangerous only for the kind of pilot who wants to show off, rather than inspire the other pilots in his unit.  And all you've done for me, Sir, working out the transfer, I did it to say thanks.  To honor you, Sir. What the French call a "homage."

Thank you, Sir.

We can explain, Colonel.

Bombers.

Tell me something, Dorie.  A man as big as you -- and smart too, you knew where to come when your ship couldn't help -- do you still have to fight with your fists to get respect?

You too, 'Mam.

You too, Lieutenant.

No, he...got some news today.  He'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight.

The only reason it's hard to say is that I keep thinking I don't have the right to say it.  But I've got to because it's true.  I love you.  That must surprise you.

I'm so sorry for what you must've gone through, but I'm back.

It's not that I didn't mean everything I wrote.  It's just that -- I thought you were dead.  And now --

There's nothing you can do here, they'll die or they won't, we just --

I need to tell you something.  I didn't know what it was to lose somebody, to see death and find how much it scares you. That you haven't lived and loved enough. I didn't understand.  Forgive me.

They were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along.  I wrote Colonel Doolittle, and told him I needed to see you before you go.

We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral.

God help them.

Well, I like to speculate. This book I'm reading right now, a woman in Colorado says she lived in Ireland a hundred and fifty years ago. Her name was Bridey Murphy- and she gives names and dates and where she lived. She was hypnotized. Big bestseller.

Stag movies. Smokers.

It wouldn't be a lodge without hats.

Come off it, Peggy. And what do you mean your house? This is my house. I paid for it, I'm still paying for it.

Oh yeah?

Thanks.

Great, isn't it?

Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?

You mean my wang? Listen, it's running real late.

You're damn right! Jesus! Peggy! You sure know how to spoil a mood.

Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?

I have to talk to you..

Let's go down to the basement.

I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night. I didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride.

Charlie,. I've been trying to postpone this. But what's the point? It's over.  I don't want to hurt you. This is very hard for me. I'm doing this for both of us. I really want you to be happy.

I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to...  Good dog, Rusty. Good dog.

Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it.

How could you possibly know what I've been going through?

It opens, too. Look inside.

I've got to go now.

Oh, God, Dion.

Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.

What if we're witnessing the end of touch dancing?

He won't tell me, but I've got my suspicions. And I don't want any of that. Don't keep her out late.

It must run in the family.

Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old...  Travels well though.  You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.

I can't do that.

I hate chickens.

Mom, is there any coffee left?

I think I'm way ahead of them.

Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank.

Richard Nixon's going to be President. Nixon wears hats.

Wrong, Dad. Your idea.

I want everybody to hear because I don't have anything to be ashamed of.

The nurse called and said you'd be coming home.

How do you feel?

Of course, dear. You're home now.

I'm confused about a lot of things right now. Charlie's only one of them.

I don't feel very festive.

We've got to move fast. This is an idea whose time has come.

What? When did it happen? Your dad and I always expected you two to get married.

I'm just happy to see you.

Let's do something together.. Do you want to play Monopoly? Or Careers... Clue... Snakes and Ladders?

Look at Kenny Rossi. Isn't he dreamy? I wish he'd break up with Arlene. She thinks she's so great.

You know, you two are wonderful parents. I'm really going to try to behave myself.

Gee. I'm sorry to hear that.

Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.

It really wasn't that difficult.

All right. I'll be in the physics lab. Make it fourthirty. I have a rocket club meeting.

Well... in a Newtonian framework, the possibilities were limited, but with the advent of relativity theory, the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed.

What's that?

I	know what a burrito is.

What's inside?

So you think time travel is possible? For people?

This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years.

That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.

Confucious says, The way out is through the door. There's a truck. There's your door.

I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow. 

How come you never ask me any important questions? Don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? What about your family? What about people?

Come on. You can't be serious.

High tech. I like the sound of that.

Cheer up. Now you can give some other guy a shot. Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht.

No offense, but you're pretty out of it now.

Peggy Sue Kelcher.  Or, Peggy Bodell.  I'm not sure.

I... um...

My God...  ...how is that possible? You have to help me, Doctor Yolander. I don't know what I'm dealing with here! They've dug up my wife...

I suppose so.

--Drew, he's your dog. Are you listening to this?

He's probably going up to the Pet Sematary. Kids've been going out there on Halloween night for years.

I had a little run-in with Zowie.

I'm not hungry.

He did. We buried him.  There's a place out in the woods... if you bury something there, it comes back alive.

All set.

Hey, I'm so sorry I'm not the stud that you are.

What if it's not bullshit? If I bury Zowie there, and it works...  ...he'll come back alive.

You think he'd believe it if he did?

I don't know...  ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you...

Go later...

I don't know what to do, Bob.

Sorry...

K-R-O-one.

Because they deserve to, Walter.

Some people think you have an attitude problem, Beckett.

Yeah. Thanks, guys.

I said, don't worry about it.

A reaction to AZT...

I have too much work to do. Skip the treatment.

CLOSE THE FUCKING LAW BOOK!

Your Honor, I submit there were no complaints until Counselor began knocking on doors, drumming up business. And the dust, which Counselor refers to, has appeared on only three occasions. Each time it has been examined and the results...

Continue.

Continue.

As in, the vegetable?

Look. I know I have a case. If you don't want to take it for personal reasons...

One of the partners spotted a lesion on my forehead.

Thank you.

I had a blood transfusion today. I feel great.

Not bad.

Let's find you a drink.

Charles. Okay. Miller?

Want to hear my favorite aria?

What kind of person is that?

Sure thing.

Get down to Word Processing. Help Jamey look.

Something like that.

Not unnecessary ones.

Gay movies.

It's impossible to know exactly when or how I was infected with HIV.

Answer the question, please.

Thank you.

All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights.

Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department.

Thank you. No more questions.

I'll withdraw.  You were aware, when you worked with Maria Torres, that she had AIDS, correct?

I'll withdraw it. Mr. Beckett? Were you living with Miguel Alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater?

Right.

Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about...

Get real.

Uh.... No. Not really.

That's correct.

We were satisfied.

In a word, yes.

Give me the camera, Joe.

Is there some kind of expression I've picked up from Beckett?! Some kind of fairy attitude I've unconsciously adopted?! Am I walking different?! Some kind of vocal thing?! Have I picked up some kind of homo <u>vibe</u>?!

My lettuce is wilting.

Tell Iris all about it.  Take good care of Mrs. Finley, Iris.  Beckett, come in.

So during those long voyages, months at a time, out to sea, no women in sight, a hundred, hardworking, robust, young men, in the prime of their life, at the peak of their natural appetites, desires, their god- given, hormonal <u>instincts</u>... Anything going on?

How did you do that?

Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services.

I'll take that under consideration, Your Honor.

Very good, Joe. Now, Belinda, I've got a figure over here, of one million, five. I...

Holy Shit. Did you, Bob?

Andy, you don't want this.

Jesus.

Charles...

Lookit. Lookit!

It's a fucking staircase! Go over it! GO OVER IT!

No, we'd never....Oh, God, honey, you shoulda told me sooner.

What're they doing? What're <u>we</u> --

Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."

They're coming.

I got the quick-and-ugly version.

You sure you can keep --

No, you see, I <u>promised</u> them...I have to...I have to go and....

I would try for them.

I think I twisted my ankle running backwards like that. And I'm not sure I can....  Okay, that's a lie. I just don't want to be alone back there anymore. If you could just give me a few minutes up front here --

Little swamp-flu from the Conga system. Never shook it with all this cryo-sleep.

Probably right.

What'd Owens mean? 'Bout not touching the switch?

Promise me. Swear to me you won't --

Like what?

25 kilos each, huh?

We're not sure <u>when</u> it happens, so let's not --

May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' --

-- we need a fail-safe. Bring the cells over at the last possible minute -- when the wings are ready, when we <u>know</u> we're ready to launch.

He's a murderer. The law says he's gotta do his bid.

I never said I was.

And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you <u>born</u> lucky?

I don't get it, Johns. What is so goddamn valuable in your life that you're worried about losing? Huh? Is there anything at all? Besides your next hype?  Got no right to be so scared. Neither one of us.

Stay in the light! Everybody! Stay in the fucking --

He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --

70 seconds! You still got 70 seconds to level this beast out!

Riddick?

And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?

Rain.

Blessing you like the others.  It's painless.

Get the girl back under. Keep going.

Please...this solves nothing...please....

Listen to her? <u>Her</u>? When she was willing to sacrifice us all?

Didn't say that. But least this way I don't have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin' up.

Not staying in here another....

Say that again.

I'm willing to take a cut in pay.

About the girl.

Not if I'm the one.

Nice embellishment.

So which one caught your eye?

Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?

You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?

It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden Zone.  I see you brought along the female of your species.  I didn't realize a man could be monogamous.

Zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone. That's what  we'll try for. What about you?

Zira, come on. You know they can't --  Oh oh. Here comes Number One.

I don't. And I'm not going to try.

Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?

It's probably wrong --

The evidence was very meager --

Right.  Let's put the water and provisions in the wagon.

Any sign of dangerous ionization?

Let's find them all.

Proceed. But don't turn this hearing into a farce.

Very well. I suggest we go and look at them.

I admit, I know nothing of your culture.

Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?

We're here to stay.

We're some three hundred and twenty light years from Earth. On an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of Orion.  That could be Bellatrix.

Sorry...  I was thinking of Stewart. What d'you suppose happened?

You don't seem very cut up about it.

long pause) You know it.

Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.

What would you learn? I've told you where you are and when you are.

There's only one reality left. We're here and it's now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead.

Don't bother

But I'm not prepared to die.

Zira doesn't want your female.

Keep moving. We can't turn back now.

A man, Dr. Maximus.

Why special?

My name is Taylor.

By your leave, Mr. President -- the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.

Then why is he called the accused Your Honors must think him guilty of something.

Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man?

Let us assume, as common sense dictates, that the prisoner's story is false. But if he does not come from another planet, then surely he sprang from our own. Yes, sprang.  As an animal psychologist, I have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute.

Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death.

My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system.

I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.

I don't know.

All right, let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test.

Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?

Don't look for it, Taylor. You may not like what you find.

Shhhh!

Yes.

She's not sick at all.  She's pregnant.

Yes, Sir.

This is his assertion.

He doesn't know.

He won't survive.  Do you know what sort of life awaits you out there, Taylor? That of an animal. If you aren't eventually hunted down and killed by apes, some jungle beast will devour you.

Where?

How the hell did he get away?

Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.

Yeah, they had claymores strung up in the trees, blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces. BAAD SHIT.

Yeah, what is it?

I'm talking to you Red and I'm telling you no. Get back to your position.

...everybody gotta die sometime Red... Get back to your foxhole.

Tricky bitch, reason you gimme dat turkey loaf is nobody else can eat that shit 'cept me so don't start your game playing with me Junior.

Just 'member take it easy now, don't think too much, don't be a fool, no such thing as a coward cause it don't mean nuthin. Jes keep on keepin' on. Okay my man...

They don't know shit Barnes, and chances are we gonna run into something.

They're on their way...  There's a gook village half a klik downriver, Battalion wants us to move in and search it ASAP, something's going on... where's Barnes?

This ain't Taylor. Taylor been shot. This man Chris been resurrected...

Merle? Jesus!... Patty?

Barnes gets killed, his jaws'd go on clacking...

Baaaa! Fuck it, they sold us out - so what! What'd you'all expect? Civilian life is phoney BULLSHIT man. They're ROBOTS man - watchin' dopey television and drivin' dopey cars, and they fuck up, nobody dies. That's all right, you keep fuckin' up, politicians keep lyin'. Cause it don't really matter. Don't mean shit. So what! Whatcha want - a parade! Fuck that too! No war time no grunt never got no respect. Till he was dead - and even THEN! You're fighting for YOURSELF man! You're fighting for your SOUL, dat's all. Remember dat. And it's some goddamn battle too - if you'se a man, wrestle with that angel...  ...Love and Hate - the whole shitbang show, that's the story then and now and it ain't hardly gonna change...

Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.

That's right. I don't want to hear about it 'cause to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit okay... I just don't give a shit anymore.

I'm going to Vancouver, Mr. Mitchell.



Not tonight.

If you change your mind about the cocktail party, or anything else, give me a buzz.

How long would that take?

Possibly, Miss.

Bank?

What did you say his name was?

As I said before...

No.  Are you really going to drink that stuff?

I can be talked out of it. As a matter of fact, I'd like a dry Martini myself.

On a train. He said he lived here, and he offered to make a reservation for me.

You didn't have to tell him that.

Couldn't be.

All right--following me.

So have I.

No percentage in that.

They'll look for you.

And Betty Mayfield--

But that's what I'm doing.  Couldn't they think of that?

You leave it.

That man that was following us last night--he didn't come back this morning.  I'm beginning to wonder about him, too.  Was he really following me--or you?

He'll come back...They always come back when you give them money.

You-killed-him?

So that I will never be found.

Every day of your life you'll want me.  You'll never get over it. Every time you see your face in the mirror--

I don't know her.. or particularly want to.

I'm sorry, that's all there is.

Stop saying you're sorry. I want information, not regrets.

A graduation present.

Deep blue? I'd call it grey-blue.

We wouldn't have met at all.

There must be-- but when I'm with you I can't find it.

Jeff.  Shall we go now, Jeff, and get it over with?

Looking for peanuts, I suppose.

I always wear gloves when I shoot people.  A bad joke--but better than tears.

I know that.

There's an empty taxi across the street.  If you're so anxious, take it.  He'll know the way to the police headquarters.

We know everything.

I understand, Betty.  I understand perfectly.

$40 a day and expenses. Expenses run pretty high on a case like this. I'm a long way from home. I don't have a B.C. Licence. I'd need about $500 for a retainer.

Quit trying to scare me, Mr. Brandon, I'm neurotic.

For two hundred?

Got the information on you?

In the same elevator. It is a public conveyance.

Sometimes.

Leave that one lay.

I've got good ears.

I don't like to be tailed. The lady I'm with doesn't like to be stared at. To put the matter in a couple of nutshells, I don't like you.

A private joke.

She doesn't look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train.

On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside the chaise, I picked it up. Don't ask me why. I ought to know better.

I never notice the view after the first week.

Doesn't answer the question.

Or just drunk enough.  He was with her when she registered.  He knew where her room was.  You were out most of the evening.  There was a lot of mess to clean up . Waiters coming and going, the door standing open.  Suppose Mitchell came in to grab a drink for himself, then wandered out on this balcony, then realized betty's balcony was just below yours.

The liquors lovely. The rest of the party you can have.

Lay off, can't you?

How would you know, Brandon?

How clumsy. I'd never forgive myself. Good night my dear.

I'm an Irishman, sir.  An Irishman is always logical.

I'd suggest a telegram.  Something like this: Chief of Police, San Francisco.  A licensed private detective named named Martin J. Goble, address so-and-so, has been found murdered within our jurisdiction.  His partner, name something-something Greer, refuses to give us any information. Correction.  Refuses information necessary to our investigation. Can you assist?  Signed Detective Sergeant Driscoll, Vancouver, British Columbia, Police. 

Would you?

How important would it have to be? It's only murder, Inspector.

You get it's brother.

I hate to pull rank on you Sergeant, but once in a while...for moral purposes...you might address me as "Inspector". In moments of extreme desperation, you might even call me "sir".

If she didn't--if luck was against him--he wipes the gun off, reaches the wall up there--drops it on the chaise.

Not quiet yet.

I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains.  Why don't you ask her about the gun?

I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her.

I'll investigate Mr. Clarendon's financial position--

How about Magruder?

She might.

How do you do, sir.

She's a suspect, naturally.  But not the only one.

Aye.  You have a point there.

I disagree, sir.  As Inspector in charge of the case I have the right to form that opinion, the right to act on it.

Identification on possible, Sir. Not conclusive.

Not too far, I hope.

You ought to know why.

Splendid. Now she can return the compliment.

You know what would happen to you if I turned these over to the police?

I seem to recognize this routine. First the kiss then the touch.  Oh, what's the use. You're you.

Oh, forget it. Clark Brandon's throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening. Take me?

He was delightful.

Well, I am a great admirer of your work.  I read your books on Chartism when I was still at school.  I'm a journalist, not a historian.  There are questions of method, and approach.  I wondered--

Yes.

To James.  I remember what it was I was going to say.  We were talking about forgetfulness.  The Czech writer Kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting.

Yes.

She's fine.  Well, actually we've broken up.  It's all over.

Look, I'd rather you didn't ask me questions.  I can't talk about it.

Of course.

Freshman and sophomores...

And to history.

I think it went on rather too long.

Two or three years ago I would have stayed.  And fucked you.

I don't trust anyone.  That's what comes of working in television.

Why not.

No jokes.  James is in love.

Let me see.

We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.

Will it be fun?

You're a piece of shit

Hello.

All right.

I'm not here.

I dunno.  Ploughman's Lunch.

Now listen...

Two years of surgery.  I missed my window.  Limped through law school instead.

Where?

I know that part.  Tell me something I can use, here.

Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--

She'll be fine, Rosie won't do anything.  At least not as long as I meet him at a certain place and time, about... let's see...  ... six hours from now.

Sorry, can't do it, brah.  He's on the road.  And where they're going there's no phones.  Damn, I hate this Johnny, I really do.  I hate violence.  See, that's why I need Rosie.  I could never make this thing work, myself.  No way I could hold a knife to Tyler's throat, man! She was my woman, once.  We shared time in this world.  But Rosie, he's kind of a... mechanism.  Once you set him in motion, he won't stop. That's his gift, a kind of... blankness.  Noon comes, straight up, he'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes.  Nothing I can do, unless I get there.

There's nobody else here...

That's the point, isn't it?

The shit they pull, huh?

Yeah, they control the room well. Stick strictly to the cash drawers.

Yeah.  That was thirty years ago anyway.  L.A.'s changed a lot since then. The air got dirty and the sex got clean.  So you want to nail the Ex- Presidents?  Be a big hero?

Angelo, this stuff is for little rubber people who don't shave yet.

Got it...

No.  But let's do it, anyway.  It's gonna bug the shit out of Harp.

This Zen master surfer.

Sure.  No problem.  I'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious.  Shit, he'll probably call out the National Guard.

Nothing.

Figured you did.

What are you talking about?

Swell's here, Johnny.  Bodhi always knows.

Warm them up.

Wait!  Jesus Christ!  You're fucking crazy, you know that? You go in there you're gonna eat it on the rocks.  Here, follow me.

What about the rest of Hopper's men?

Something... in the trees...

No way, old buddy.

You never were all that smart... let's go!!!

Probably another rebel patrol. They operate in here all the time.

The wound all fused, cauterized... what the hell did this?

Right behind you.

We found 'em both, dead. And the gear from the chopper. If they're Central American, I'm a fuckin' Chinaman. By the looks of 'em, I'd say our cabinet minister and his aide are CIA.  Another thing, Major, we were lucky... couple of those guys we waxed are Russians, military advisors by the look of it. Something big was about to happen here.

Thank you, Sergeant.

The best friend I ever had.

Hawkins?

Philip!  We'll need shoes!

But I do know.  I also know your lines of credit are over-extended. If I don't buy your company, someone else will...  Ah, the escargot.

No.

I see.  Well.  Maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then.

Who indeed...

I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing.  Even the pension funds are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks.

<u>Expected</u>... offer.

Sure.  For five bucks.

Sit... and spin.

Not exactly.

Yeah, I peed in the fountain there once.  Give me a break.

It pays.

Day jobs, yeah.  I've tried them.  Turn right.

Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.

Fine.

Do you plan everything?

I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look.

I've known a lot of everybody.

They should be.  They're both good at it.

Oooh, thank god.

Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.

Just a romantic, that's you.

You didn't wake me.  I'll be out of here in a minute.

I like guys if that's what you're asking.  Not that I trust'm.

"Occupational hazard".

There, see?  Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.

I got a dress, yeah.

... all right.  I'll meet you in the lobby.  But only cause you're paying me to.

Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business.

Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  It works.

Thank you.  I would.  Nice.

No.

He's good at what he does.

Shall we mingle?

Vivian, what the --

Huh?

Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take.

When I was a little girl, my mother locked me in the attic when I was bad, which was pretty often. I'd stare out the window up there and make believe I was a princess trapped in the tower by the wicked queen.  Then suddenly a knight on a white horse with his bright colors flying would ride up. Rescue me from the tower, and then we'd ride off... but never, ever in all the times I had that dream did the knight say, "Come on baby, I'll put you up in a great condo."

It was good.

Thank you.

Really?  Some high class gold digger who speaks French better than I do?  No, thank you.  I just got off the phone with one.

You shouldn't go alone.  He might claim that you tried to black mail him.

But, Edward...

Bill Stuckey, Vivian.  My wife, Elizabeth.

Industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?

Goodbye, Bill.

Why?

Yes.

Hi, Viv.  Carlos, you know my roommate, Viv.

Okay.  I'm sorry I said your dream was stupid.

In Beverly Hills?

Baby!  Rodeo Drive.

Was that you?

What do you know?  You look <u>good</u>. All dressed up.  You clean up real nice.  You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard, lookin' like you do.  Not that you ever did anyway.

Dummy.

Go for the bucks.

Get a job and probably go back to school.  Figure out what I'm gonna be.

No.  You took care of rent, that's enough.

I'm gonna pay you back next time I see ya, babe.  Just wait, I'm gonna do something real nice for you some day.

Okay.

And who is that?

That's all right.  I'm sure they're quite lovely.

But I always eat like this.

Excuse me?

I swear it will be done.

I-would-not-say-such things-if- Iwere-you-

I do not marry tonight.

I was giving you a chance. No matter where you take me ... there's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck. He could track a falcon on a cloudy day. He can find you

You admit to me you do not love your fiance?

"Are not capable of love" is what you mean.

I know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything.

Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I done?

As you wish.

Of course you will.

This is true love. You think this happens every day?

You? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.

Now, was that so terrible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64.

Gently.

What hideous sin have you committed lately?

I believe you -- So what happens now?

You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people?

Well, I haven't fought just one person for so long. I've been specializing in groups. Battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing.

You never said anything about killing anyone.

Anybody want a peanut?

What do I do?

That leaves twenty for me. At my best, I could never defeat that many.  I need Vizzini to plan. I have no gift for strategy. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           82.

But you don't know where he is.

I have a little.

What's the difference?  We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him.

We had Miracle Max make a pill to bring you back.

Right, right, sorry.

Oh. Well, thank you very much. It's very nice of you. Your vote of confidence is overwhelming. All right.  The Princess Bride, by S. Morgenstern. Chapter One. Buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of Florin.

-- murdered by pirates is good --

What is it? What's the matter? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           56.

Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.

You want me to read this or not?

I don't understand.

Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           90.

Okay.  All right, now, let's see. Where were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of Despair.

I wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right --

Yes.

Tyrone, you know how much I love watching you work. But, I've got my country's five hundredth anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, My wife to murder, and Guilder to frame for it. I'm swamped. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           75.

Let me explain --  -- No, there is too much. Let me sum up.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           99.

True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it?  Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside.

Have you ever considered piracy? You'd make a wonderful Dread Pirate Roberts.

Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?

He's already dead.

Sheesh! I never worked for so little, except once, and that was a very noble cause. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           93.

Look who knows so much. Well, it just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead. There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Please open his mouth.

What's that?

That is a noble cause. Give me the sixty-five, I'm on the job.

That does put a damper on our relationship.

No good. I've known too many Spaniards.

Nothing comes to mind.

My father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man. He was a great swordmaker, my father. And when the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job. He slaved a year before he was done.

You are ready, then?

You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.

Thank you -- I've worked hard to become so.

I ought to be after twenty years.

No one of consequence.

I don't swim. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.

Morons.

Australia.

I'll tell you in a minute. First, let's drink -- me from my glass, and you from yours.

You only think I guessed wrong --  -- that's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned. You fool.

I'm not a witch, I'm your wife. But after what you just said, I'm not even sure I want to be that anymore.

Nobody's hearing nothing!

A good hour. Yeah.

It would take a miracle. Bye!

He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.

That's genius.  That's genius. Roger, I think I speak for Mr. Bloom and myself when I say that you're the only man in the world who can do justice to SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER.

"I want to croon,

Mr. Bialystock ...

Why should they find out?  It's only two thousand dollars,  Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around.  You can do it. You're an accountant.  The word 'count' is part of your title.

All right.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.

Aaaaaaaaaa!

I don't know.  Let's see.  We've had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green.

Yes.  That's it.  Happy.  Well, whatta ya think of that.  Happy.

You found a flop!

Shut up, you idiot.  He's a harmless nut.  Play along with him.  It's almost in the bag.

Look, I'm just not wearing this arm band.  I don't care how big the deal is.

No way out.  No way out.  What?  Who?

Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you.

What???

Liebkind, no!

With whom?

We swear it!

You crazy lunatic!  What are you shooting at us for?  Why don't you use this  where it will do us some good?  Why don't you shoot the actors?  Liebkind, have I ever steered you wrong?

No.  We go. 

You can count on me-o, you dirty young man.

Oooh.  I love it.  Hold me, touch me.

I don't know what's happening to me. I must be getting old.

The Blue Max...

"Deutchland, Deutchland ... "

OH.  "I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy, Yankee Doodle is my ... " Listen, this is not place to talk.  Come! 

Stop!  Stop!  This is insanity.

Where are you going vit the light?

Oh, sing.  Sing!

We won.

I'm looking for a missing person.  My name's Arbogast, private investigator...  Trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week. From Phoenix.  It's a private matter... family wants to forgive her...  She isn't in trouble.

No. No one has stopped here in weeks...

What?

I didn't lie to you. I just have trouble keeping track of... time.

Of which morning?

Or arrived with her.

Or if she had you say... gallantly protecting her... you wouldn't be fooled... you'd know she was just using you. Wouldn't you?

I didn't mean that as a slur on your manhood. I'm sorry.

Your mother met her?  Can I talk to your mother?

Wouldn't have been able to tail you if you did.

Sam, they don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back. It was all in cash...

I don't care if you do or... I want to see Mary... before she gets in any deeper...

Of course not. Please.

Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?

She ain't missing so much as she's run away.

Like what?

Just what he told your detective.

Lila.

You might have doubted for say five minutes or so, Sister.

I think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don't you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here.

Patience doesn't run in our family. Sam, I'm going out there!

Just wait here?

Sam.

Where could he have gone?

Does that mean we can't...

Of course we will.

I'm going with you. But we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in...

The bathroom. Look at how clean it is. The one in our cabin is clean... but this is clean!

Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?

I could stand something regular.

It is tragic! Or it will be... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here...

You couldn't be a criminal if you committed a major crime.

We can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!

I haven't even been married once yet!

Don't miss your plane.

Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.

Thank you, Mr. Bates.

No.

I'd like to.

Friends? Who needs friends.  A boy's best friend is his mother.  You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?

A son is a poor substitute for a lover. 

It's too late for me. And besides... who'd look after her? She'd be alone up there, the fire would go out... damp and cold, like a grave. When you love someone, you don't do that to them, even if you hate them. Oh, I don't hate her.  I hate... what she's become. I hate... the illness.

I am sorry. I only felt... it seemed she was harming you. I meant...

Norman.

I'd like to, but...

Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes...

Of course not! Am I acting as if... something's wrong?

I'm sorry.

You must remember that bad business out there. About ten years ago...

I suppose you want a cabin.

Haven't any.

Yes, matter of fact.  The wife's taking a nap and... I can never keep quiet enough for her... so I thought I'd look you up and... talk.

Fine.

Yes.

I don't know what you've been saying.

This detective was out there and Norman told him about the girl and the detective thanked him and went away.

Yes! In the house behind the motel. I pounded and called but she... just ignored me.

Never mind your theories. Was she ever conscious?

No, not exactly. Why the great anxiety? It must be something important.

Sure, got thousand cats, too. Look at 'em-- Points to cages of cats.

You found Buckley?

Yes. Mr. Buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. He's in the hospital. How about it?

He isn't here.

I'm losing my blood!

Yes!

I don't think you could have a real affair. You couldn't care for anyone.

You would.

You think money is the only requisite. It happens that the poor people are happier.

I'll have it for supper.  So long.

I can't convince the inner woman that we can wait. She's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on Santa Claus and the other dummies. I've only had a cup of coffee since last night.

Delighted, I'm sure. 

I'm not quarreling, only ...

Thank you.

And he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. Let him think it was his fault ... He should be along very shortly .. . But be very stern before you forgive him, especially if it is your fault  ...  While you're waiting for your friend, would you like to see some new figures I have downstairs?

And I have no desire to hurt you. You will always be beautiful. Think, my child, in a thousand years you will be as lovely as you are now.

That you're a sure bet to place in the bread line. There's no room on this rag for the purely ornamental. You're easy on the eyes and pretty conceited about it.

Well, is it my fault if nothing happens?

If this kid was some unknown soda jerker, they wouldn't have pinched him. But he's George Winton and they're playing him up. It's a Roman holiday for every paper hat editor in New York.

Well, anyway, he couldn't have copped that body -- he was in jail.

Or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.

Nope, I'm through!

So you can give me an argument and tell me I'm wrong. Don't be sil, Kid.

Oh, by the way, another pet theory of yours just blew up.

That dear, innocent Judge Ramsey that you were so sure got bumped off for knowing too much has been located in South America.

No foolin' -- any suspect?

Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ...

Hotcha! Saved, one job!

It's all yours.

He's not a stag hound. His name is Kelly and he's a police dog.

Ain't that something. The mad monk of Manhattan. Here goes nothing.  Listen to the animal cracker roar like a lion.

Gee, honey-bunch, I'm sorry -- I'm going to have to disappoint you.

No use. He's a crab, I tell you.

They didn't give me a chance. We had a couple of drinks and she was all right then. She seemed happy.

Stolen! What are you trying to do to me? ... You're working with the police! ... You're trying to make me say something that can be used against me! You're trying ...

You go in for dangerous things.

You don't believe me. You think I'm just talking. Will you marry me?

That is unfortunate.

That doesn't seem so bad to me. What is wrong with it?

But the composition as a whole -- I've tried to keep a sketchy freedom.

That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.

Yes, sir, it's here on the truck, but it's pretty heavy -- I'll need help.

Good. Well, I'll be seeing you.

You taking any medication?

You did.

What universe are you in, Paul?

Is Rose here?

But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.

Nobody.

Your Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll say that. He's the best and most kind-hearted man in the world.

You know, that Daddy of yours is the funniest man, the things he says, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth next.

But Rose...

Yeah, I'd believe it.

You won't die, Rose.

Okay.

What are you going to do, Rose?

Five hundred rabbits?

No. Why should Rose be in my room?

Well, I don't know.  No, I don't know, Daddy, I think the rain has obscured it.

You mean confirmed, Mother. I didn't confirm it before. I would have had to confirm it previously, in order for it to be reconfirmed.

What did you say, Brother?

No.

I think Daddy suspects.

Yeah.

Okay.

Let me look.  Aww-rr...

Shut up, Doll. I'll cut your guts

Then why does she act so dumb?

That's the least of her troubles. Rose had a rare tropic disease and the little tubes in her that babies swim down are all stopped up, she told me all about it.

Hello, Daddy. How are you?

It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch.

Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow?

Yeah, I know, he was up here. It's pitiful like you say. When he lost Rose it ruined the man, it destroyed him totally when he lost Rose.

No, son, she is dead.

I am afraid so, son. About a week ago. Her husband phoned me, she had asked him to call me if anything happened.

She was fifty-six, son. Of course she didn't look it, nowhere near it. The cancer came back, I'm afraid I fibbed about that. But it was very quick, son. She was in the hospital only two weeks, and the last week she didn't know anything.

That's all I want to know.  Lets get out of here before I get the epizootics myself. Thank you, Doctor, for your discourse, it was fascinating, no doubt.

Any major operation is dangerous. However, as we know from her previous illness, she's a very strong girl.

First, about the girl's history. Evidently she's been very promiscuous since early childhood, she has no control over her sexual impulses. Furthermore, she is permanently barren, she can't have children.

You're not having lunch?

She will succeed.

That farmer in Gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her, and I'm beginning to see why.

What time is it?

Rose, my patience is wearing thin. First a scruffy man who runs like a deer and now a sulky boy who wont go away. This is getting to be a regular monkey and dog show.

Scoundrels? They weren't scoundrels, they were just boys.

Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!

It isn't her fault if she's popular... what?

Who is to say our morals are better than hers?  But maybe you're right. She could... influence Dolly...

But morals come from the heart, not from rigid rules and empty laws. And in her heart Rose has never hurt anyone and she never would. Therefore, she's not immoral. Not really.

Just a moment, dear.  We can't have it, Rose. Can you behave yourself -- or not? That is the question, to behave or not to behave, to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous chastity and keep your skirt down or to hoist it in the light of the moon and make whoopee -- that is the coil shuffling question.  If you can't behave I am going to fire you and I say it in front of you and Mrs. Hillyer and I mean it. I point my rigid finger right at your nose, Rose, and I stare unwaveringly into your big blue eyes and I tell you... this is a final warning. Do you hear me?

She can't get a job, it's a depression. And we can't just throw her out on the street.

No, she doesn't, she's fine, fine. She's perfectly healthy, don't give her ideas.

That's why I'm asking her who the father is. It's the most vital question of all. Who's the father, dear?

Fine.

Who?

Well, yes, she's happy. Of course Dave doesn't have her life force, not at all. There isn't much furniture in his house, just a table and one or two chairs, whereas Rose has furniture coming out of the windows.

Um-hmmuhh. I never drink a whole cup, my nerves can't stand the caffeine. Ehh-hh, Lord awful insomnia in reverse last night. Lay there and sweated blood for hours.

My rose. It's kind of like a motto. People will say, there comes Rose with her rose.

Yes, sir.

It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie, don't you remember me?

Page proof of a book I'm working on.

Dave Schapiro is no horse doctor and Rose has been a good wife to him for a long time. To call her a nymphomaniac is the most stupid thing I ever heard in my life.

She looks terrible, just awful.

It is kind of amazing. The dentist says she has perfect teeth, there isn't a cavity in her mouth.

What do you mean, what kind of gobbledygook talk is that?

Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.

Well, I am working on my thesis.

Doll, you and Waski run on, too.

Be quiet, Rose.

I don't want to. When I was lyin' there in that hospital bed at death's door I says to myself, I ain't goin' out no more. If I ever get outta this, I'll just stay home.

I'm not hungry. I can't eat nothin', I haven't been able to eat since I got fired. I think maybe I'm sick.

Rose, really, you shouldn't act like that.

Well... well, that's wonderful, Rose.

I'm looking at this poster, and I'm thinkin', I don't remember seeing films like this when I was in school.

Maybe I'm not making myself clear. You're probably the first girl Billy-Boy's ever fallen in love with, and I know for sure you're the first he's slept with.  So, how's he gonna feel...  ... when he finds out that the only first he is for you is the first guy who didn't have to pull out at the last second to get his close-up?

I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.

Now you know what to watch for...

Hey, listen... I'll give you something else, Kittle.  Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach?  It was never identified...

I'm telling you, you're barking up the wrong tree.

She's fine, as if you cared.

Jeez... it's too early in the morning for this.  Leave off.  Here's your paper.

I'd rather you guys didn't do this again.

I can not even begin to imagine how much that must have hurt.

Lots of these pencil-pushers work out of their homes.  It's a tax dodge.

Yeah.

Clench your teeth so when we land you don't accidentally bite off your tongue.

Entertainers don't count.

Wha... ?

What was I supposed to do?

We have to find Kittle.

This is the police lock-up.  We're police.  How can we steal from ourselves?

If we don't catch a break soon, we're gonna be left standing with our dicks in our hands.

Go wherever you want.  Live how you want.

You going rogue on me?

Well, shake a leg.  Get these files downstairs...  And, quit listening to your fucking voodoo music.

Just wanted to make you aware... before today's over, we'll be standing on top of your mountain of horse and pissing down on you.

You bust some small-time pimps, whores and dime-bag junkies, like the world's a better place because you're in it.  And for what, Kittle... two hundred and fifty dollars a week? Tell me, how does anyone get so self-rightious when they can barely afford to pay their rent?

I insist.  What will it be?  Boston Tea Party Clam Chowder, or maybe the Chicken Red, White and Cordon Bleu? No...  There's a special on the menu, today only...  ... <U>roasted</U> <U>pig</U>.

"Today you have a rare opportunity to make a big difference in your chosen field.  By your able leadership and with great conviction and strength of character, you will come up a winner."

First of all, the Constitution wasn't writtem till 1787...

Don't crowd him.

No, we are <U>not</U> going to do that.

Is there nothing in this world you enjoy more than the sound of your own voice?

He's right.  We hit the bricks, we walk back triple-fucked.

Nothing's broke.  Keep sewing.  And quit pacing, you big ox.  You're making me skittish.

Gimmie a minute.

Sounds good.

Seatbelts fastened, please.

All right. Stand by.

You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.

Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.

She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!

Who are you?

You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.

How are we doing?

I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.

Yeah, she's comin' up.

We got separated.

It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.

He wasn't. I can feel it.

All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!

We shall double our efforts.

Here goes nothing.

Quiet.

Your father?

No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.

But, why must you confront him?

I know, father.

I will not fight you.

Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.

Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?

Oh come on, Brad, admit it.  It was enjoyable, wasn't it?  There's no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure.

I told you, my car broke down.

Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.

You are - so quake with fear, you tiny fools.

Janet.

Made me give you the eye And then panic,

I really loved the skilful way You beat the other girls To the bride's bouquet.

Dammit, Janet.

Just a moment, Janet.  They may have a telephone.

Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.

Say!  Do any of you guys know the Madison?

Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.

Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors. And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I - ah - wondered if you could help us.  Our car has broken down about two miles up the road.  Do you have a phone we might use?

Yes.

You must leave now Dr Scott while it's still possible.  We are about to beam the entire house back to the planet of transexual in the galaxy of Transylvania. Go now.

Nothing.  Why, do you think I should?

Cross my heart and hope to die.

From Transexual Transylvania.

So come up to the Lab.

Oh my, my,

Sha la la la That ain't no crime.

No.  You've arrived on a rather special night.  It's one of the master's affairs.

...Fine.

Ain't skated since I was fifteen -- That's when I started fightin' -- gotta watch the ankles. Yeah, fightin' use to be tops with me, but no more. All I wanted to prove was I weren't no bum -- That I had the stuff to make a good pro.

...I suppose.

Morning after?

Yes.

I don't think I belong here.

No... Sharp -- You look great.

I gotta go out for a while.

Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.

It's not your house --

What?!

Southpaw, nuthin' -- I'll drop 'im in three -- 'Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion.' Shhiii -- Sounds like a damn monster movie!!

Sure -- He can hit -- Don't play no more -- Stick an' move, hear?

People nothin', you in a fight, my man, -- ya best believe what you hear... Knock that boy out soon an' let's go home.

You're hurtin', man!

Any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls?

Does that bum have to say that?

Move your shoulders down.

Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody.

It ain't your fault -- I originally done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight.  That's me fightin' Big Baby Crenshaw -- Big Baby was the size of an airplane an' I broke my hands on his head -- I lost, but it's a nice picture, don't ya think?

This guy is beautiful -- get the Cokes.

Yeah -- My ol' man who was never the sharpest told me -- I weren't born with much brain so I better use my body.

I must be goin' deaf 'cause I thought ya said, 'ten cents.'

There's no way Apollo expected this kind of hitting power.

Mr. Gazzo wants the two hundred now!

That's it, I'm broke.

Waits! -- Be smart. Ya don't have to break nothin' -- Here, take my coat, it's worth fifty-sixty dollars. It's yours.

He's always in a bad mood.  Count ya blessin's. Ya a healthy person -- ya legs work -- ya hands work --

Yeah.

Black market?

...Thanks.

I wouldn't take no cheap shots. I'd be a good sparrin' partner.

Sure, an' I'm smart enough to know that no sparrin' partner should take cheap shots at the Champ. He's just there to help condition the man.

Hey --

What?

I won't.

I was talkin' with ya man, Mike. -- Hey, how come I been put outta my locker?

...Tomato?

...No.

Yeah, sure.

Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.

Freak luck is a strange thing.

I done it all. I've done an' seen everything'. Believe what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya shoulda seen the night in Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny' Russo outta the ring, September 14, 1923 -- same night Firpo knocked Dempsey outta the ring. But who got the Press? He did. He had a manager -- September 14, 1923.

I asked, but ya never helped nothin'! -- Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance.

Yo, Benny.

Thanks, Mick -- I'm gonna try.

See what?

It ain't your locker no more.

My sister's a friggin' loser.

I hate the friggin' game... I'd like to talk some business.

Look at my hands -- See how the joints are swollen.

Maybe another job is the best thing.

Gazzo's gotta come to you.

Keep this job, ya eat better.

Yo, what's with you? -- It was suppose to be private.

So where is it then?

Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?

Would this be the same dame who's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out I've got her money.

You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.

What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks.

I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.

Thanks for the vote of confidence.

He's a Toon... who cares?

What the hell would they want with a gag factory?

I'll bet.

That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?

They?

Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk to him.

You're a very stubborn man, Mr. Valiant.  Very pig-headed.  Boys, show Mr. Valiant how we handle pig-headed men at the Toontown station...

Yes, and for that you're charged with aiding and abetting.  But we'll let Santino handle that.

That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.

Toon cops worked me over.

Toons aren't given imperfections.

If I'm as bad as you think, what's stopping me from just killing you right now?

Why didn't you tell me?

That's how he gets rid of the troublemakers.  It's a combination of acetone, turpentine and paint remover. He calls it the...  Final Solution.

Have you got the will?

Divorce?  Never!

Aah!

Well, Acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club.  It was gone in the morning when the cops found the body.

Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.

If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin' from the law with a Toon?

We can't do anything till it's dark.

Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?

A Toon?  Noooo.

Get away from there.

Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage.

From this box here...

Tush, thou art deceived. Hast thou no letters to me from the priest? [Balthsasr shakes his head no.] No matter. Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight. I will hence tonight.

Romeo will answer it?

Am I like Such a fellow?

Of love?

At thy good heart's oppression.

Soft! I will go along; An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.

Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?

Content thee, gentle cuz, content thee. Let him alone; I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement: Therefore be patient, take no note of him

I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.

Here is my gold. Worse poison to men's souls, than these poor compounds that thou mayest not sell.

I have been feasting with mine enemy, where on a sudden one hath wounded me, that's by me wounded; both our remeidies within thy help and holy physic lies.

O deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness! This is dear mercy and thou sees it not. Hence!

Romeo, come forth.

Madam, I am here. What is your will?

Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.

I am a-weary, give me leave awhile: Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I!

Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! O, my back! Other' other side,--O, my back.

Then hie you hence to Father Laurence' cell; There stays a husband to make you a wife

Ahhh!

O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

A man, young lady! Lady, such a man As all the world- -why, he's a man of wax.

Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.

I dream'd a dream to-night.

Peace, good Mercutio, peace! Thou talk'st of nothing.

Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.

Consort? What does thou make us minstrels? An thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing of discords. Here's my fiddlestick. Here's that shall make you dance! Zounds, Consort!

I am for you.

Bid her to come to confession this afternoon; And there she shall at Father Laurence' cell Be shrived and married.

Sir. Ah, sir. Death the end of all

Is that right?

When this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show.  And I don't believe you'd be running this show if you didn't know what was going on.

I don't want you dead, woman, I want the the truth!

So where do you go from here?

The deal?  The deal is we leave for Nice at first light.

And then...

Budweiser?  You talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention Budweiser in the same sentence?  That's not beer!  Christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss.

Now there's the Deirdre I know.

That's him.

Shut up!!!  Shut up and drive!  I'm your superior officer and you will do as I goddamn well say, is that understood?!?

Nobody's saying they don't.

I don't know...  Well I don't!  It's a goddamned mystery to me just like it is to you.  But I do know who we're working for.  My people, and the Russian mob.

Not likely.  Once, yeah, I was -- but there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my meaning.  I'm a hired gun, same as the rest of you, and that's all any of us needs to know about the other.

Don't do it, Sam!

I'll destroy whatever's in the case.

But you hate each other!

What I do is none of your concern.  What you should do is wait for my next phone call.  I'm going to find a place where I can tilt the field in my favor.  When I'm ready, I'll call you and tell you what I want you to do.

There is one other thing...

Call it a reckoning of character.

I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.

Not for long.

My way is better.

Fine with fucking me, we got work to do. I don't care what it takes, we are getting our property back and putting it into the hands of the people who are gonna pay us a great deal of money when we do.  I don't know about the rest of you guys, but I'm not the kind of guy to just sit back and take it in the ass.  I don't mean that in, like, a literal way...

What a surprise...

Who the fuck died and appointed you food czar?

And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?

It's consider a virtue in some corners of the world.

Coordinate what?

As in, they own it?

I don't.  But the language he's speaking is universal.

Jujitsu.

I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.

So is the woman.

You weren't around when I woke up, I thought maybe something had happened.  This has been one very fucked up job, Sam, and I'm not taking any more chances on anybody...  Including you...

I won't lie -- there have been times when I had to do it, times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didn't.

Not necessarily.  He could go off road at any number of places.  He might not even be in the country anymore.

Not exactly.

This doesn't involve you, don't you understand?  I can't even guarantee you any money out of all this.

You see the bullet?

I know of him.

It's my job.

I was waiting to see what would happen. I didn't want to kill him if I didn't have to.

I would have tried not to.  But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have.

I don't know...

If I'm going to die for the CIA, I'm going to go out smoking.  Besides, there's half a forest between us and them, they can't see a goddamned thing.

What of it?  Samurai pain in the ass.

I don't know.  Nobody knows, except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us.  There's probably a couple of guys back at the Company who know, but I don't think they plan to tell me anytime soon.

How is it these fellahs managed to get the drop on us?

You slept with the fucker!!

I might know where you could get a copy.

The Russian would be easier.

Dwayne listen to me -

They're out of towners... Arizona plates...

Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?

At the expense of six people.

Well, we won't do any of that shit!

What are you gonna do?

That's not what I mean.

That guy was a Federal agent. An officer of the law, just like us.

Oh, right, with a little help from his pals Booth and Earl.  I'm sure that's gonna fly real far when they hear that tape...

What are you thinking?

Listen.  Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.

All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this!

Well doesn't he?  Besides if the DEA heard that tape we'd be behind bars right now.  Just call it the cost of doing business.  This whole thing is screwed up.  I'm thinking.  Maybe we should tell 'em the truth...

All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape.  We'll set him up somehow.

He's a partner now, Earl, like it or not.

Well I mean it this time.  Come on.  Let's get this over with!

Yeah, I mean you're coming unglued, Jesse.

If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!

How badly do you want that money?! How bad do you want to stay out of jail?

I don't know!  Shit, give me a break!

We're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves!

Come on. Booth grabs the bag --

Then we're screwed.

He killed her...he killed her...

It's not about the money anymore. Can't you see that?  It's about

Rock solid.

We're going to wait.  All of us, until everything dies down.

What are you proposing?

None of us like it!

Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!

And I'd take it out on him.

There isn't gonna be a next time. We're gonna get out of here.

Great...

He doesn't slobber, he just snores. And I told you we haven't...done anything in over a year.

It'd have to be Switzerland to make sure Dwayne never finds us.

I love you Sally.

What did he buy?

Yeah.

Don't worry the real men are in charge now.

Cause we got footprints leading into that brush, I want to see where it leads...  Jesus, seven dead.  I'll tell you I've never seen carnage like this in all my seventeen years of sheriffing these parts.  I don't like it.  Not in my jurisdiction.

We had hounds down at the scene, the footprint trail was a bust. And there were no other tire tracks in the vicinity.

What are you getting at?

Maybe I should come along.

Fine.  The information doesn't leave this room.

So there was money there!  Who the hell's money is it?!

No, I can't say that I have.

All right youre the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?

Well they really didn't go into any details on the phone, but they did ask for you, and I figure we should try to help them out as best we can.

No.  Something wrong with you Dwayne?

Well, I just got a lot of things on my mind is all.

A surprise huh?  Well I don't like any surprises, especially if I'm forking over the loot for them!

Save me the sermon.  I've heard it all before, it's boring.

And if we refuse?  Your tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that?

Right behind you.

Well you're not getting, either.

Well it's not here -- you're wasting your time and you're pissing me off!

We gotta, Jesse.  It's tough, but you didn't leave us any choice.  We gotta know where the tapes are.

It was pretty gory ma, let me tell you.  But you have to turn all that off, and do your job, just like pop used to say.

And not just any air conditioner. This baby sells for over six hundred dollars retail.

Give me the bad news.

There was more than that.

So someone did get away.

No, I just assumed...

Last party all he wanted was Sting -- not one person danced.  Tonight I'm doing Superfreak, I don't care what he says.  Where is he?

What??  Where'd you hear that?

I'd like to see you try.

Is this about the funny money?

You've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning.  How come you always save me for last, James? When are you gonna learn.  Shit don't happen I don't know about.

One of my regulars lost fifty thousand dollars at the table here last week.  I was about to send my boys down to tune his ass up, when the guy comes in and pays off the whole thing.  Including the vig -- brand new sequential hundred dollar bills.  I knew something was wrong.  Cause this guy's got a regular job, no way he comes up with fifty grand in cash. But I tested the bills, infrared.  The whole thing.  And they checked out. 100%.

Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.

I don't think so...

No.  It's my first time.

I'm just in town for the weekend, taking in the sights.

You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.

Don't be messing with me, Lee.  I will kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.

Damn it, why are you ruining my night? I'm just starting to have fun.  Well fine then, go ahead, pull your badge and do your thing.

You mean Tito.  We had  Toto for dinner last night.

Carter...you ready to have some fun!?

She said I could pick any girl I want.

Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.

Really?  When's the last time you had some Mu-shu  Let's hear it, Lee, when was it?  Year of the rat?

And you ain't black!

Who died?

I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.

Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my ass!

No.  She's a school teacher.

Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man.

Because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!

The same place you find all RichWhiteMen.  Gefilte Fish.  Lox and bagel.  I love this stuff.  Here, try it with a smear.

Gimme the binoculars.

She just took her hair down.  Now she's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she's using both hands.  You better get that ice.

What?

There's people up here!

Take it!

It's a bomb.

We can help you.  I'm a detective in Hong Kong.

For how long?  Face it, Lee, she's playing both sides.

I thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues.  They don't let everybody in.

There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.

Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.

Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?

Forget it.  It doesn't matter.

It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak spot.  You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.

Who's Benjamin?

Don't you talk about my mama.  That's more like it.

Lee.  I just got an idea how someone could launder a hundred million dollars in cash.

Follow me my Asian brother.

Yes.  We have lots of big men chasing us.

No.  I'm going to find out.

I did!

It's worth it to me.

I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.

It's okay, I got lots more.

What "revenge" is he talking about?

Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.

Why don't you go get them?

I'm fine.

Now you know.

The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?

Any leads?

It's my responsibility.

I'll take him.

The police can protect you.

Do I look like I'm movin'?!  What you're seeing here?  This is not movement. This is my "still".

Hey, sir, it was a pleasure to preserve Johnson's ass.  Well...you know what I mean.

They asked for the best street man I had.

Don't push it. You better watch your ass with these Fed types. If there's a screw-up, they won't think twice about burnin' it.

Let me give you a piece of advice: never touch another man's radio. You do it again, nobody, not Rhonda, not Yolanda, gonna save your ass.

We are both full of shit.

Look, you want to work in this country, you gotta know this crap. Okay?  We're gonna be in some deep shit here.  Working the danger zone. And you need insurance.  Cause, you know, you might be starting some riots and shit.

No.

He was trying to kill me, not you.

What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb?

Don't go there...

Yeah, it's good.

No, no.  I'm full. Too much fin and hump, you know, gives me gas.  scuse me.

Who does not know War?  ³War, hhh, Wo-ooh-wo-ooh-wo-oh.  What is it good for?  Absolutely nothing. Good-God, you all.²

Going into the restaurant.

This concrete?  This is still America.

I am sorry, but I have too much respect for women.

Oh yes.

You drop my gun and you lose my i.d.?

What?

Hey, don't worry.  Nothing's gonna happen to it.

You know him?

Listen, this ain't about us! It's about a thirteen year old girl. She's not gonna make it. Unless we do something.

Alright, Johnson, thank you.  So...what are you wearing?

That's it! You can attack me, but when you attack my car, I cannot forgive! You in the back, girl!

Don't play bullshit games with me.

Do it!

Even if you deny the FBI is there, I will assume you are lying.

It's Griffin.

Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7.  As soon as they pick up the money, we've got em.

Ike just came by to check out the team.

Sure I do.  But the bet defense is a good offense, right?  You're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game.

Let him come to the wedding.  You're not running, right?  Say it. "I'm not..."

I lead Maggie through a visualization exercise.  All the sports shrinks use this head stuff.  Visualize the end zone, if you catch my drift.

Good one!  Thanks.

"Never say die."

I left four messages.  You don't return my calls.

That's not nothing to do with it.  You cooked this story up and you know it.

I merely write the stuff.  You're the one that serves it up.

I already made an appointment for later today.

I'm sorry, Ike.  This is permanent.

But one of those guys -- not one of them -- knew her at all.  Each one was convinced that she was perfect for them, but they didn't see her.  And she never showed up so they couldn't see her. It's a very symbolic thing happening. She becomes what she thinks they wanted to be.

Okay, you were right.  I hated my column, but I can do this assignment.

"Paid vindication"  That's what I call justice.

But I'll get my normal fee, right?

Then come for dinner.

Then you'll be my best man.

Splendid dissection of Maggie Carpenter, very professional job.

And you defending her?

Good fact.  Well, you let me know.

Tootaloo.

Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.

Oh, sure.  That was a long time ago. See, she's not a man-hater at all. She's very supportive of men...

Ah, beautiful.  I just can't see her leaving multiple grooms in the dust like that.

Gotta tell you this about my daughter. My daughter makes real good time, even in a long dress and heels.  Maggie may not be Hale's longest running joke, but she certainly is the fastest.

You have one?

But the most interesting thing here is that I don't see the rose tattoo that I've heard about on your back.

You can turn that finger around.

Seven-fifty.

He's an entomologist!  I thought it was very unique.

Highly suspect.

Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that?

Why don't you let him sleep it off in the trunk. I'll take you for a ride. Then we'll come back for him.  Keep an eye on him.

Yes.

You humiliated me!

I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me.

Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress.

It's something I've always wanted to do.

I wanted to talk to you about why I run or ride away from things.

I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?

Yes, I've seen it.  And I have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me!

No, I don't think you're like, "I'm charming and mysterious in a way that even I don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you".  Very hard to compete with.  Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery.

No.  You're quirky.  Quirky and weird are two different things.

I think you're right.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?

... I don't even want to talk about the luau.  What's this?

Not eight...

No sauntering down the aisle.  Just make time.  Let's just get there.

No, I'm just going to head home.

Wedding.  Wedding.  You just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row.

Quick.  Very quick.

Not this one.  This one's on me.

"And her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance.  So all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride isn't honeymooning with Las Vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race... before the rice hits the ground"  Holy moly.

It's not a boat boat.  It's really a house.

It's on the lake right in the middle of Seattle.  It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.

No, that's free.  He's an architect.  Used to do big high-profile projects.  He scaled it all back when his wife died.  Now he remodels people's homes.  He works in a small firm, makes a good living.

-- because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't --

-- who is the most competitive woman in the world --

They're going to love you.

My head swells up like a watermelon and I drop dead.

Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.

I love you.

Nope.

And then I'll see you in New York --

So what happened?

At the top of the Empire State Building --

Not really.  Look, Annie, I love you.  Let's leave that out of it.  I don't want to be someone you're settling for.  I don't want to be someone anyone settles for.  I have a life insurance policy, I'm fully invested in growth stocks, I have a paid subscription to Home Rox Office, I have no sexual diseases, I have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that isn't soft, I have expectation in the way of inherited wealth, I dress nicely, I am a member of the private sector, an independent voter, I don't watch Monday Night Football, the only thing wrong with me is that I am allergic to wheat, strawberries, penicillin, pollen, nuts and wool.  There are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring.  If you don't -- marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it, isn't it?

Yes.  Some people will do anything to get out of going to a symphony.

There's practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true --

You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.

That's impossible.  A guy can't --

Listen to this, I love this part --

Becky?

You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?

Well, it's the same woman.  And he was crazy about her.  What is this?  This is from Seattle.

M.F.E.O.?

A sense of humor.

This is a grotesque violation of this man's personal life, but never mind --

Howard.

Any time.

I know.  He's wonderful, isn't he?

How amazing.

Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --

And if I could describe it, it probably wouldn't be on a radio show.  But what the hell.  It's not one specific thing.  It's more of a feeling. 

I've been pretty sad, but I think my dad is worse.

Why not?

Well, okay.  What's the big deal?  If she'll forget the new fireplace, I'll marry her. Just point me in the right direction.

I don't think it could let a woman pay for dinner.

What's tira misu?

What is it?

I'm not going to think about what they're not teaching you in school.  I am not going to think about it.  Generally speaking I think we should rule out people who don't live somewhere near here --

What?

You're worried we're going to be all right.  We're going to be all right.  I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby.  Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.

I know.  But she's here, Jonah. Because I have you.  And as long as I have you, I have your Mom.

The heels on these shoes are very large.  Why have I never noticed this? The heels on these shoes are grotesque.

Now I'm late.  Bye.

Oh, right.

She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore.  She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day.  On top of the Empire State Building.

The water tastes better in the kitchen.

It's a short word.

I sincerely hope you are not going to marry Jessica.

This is the one I like.

No.

What about it?

I went camping once.  I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.

I tried to talk to her...  It was like I knew her.  Weird.

So whatdya say? I'll get the check, and I'll call you in eight months.

You want 'em all arrested?

It's the paymaster from Moscow -- with our gold.

So? What does he want to do about 'em?

He will if he wants us to go on blasting.

No, Estellita.

No. No. I can't. If Ramón ever found me on a picket line ...

Forget it? I chop wood for the stove five times a day. Every time I remember. I remember that across the tracks the Anglo miners have hot water in pipes. And bathrooms. Inside.

If I think of myself it's because you never think of me. Never. Never. Never...

Never... never... never!

I'd lie on my cot in the cell and I couldn't sleep with the bugs and the stink and the heat. And I'd say to myself, think of something nice. Something beautiful. And then I'd think of you. And my heart would pound against the cot for love of you.

There's Jenkins' wife. You don't see her on no picket line.

Can be what?

We can't go on this way. I just can't go on living with you. Not this way.

Sun up.

Aah! They've got other mines. You don't see the larger picture.  They've got millions. Millions. They can outlast us, and they know it.

Shut up, you're talking crazy.

Look who's talking! The Great White Father, and World's Champion of Women's Rights.

Me, I'm a camp follower -- following this organizer from one mining camp to another -- Montana, Colorado, Idaho. But did he ever think to organize the women? No. Wives don't count in the Anglo locals either.

Exactly. And equality's the one thing the bosses can't afford. The biggest club they have over the Anglo locals is, "Well -- at least you get more than the Mexicans."

Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?

You mean Delaware?

I thought maybe you forgot...

Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?

You Judas ... blood-sucker ...

Yeah.

Um, coupla' eight balls oughta do us.

You like that?

First rate, ain't it?

Ouch.

Nothing.

Look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy?

Don't tell me, down deep he's really not a bad person and you don't want to see him get hurt.

Why not?

How?

Trust me. We're safe.

Never heard of him.

Please open the door, Danny.

What about a battered woman's shelter? You can move you kid in with you.

I want to do this for you.  I want to do something good for a change.

Danny, it's not what you think.

You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding.

I know it's not my place to pass judgement on you but ...

Guess it's our turn.

I know a guy.

I'm serious, dude.  You always seem to be on top of things, even when you're tweakin'.

Palmdale

I think on account of his nose.

No. I'm good.

John Fitzgerald Kennedy.

You aren't coming with me.

Hey, check it out...

I can't tell you.

I don't trust anybody.

Because I don't want to see you end up like Kujo and those other losers.  I thought that maybe if you knew that I didn't use, you might see it in yourself to go clear.

Crank or glass?

Hey, okay.

But you're a friend of Jimmy's. I think of you as a brother already.

Big Bill.

Please .. I don't know what you're ...

Yeah.

Just some buddies.

You go, boy.

Well, you know what they say, just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean everyone's not out to slice your balls off and shove 'em down your throat.

The money? The drugs? Keeping yourself out of jail? I know the drill.

After that ass-whipping you gave me?

What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?

Jesus.

Yeah.  What about him?

Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy.

Oh they're all that and the proverbial bag of chips.

Several possession charges, but nothing major.

You mean the menacing red car?

It's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch.

Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to?  And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?

That is so unfair.

A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery, we took twenty-three prisoners, turned them over to intelligence.

You writin' a book or somethin'?

Figured.

Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft.  Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister.

I guess.

Like hell, you did.

You didn't volunteer, Jackson.

Yes, sir.  It seems to me, sir, that the entire resources of the United States Army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle of Berlin, Germany.  Now I ain't one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that saving one private, no matter how grievous the losses of his family, is a waste of my God-given talent.

Say what, Cap'n?

That's not all.  There were nine gunners on the eighty-eights, one had a broken heel on his boot, two had bratwurst for supper last night, one of them is named Fritz, the other, Hans, maybe, I don't know, it's hard to tell.

Like I said, it was nothing.  Don't bunch up.

Pass.

Yes.  Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy?

I'll tell you what, if I'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, I'll let you know and we'll split the money.

I don't expect to live that long.

Did he see any sign of them?

You don't count.

Those guns are close.

Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades.

But, sir...

I changed my mind.

I wish.  You and I are taking a squad up to Ramelle on a public relations mission.

I'll do my best.

Yes, sir.

Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.

We're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else.

Out of the mouth of babes.

Oh, Captain, they'll always make lingerie, it's one of the three basic needs of man -- food, shelter, silk teddies.  Miller Dream on, private.

No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or what about Faulkner?  Or that little guy with the glasses?

Yeah, how so?

There's to be a bright side, look for it.

You have orders, too.

I'm sorry, sir, I apologize.  But if you weren't a captain, or if I were a major, what would you say?

That's a mystery to me.

ON THE BRIDGE!  WE'RE COMING IN.

Have it your way, Captain.

See to it.

HERE THEY COME!

Yeah, yeah.  I want you right next to me, no matter where I go, you understand?

Alright, come with me.

I won't need to sir, it's already here, behind the barricade so...

Looks at Miller, sees him growing weak, starting to sway.  He gently tries to move Miller aside.

And Sarge?

That's because, as I have pointed out on numerous occasions, you are a happy idiot.

I care.  Don't you know what Caen's famous for, Sarge?

We know.

He's fast, Captain, I saw him.

For going to school?

How do you know how to draw the red line anyway?

Look, I'm really sorry that Mom and Dad made you take me in. Really.  If it's such a big deal, I'll go.  But remember this, it used to be fun.  It used to be warped, twisted and hilarious, and I mean that in the best possible way, I mean it as a compliment. I mean, I'm sorry T-I-M left you.  But I am not T-I-M.

I just washed this shirt, didn't I?

What's a scam?

I'm gonna call her.

C'mon Lloyd.

That's just so embarrassing.

You've got to do something special.  You've got to make a statement.

I am.

If she wants me, she can come to me.

He wants to leave things on a good note.

Meaning?

He'd like to start serving immediately.

Alright.

I'm going to take out Diane Court again.

Okay.

Okay, I promise I will.  Just come here a minute, I want to show you something.

Now this is the only thing your mother ever gave me that I kept. Now it's yours.  Go ahead, open it.

Goodnight.

I knew how planes flew, but I was still a little nervous.

Dad, I'm so sorry.  I know this is a bad time.

I like him a lot.

'I like him'?  Diane, I'm talking about being honest with people, being decent...

No, I will.  I don't want to leave something out because I know I can say anything to you.  You're a liar, and a thief.

I'm so ashamed dad.

Diane, I do have a history with this man, and it's not the greatest.  I see you so seldom, I'd really rather know about you.

If we could just talk about boys everything would be so much easier.  You know, your room is always ready for you, you can always come home if... alright, what do you want me to do?

Hi.  You called me?

Well, not monumentally.

Pardon me?

Eight.

Yeah.

Bye.

That's cool then.

Twisted?

Basic.  Hmmm.

Sixteen weeks is a long time.

Yeah, I've had it forever.  I used to have this thing with marking the words that I looked up.

Yeah?

I had a checklist in mind.  I thought that if babies were on the plane, the plane couldn't crash.  But all the babies were crying, and I thought they knew something I didn't.

I usually have a break after the dinner service, if you want to stop by.

Come on.

I'll see you there.  Bye.

Friends with potential.

Yeah?

Oh.  I was putting the...

No I didn't.

No.

Why, did you tell Corey what happened?

No, that's fine.  She'll tell everybody, but that's fine.

Alright, personalised flight care from Corey.  Books, cassettes, magazines, anything?

Your only mistake is that you didn't dump her first.  Diane Court is a showpony.  You need a stallion, my friend.  Walk with us and you walk tall.

Man, you never had a chance with a girl like that.

Man, you're bringing me down!

You've gotta get her out of your head, man.

He's back.  Hey my brother, can I borrow a copy of your 'Hey Soul Classics'?

Work that jab, work that hook, work that jab, okay, take a break, take a break.

Hello.  May I please speak with Diane please?

Uh... okay... um...

Okay. She's really pretty great, isn't she?

Fine Lloyd.

How do you pay for one of those?

I'm totally and completely serious.

Go ahead, pick it up if you want.

She's very successful.

I know this part, keep reading.

Dude, why do you think I keep her tapes?  They're going to be valuable some day.

Your car?

My dad's a lieutenant colonel in the army, he wants me to join, he wants to pull some strings.  I mean, there's no possible way.

You know Diane Court?

Alright, I love you too. Go to sleep.

Things worked out.  I made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. It was good.

Itzhak Stern?  He's on the list.

He's on the list.  If he were an essential worker, he would not be on the list. He's on the list.  You can't have him.

Oskar, please -

War.

In Breslau.

Well, you've been through it.  You know. You could make things easier for me.

I just told you.

You don't recognize it?  Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.

That's great.

That's great, thanks.

There's nothing in the stores.

Nice things cost money.

I don't know, ten or twelve.  That's a good color.  Dark blues, grays.

How should I know?  It's broken. See what you can do.

Things are great, things are great.

I need a drink.

We're losing the war, aren't we.

Did I threaten anybody here?  I stated a simple fact.

Something they can hold in their hands.

There's a machinist outside who'd like to thank you personally for giving him a job.

Oskar -

And killing.

There's nothing you can do.  I'm not asking you to do anything.  You came into my office.

No?

You don't?  I do.  I see a difference.

I lost a day of production.  I lost a worker.  I expect to be compensated.

Of course he's stealing from me, we're in business together.  What is this?  I'm sitting here, suddenly everybody's talking like this is something bad.  We take from each other, we take from the Army, everybody uses everybody, it works out, everybody's happy.

That doesn't work, sir.

Find me every variation of Himbry and what was the other name...

They've broken their pattern.

On national television.

It's hell week. Chill. The movie murders have brought out the crazies. It's nothing.

Why aren't you there?

That's too bad.

Don't forget to set the alarm.

I'll go. I don't mind. Really.

You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.

I wish it was just a year. I lost everything because of you. I have nothing now. Look at me, this is what I've become. A long silence. Sidney is hanging on by threads.

Its over, Cotton.

Enter Cotton Weary.

"And I hope life treats you kind and I hope you have all you dreamed of offffff. I wish you JOYYY."

She dumped me.

Sid, you don't have to.

It's not you, Derek. I don't trust myself. I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men.

Good question. You took the bait.

But nobody wants to see that. Itll never go. Theyll rewrite you. You dont want that.

What guy?

Yeah, how can we help? Do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life?

Or it found us.

Miss Weathers.

Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.

I know that.

Can we turn the light on?

..and as lonely as I am...

No, wait here.

Whatever.

Stay away from the cop.

No, Gale, I'm just getting started. Seeya soon.

Yeah, well...you are the definition of mixed emotions. I really should hate you... I see your movie's getting good reviews.

My morn was a Delta.

But who would operate your camera?

Sig Ep's gotta band, tonight.

What?

Please, I have the perfect excuse.

No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.

You fucking freaked out movie nut psychos..

The crowd is really with the movie. Some even talk to the screen. "You dumb bitch. Get out of the house." etc.

I counted four.

Easy black boy.

This has nothing to do with me, Joel. There's an estimated 270 serial killers currently active in the US at any given time. I can't control that. Who's hungry?

Thanks, Joel.

..harmonica style is okay.

Gee, let me think. "Do you want to..." Is that the best you can do? Some tired hand me down rehash? Hey, pal, no one's gonna write a book about you. No movie rights. Nothing. I've been through this before and much better I might add.

Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here.

Where you going?

Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world. I bet you did such a great job.

Hello.

Who is this?

Well ya got me. That's me. I'm Ben Damon.

Closer than you think.

To see your reaction.

Well if you won't work for me, will you work for the president?

I'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D.  Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon, or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS?

Both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.

I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but there's more. The killer left a note.

I go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers.

Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?

Call me Mark, would you?  Cause I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.

I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not,  watching it alone.

Catch him, or kill him.

Yeah. A real tragedy.

What does this have to do with Sid?

He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?

And what made you think it was Sidney?

I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up here with the people I care about.  Now where's this Kincaid guy the news is talking about? I found this place from a FOX 5 TV NEWS REPORT. Heh.

Do you want me to come with you Sid? I mean, remember what Randy said?

Yes. Look, let's get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.

Again, I am the author of the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.!  What about you?

And who is that?

Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?

What?

What's your favorite scary movie Gale?

What the hell are you doing?

Need to get in that building?

Settle down Beavis.  Why don't you tell us the truth?

Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends.

Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you did play me for three movies.  His two hands, dingus.

GALE WEATHERS?! What are you doing here? No press on the set!  No press, no press on set! Get that woman out of here.

Yeah.

Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go. It's dead and buried. Daddy took ol' Yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago.

Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya. Stage the news to boost ratings.

What?  What movie?

And still the film is Number One at the box office this weekend. Beat out American Pasty and Arlington Street.

SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT. "What are you talking about Ricky, the murders were a completely isolated incident".

I'm just saying, though. What if there's someone out there stalking actors? Huh? Then what?

No one's saying you did.

I was just asking. Why are you always at me?

Oh...

Odds are -- she'll miss anyway.

No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone, Sheriff.

I'll only stay a sec.

What are you doing here?

So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump.

I heard screaming. The door was locked. Are you okay...

Hey, hey, it's just me.

Ssshh... everything's gonna be okay. I promise.

Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed Mama's boy.

To apologize.

Wait, wait, don't hang up.

I only eat popcorn at the movies.

Guess.

So, you gotta boyfriend?

His name wouldn't be Steve, would it?

Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.

Come on. It's you favorite scary movie, remember? He had a white mask, he stalked the baby-sitters.

Lucky, for you there's a bonus round. But poor Steve... I'm afraid... he's out.

Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.

Twenty-five, huh? In a demographic study I proved to be most popular amongst males, 11-24. I just missed you. Of course, you don't look a day over twelve, except in the upper torso area. Does the force require that you work out?

Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.

Then what are you doing here?

What kind of lead?

He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?

Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up.

Yeah.

Afraid not.

Not yet.

How is everything?

We haven't located her Dad yet.

Yes, sir.

Not my daughter... not my...

But it's so much easier when we make it up.

Prep the compact, we'll hide it in a window and tape all of tonight's festivities.

Kenny. Camera. Now.

Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it.

Have you talked to Cotton?

Has his story changed?

Scary night, isn't it? With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something.

That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.

So who are you?

Uh-huh.

If you hang up, you'll die just like your mother.

Who are you?

Working, thank you.

She's the Scream Queen.

Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know.  Now that's poor taste.

There's always some stupid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend. That's the beauty of it all. Simplicity. Besides, if it's too complicated you lose your target audience.

Could be. Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me?

So while they're off investigating a dead end, Billy, who's been written off as a suspect, is busy planning his next hunting expedition.

I had 'em hid in the foreign section.

Are you serious?

Whatever. Just hurry.

It's alright. I'll get it.

Just a sec... I need to talk to someone.

Don't go there, Sid. You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick. Don't freak yourself out -- we've got a long night ahead of us.

You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.

With Stu, there's little time to stop and reflect. But sometimes before, to relax and get in the mood, I think about Grant Goodeve.

During foreplay, I sing the theme song to myself. "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." It's a real turn on.

Hey, go easy, Tatum. He didn't do it.

Tits -- see.

Give it to me.

What about the trace on his bank account and the guns?  There must be something to connect him with a past.

He wouldn't just turn himself in.  It doesn't make any sense.

Announcing what?

So what?  This victim...

Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins.  But, this was a fat guy.  The killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the time.  It's like the fashionable thing to do.

Why?

David... please...

Murderers?

Shut up!

I wasn't standing around guarding the local Taco Bell.  I've worked homicide for five and a half years.

I realize that.

I made a decision, because I have to consider the integrity of the scene.  I can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.

You always have to find one singular thing to focus on.  There's always one thing, and it may be as small as a speck of dust, but you find it and focus... till it's an exhausted possibility.

But, why would there be so many pieces in his stomach if it were nothing?  It must have been intentional.

I'm invited to have a late supper at your house.  And, I accept.

Hello.

I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.

Yeah.  Parts of them.  Anyway, in Purgatory, Dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain... seeing all these other guys who sinned...

Right.  But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.  The sins are in a different order.

A switchblade.

It doesn't fit.  He doesn't want us to help him stop.

Oh, that's all.

Satisfy our curiosity?

Never took a bullet.  I pulled my gun once. fired it once.

I got him.  I got the son-of-a-bitch. See, I was doing really good up till then. Lots of street busts.  I've always had this weird luck... everything always went my way, but this was wild.  I got him with one shot... right between the eyes.  Next thing I know, the mayor's pinning a medal on me.  Picture in the paper, whole nine yards.

Call an ambulance.

This is the job.  It's not an Easter egg hunt.

No.  He's not depending on luck.  You've seen that.  We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied Victor to the bed, to the day.  To the day! Because he wanted us to.

Yes we do.  Here...

And so what?

Yeah, well... at least we're out of the office.  We've got pizza.

Saint Thomas Aquinas.  He wrote about the seven deadly sins.

I'm fine.

We had him.

If we get him, I'll be happy enough.

How can you say that?  Especially after today?

You're the oldest man I know, Somerset.

It wasn't one thing, if that's what you mean.  I just... I can't live here anymore. I can't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue.

Wrong!  I sympathize completely, because if you can't win... then, if you don't ignore everything and everyone around you, you... you become like John Doe.  It's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it, because it takes so much work to love.  You just have to make sure you don't stop to think about the abuse, and the damage, because you'll risk being sad.  Keep ignoring.

I can't let you do this...

Oh... um, William.

High school and college, yes.  Pretty hokey, huh?  I knew on our first date this was the man I was going to marry.  God... he was the funniest man I'd ever met.

I want to have children.  It's just...

This is a done deal.  All but the paperwork.

How should I know?

Stealing the cattle was just to pull us out...This here's a murder raid...  It shapes up to scald out either your place...or my brother's.

It was, I tell you!

What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...

This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.

Dunno...Seems so.

Yes sir...

Amen!...Put an 'amen' to it!

How far's the river from here, Mose?

There sure is! I'm going to tell you somethin'...I wasn't going to speak of it...But I'll tell you now. Did you notice them scalps strung on Scar's lance?  Did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance? Long... wavy hair...

Now mount up, son...

Go ahead, son...But at the first alarm, we're comin' in -- and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do...

Sir?

God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...

All right...But keep your eye on me, boy...I'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages...If you don't hear me first time I holler, you better read my mind...I don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand...

Oh...Now what's this your pa wants to know?

JOINT action?

But...but captain, we can't possibly take the field tomorrow...for your own protection...

You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward.

Me neither...But this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the Nawyecky Comanches.

In that case you won't find her -- and I won't get my thousand dollars.

Stop callin' me 'uncle'...I ain't your uncle.

Good night...

I ain't stayin'...I set out lookin' for Debbie...I aim to keep on...

Maybe I'm gettin' like Mose Harper -- my bones is cold tonight...

He just couldn't wait...

What?

She ain't goin' back to her family, that's certain...not if she took off where the arrow points.

Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, too....

You breeds are all alike -- two drinks an'...

We won't be here...Come on!

Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...

Not far from it...

That's the breed...Course it might take time.

You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?

No...not yet...

From the beginning...

Ain't worth the mendin'...

Finish your breakfast...

You do and I'll die, Martie...I will! I'll just die!

You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...

Sorry...  Keep the column moving!..Close ranks there!

Come on, say it.  You know...

They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones?

Not a book fair.  I was signing autographs in a department store.

So do I, believe me.

Someone from the village.

You know, it's not always easy for me, either.  But at least I try not to give in to each and every neurosis.

I went to see Prof. Roth!  You know, I had another one of those dreams last night.  I saw Tommi!

Ellen, what are you trying to prove, anyway?  That we've created ourselves a ghost?  Come on!

It's simply too dangerous here! But no, you always have to have it your way.

What are you talking about-

I wouldn't have made it by myself.

You're doing fine, aren't you?  I mean... the two of you alone in that house, so far out in the moor.

Excuse us.  But do stop by for a visit sometime!  You are welcome anytime.

We should leave the past alone.

How could I fail to notice that! - I have to go...

Not so bad, if I could get some peace and quiet around here.

And the title of this piece?

Romeo?--he gave it to Henslowe.

Ask him.

Ten pounds.

It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.

That's me.

A share of the profits.

Very well.

it will be all right, madam.

As soon as I have found my muse

Tomorrow

What? Who?

I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.

The daughter of his enemy.

I thought your play was for Burbage.

A different one you haven't written?

Lady Viola is pious, my lord.

Thank you. Let go, there's a good nurse.

All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all.

From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?

Your Majesty.

Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost his wife in the play- house--go make your farewell and send her out. It's time to settle accounts.  How much was the wager?

I have lost my gift.

Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE?

Luck be with you, Sam.  Sam?

I was in a play. They cut my head off in Titus Andronicus. When I write plays, they will be like Titus.

I have to get back.

Who is there?

Oh--I am him too!

Oh, not for the world!

Can you love a player?

Well perhaps better than my first. 

What will you have me do? Marry you instead?

You lie.

But I will go to Wessex as a widow from these vows, as solemn as they are unsanctified.

"Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."

Sold in marriage and half way to America.

My lord.

I will do my duty, my lord.

Ah! My lady! The tide waits for no man, but I swear it would wait for you!

Of course you have not! I have not written it!

If you love her, you must do what she asks.

It is only ours you can know.

Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early morning rose would wither on the branch, if it could feel envy!

Constantly. Without doubt. And plays the lute, she has a natural ear. And her bosom--did I mention her bosom?

Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round and rare as golden apples!

What?

I don't have time to discuss it now. I don't care so long as he's not a freak.

It's true. A newspaper is paying for all this. A newspaper...

Juliet?

I'm only asking you both to think about it.

A spade, we need a spade -- I wish you would concentrate -- we need a spade if we're going to dig a pit.

We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?

Just stop worrying.

Anyway, what I was wanting to say was this --

I don't know.

No, it doesn't. I tried to let it worry me but it won't. I've worked on that paper for three years. There is a pensioner's terror ordeal on page six every day. Every day. Maybe when I'm a pensioner it'll worry me.

You're not eating.

Secure it? What do you mean -- you're gong to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank Or what, you want to bury it? Is that it?

Looking for you? Yes.

Your friends.

They know? So what? They have nothing, there is nothing, to connect us to that bodies stuff.

So I gathered.

Take another look at these two.

Oh, no problems. Don't worry.

Yes.

Now, let me get this straight. This affair that you're not having, is it not with a man or not with a woman?

Yeah, he had one too many of thise urges. You of all people should know that.

No, Alex, we don't really love you.

David?

Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.

Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.

Yes.

Why not? What's wrong, Juliet? Aren't you curious? Don't you wonder what he died from?

I want my money back. Excuse me.

That's not him.

You were magnificent.

Then let's spend some money.

Be like a weight off your shoulders.

What are you doing here?

And the money?

Where he can't get it?

You're frightened.

Everything.

Alex.

We were just sorting things out.

The perfect couple, I should say.

No.

What?

Of course.

And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?

Yes, absolutely.

You're sure of that.

Did you ever kill a man?

Keep it going, Alex. You're unstoppable now.

Two hundred pounds?

What?

No one. I promise.

No one.

I should hope so.

You and me?

And you need your sleep.

That's right. You're going to Rio. Rio de Janeiro. On your own. Come on, you should know. You bought the fucking ticket.

Sorry?

Oh, I see, I thought you meant --

Would you like to see the rest?

Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it.

And that's not the same thing?

The first one was fine.

Excellent. DC Mitchell is a rising star, Mr. Stevens. Under my tutelage he will undoubtedly make the grade.

Is it real?

I am... except I've gotta do somebody at their house.

She's a very groovy girl. That's the problem.

Maybe... why do you ask?

Why?

Yes, but... I thought...

Yes, sweetheart, shh.

That's okay too.

-- yes, we're all trying to do something to make this a better country to live in, believe it or not.

I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.

Listen, baby, don't leave, really.

I'll be right back, it's just that this girl is a different girl... she has attacks.

I don't want to see you anymore.

What?

Whatever you say.

I wouldn't say so if I didn't.

No, that's okay, I'll do It now.

Holy Christ. You want to get us killed?

Nobody can hear it.

I don't know, kill herself. She's O.D.'d four times.

Hello.

Hungry?

No thanks.

Am I what?

You don't have to make conversation with me, I'm not my mother... do you have a thing about older women... that's sort of faggoty isn't it?

You live a phony cheap cop-out existence.

Yeah.

Great.

Right, that's right.

Well, yeah... you know.

Look, Mr. Roundy, why don't you make out a financial statement? It'll save us both some time. Miss Michaels here can show you... have it notarized and we'll see where we go from there. Miss Michaels, would you get me a couple of forms?

Look, Norman, I'm not the shampoo girl.

-- Yeah... your car down here?

You going to tell him?

Probably the bathroom.

I'd cut it...

Great.

Yeah... I mean great.

It's hot in here.

Do you? You still see him?

And what?

What?

Did I what?

You did, didn't you?

You did, I know you did.

I know... you don't know, I know.

What are you talking about?

Shut the door, Lester. What do you think this is, a picnic?

-- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy?

-- this guy with Jill.

Sweetheart, you're drunk.

Jackie, can we --

The lawn -- it looks like it goes on forever, doesn't it?

-- look, you don't have to entertain me...

Nothing.

Look who's talking.

-- do you want ice?

-- we are?

Why?

I want to marry you. I want to take care of you and I want your children, and I want you to be my girl. That's all I want. That's all I want out of my life, and it's a lot.

It's too late...

Don't go, Jackie...

What?

Wanda...

You were supposed to handle that bitch, she's always asking for you, and she was furious you weren't here.

She's murdered her hair... you do something with her, I'm never going to touch her again.

If I have to touch her again, I'll throw up!

Wash her.

-- Oh yeah.

-- oh -- sweetheart...

-- please, please forgive me...

That's too bad.

Hey, stop by the shop.

I don't have your number, stop by the shop.

What're you talking about?

Nobody's gonna get you but me!

Yeah, baby.

Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.

Okay.

I want your feelings about it.

I'll call you.

Nothing, I'll call you, okay?

What do you mean, what is it? It's some political bullshit.

Wait a minute, God-damn-it. Do you think I want to go to some God damned party? I'm trying to get that God damned shop open. I'm trying to get a little bread together. That's all I'm doing.

Commercials.

-- what?  -- I'll see you later...

I don't want to fight either. Look... uh -- I love you.

What is.

Well, did you get a job out of it at least?

I don't want to be a fool!... I want to look them in the eye and say, I know!

Did you?

Well, yeah.

I see.

In a way. But...

Oh yeah? I mean I know.

... this doing hair it's...

I'm not anti-Establishment.

Then don't... just have 'em beat me up or whatever you're gonna do.

... how am I gonna tell you what they have against you? I mean Jesus fucking Christ, they're women, aren't they? Have you ever listened to women talk, man? Have you? Well I do, I do 'til it's fucking coming out of my ears. I'm on my feet all day, every fucking day, listening to women talk and you know what they talk about, don't you? Being fucked up by some guy. That's all that's on their minds. I'm sure you've done something they could get pissed off about, what's that got to do with it? All women are pissed off, man, all of 'em. They fucking hate us! Don't you know that?

We're always trying to fuck them... they know it and they like it and they don't like it... that's just how it is... look, it's got nothing to do with you, man. It just happened. Felicia's got nothing to do but shop and get her hair done and she knows she's getting older... her daughter hates her, what's she going to do, go to PTA meetings?

Oh, are you kidding, man? She hates her.

I don't either, Lester, I swear to you I don't.

Lester, it just happened.

No.

Okay, okay...

Yeah.

Okay.

A soap?

I am?

Then you were talking to him.

Really? How about starting with tonight?

Oh, I'm sorry.

Just a second, I've gotta clean this mess up or the dogs'll have it all over the house.

Aren't you going to have one?

Why not?

Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I've told you about Jill a hundred times, Lester, you never remember anything I say.

Jackie, what're you doing?

I'll call you.

I know, I'm sorry.

-- No. No really.

I don't know. One minute he's up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything's going to be great and he's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he won't even talk to me. It's driving me crazy.

Jackie --

What did you do?

Now I'm embarrassed to tell you.

All right, forget this filth. Continue about your friend.

Is he an enemy?

I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you.

Getting your hair done...  Would you like to go to a party?

Well... sure...

Let's do that.

-- these bastards have me hemmed in.

No.

Yes?

Do you feel bad?

I guess so.

What?

How does he tell you things?

Do they know he tell you things?

Try to think what it was.

Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?

Okay, Mom.

All right.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Not right now, Daddy's asleep.

Come on, Doc.  He only went to bed a few hours ago.  Can't you wait till later?

Yes.

No.  It's the little boy that lives in my mouth.

Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?

Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some?

He is, Mr. Torrance.

A nigger.

Will you indeed, Mr. Torrance.

Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you.

There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.

Thank you very much.  I'll do that.

Sure.

I'm a Wendy.

I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.

Pleased to meet you.

What line of work are you in now?

Thank you for saying so.

What time is it?

Good.

How do you like it?

When do you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?

Jack...

Of course you are.

Why?

I'm not going to hurt you.

Wendy give me the bat.

Give me the bat.

Go away from me.

Oh, well - come on in Jack.

Oh, no problem at all.  I made the trip in three and a half hours.

Well...

put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.

No problem.  In fact we had time to grab a bite to eat.

Oh...

Well, it's very... homely.

Royalty?

Just like a ghost ship, huh?

Fine.

Uncle Al-

Let me help you up.

Where's Mom?

What's that?

What?

Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.

Let the boy finish the game, Nan.

What if it's some kind of monster?

I'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that.

She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.

What?

Yeah, I know. It's great!

I called Peltzer on my way over here, Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution. That's a fancy way of saying eyewash. He's got a corneal inflammation.

I don't know. But I know you didn't see any werewolf the other night, Marty. You had a dream, that's all. An extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what's been happening in this town.

Marty, the moon wasn't even full!

Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.

BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH

I think they hear you!

Yes, Mary?

We were talking about the wild thing. Teen promiscuity.

Hey, I know, it's hard.  But do what I do.

What?

Today was the deadline, Vince.

And to say you're sorry.  About this afternoon.  And the things you said. Forgotten.  Completely.  Do you understand?  Forgotten.

Good evening, Vincent.

Oh-huh.

Yes, Betty?

Right.

Not in years.

Why?

Sure is!  Come on in, and sing a spell.

Chops?

The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a girl.  Of course.  SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE

This is so exhilarating!  All week long, I can't wait till Sunday, when we sing.

It's true -- I know her.

You know that song?

I hear you.  How many days a week do you rehearse?

Again!

You re okay -- for a civilian.

I... I brought you something.

Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you?  Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents?  We can call the Enquirer.

Excuse me?

What?

Are you sure?

It's part of St. Katherine's new community outreach program.  How old are you?  You shouldn't be smoking.  Have you ever seen a diseased lung?  Hand 'em over.

Keep moving!

A thank-you?  For what?  You're the one we should be thanking.

What?

You mean black people?

Before we do, you might like to freshen up.  And you'll certainly want to change

No problem.

I'm outta here.

Silence?  No talking?  All day?

Useless distractions.

Those girls were asking questions. They've got it rough.  I wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age.  I wish somebody would talk to me about it now.

You are correct.  Sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation.  Such as your own, for example.  How do you feel about physical labor?

I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.

I know!  I'm sorry   I didn't mean for it to happen!  And I was the one they were shooting at!

I am?

Out of the question.

What do you mean?

I must go where I can be of use.

Okay, so I just got things started.  But you could build on that.  You could keep it going.

But...

Don't push it.

Safest place in the world.  You think Vince would look for you here?

Go in and talk to her.  It can't hurt.  Go.

Listen to yourself.  This isn't a career opportunity.

Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..

Me too.

I think they'd understand.

Even nuns have to pee.

Maybe. 

So, take it off.

Which one!

Yeah, right -- when I see it.

She's praying.

We're losing it.

Reverend Mother, on behalf of the sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary Clarence to St. Katherine's.

Yes?

All right.  It's a beginning.  Las Vegas, Nevada.

It's brought people back to the church.

It's no use.  She just isn't here.

Yes?

And therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.

And you'll face that danger head-on.  As if I could stop you.  And you have my complete support in this matter. Anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing.

She did.  Bring her back.  Now.  For a talk.

She's acting weird, Vince.  Ever since we picked her up.

Sarah has gone missing... my servant girl.  Her things are gone.  Damn it. She has joined the migration out of town.  What about breakfast, woman?  Or, am I to starve to death?

You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?

To place it inside its coffin.

What of it?

Damn you, sir!  God damn you to hell!

I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.

Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?

Van Ripper and his wife agreed to take him.  They have children and a good home and good land.

And now Jonathan Masbath.

No, you listen!  You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...

I deserve to help you.  Don't you see how much this means?  My father... he... he was a good man...

I have others.  All I need is this.

Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to business.

Listen.

What happened?

You grow sharper by the minute, little man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others.

True enough.

Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply.

We should go.

Because, I serve a fine purpose alive. It is perfection for our murderer if I return to New York City with nothing more than tales of a galloping ghoul.  We must uncover the reason these victims were targeted.  What was taken from them... other than their lives? Who benefits by their deaths?

Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it.  Did you find the victims' loan agreements?

Take the reins.

Tired.

Are you so superstitious?

I, um... I have something to show you, if you have a moment.

You made this, and the drawings?

You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes.

There was no blind stabbing.  This singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother.

What?

If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?

I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.

And, what did he say?

What did he say, Katrina?

Speak the words, Constable.  What is stopping you?  What has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality?

I do not know.  Away.

He moves too fast.

No.  She has gone out.

To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall?

I didn't see none.

What did you say?

Doctor, he is awake.

I can't remember.

I'll let you off while it's still daylight.

See there. Thinks of the simplest thing first.

Scooter, let's me and you go over to Dairy Queen and pick up a few things for lunchtime.

No, don't guess I do.  Scooter, good to meet you.  This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I'll understand if you get nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.

He won't have anything to do with him. Now you say it's all right for him to stay out here in the back?

Good to know you, Karl.

How are you, Bill?

Just thought I'd check on Karl and see if everything's working out.

What do you like to eat here?

French-fried potaters.

Give me the big'uns.

Karl, you better clap your hands or he'll just keep on.

What are you doin' with that damn hammer?

It went real good.

He's real honest. He wouldn't steal nothin'.

No sir.

Come on, don't be a pussy. Everybody has to work.

That's funny.  You go to bed and take snot nose with you.

I thought I told you to keep out!

Why? Hi, Karl.

Yeah.

He never did want to. I figure he ain't changed his mind much.

You don't need to know all of that. You're just a boy. You need to think about good thoughts while you're still a boy. They'll be plenty of time for the other.

Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me that.

That gal that made employee of the month give 'em to me for awalkin' with her.

That's than un on Christmas I was tellin' you about.

Them boys was tryin' to pull me down pretty hard.

I knowed you'd be here.  What are you a-doin' digging with that stob?

You know I would. Whatever you want.

Frank told me about your situation. And Frank loves company. You know, especially after his daddy passed and all. There ain't no sense in you stayin' in that old greasy shop.  He's mentally retarded, poor thing.

They ain't even no good. The only one can play is Randy Horsefeathers. He claims he's an Indian. His real name's Randy Collins and he works at the feed mill. He can at least play guitar.

I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.

I bet he don't. Karl likes me.

We've had a real hard life, too, Mama.

I ain't really thought about it too much I don't reckon.

I ain't got no boy.

I want to come back and stay here.

Naw. Never did know too much of nobody. Not to he'p me out anyway.

I told 'em about it. They know I'm well. That Mizz Wheatley made me some biscuits.

I didn't aim to.

No ma'am.

Right now?

Well, set down and I'll make some biscuits and gravy.

Vaughan's "friend" will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He says you make him feel calm.

I could shore use some. Thank ye.

Ma'am?

What's that you say?

So, you're really going to stay here?

How long have you been standing here?

Listen, before you get very used to staying here, I think you and I need to talk about a few things. Can I take you to lunch?

I've heard it said that way.

Yes sir.

Melvin, go get Karl and take him down to the old classroom.

Before they were married?

We've got some paperwork to take care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry, you won't run into him in the parking lot.

Why?

Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?

Muncie, Indiana. He and my mother met as students. But I'm from Brooklyn. My sisters and I were all born and bred right here.

Uh...  My friend over here would like a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale.

The boys and I were just having a philosophical discussion about women and cigars. Some interesting connections there, don't you think?

You run out of Schimmelpennincks?

Taking pictures?  It's a long story. I'd need two or three drinks to get through that one.

It's my project. What you'd call my life's work.

I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.

They're all the same, but each one is different from every other one. You've got your bright mornings and your dark mornings. You've got your summer light and your autumn light. You've got your weekdays and your weekends. You've got your people in overcoats and galoshes, and you've got your people in shorts and T-shirts. Sometimes the same people, sometimes different ones. And sometimes the different ones become the same, and the same ones disappear. The earth revolves around the sun, and every day the light from the sun hits the earth at a different angle.

Yeah, well, I'm sorry too.  It took me three years to save up those five thousand bucks, and now I'm broke. I can't hardly pay for this beer. Not to speak of having my credibility destroyed. Do you understand what I'm saying? My credibility. So yeah, I'm sorry, too. About as sorry as I've ever been in my whole fucking life.

Good? Of course. Are you kidding?  I'll tell you what. Buy me lunch, my friend, and I'll tell you the best Christmas story you ever heard. How's that? And I guarantee every word of it is true.

Take over the register while I'm gone, okay, Jimmy? 

Once, about three or four months later. I felt so bad about stealing the camera, I hadn't even used it yet. I finally made up my mind to return it, but Granny Ethel wasn't there anymore. Someone else had moved into the apartment, and he couldn't tell me where she was.

Anything for art, eh, Paul?

And now you've got your Christmas story, don't you?

You're looking good, Auggie.

This is private, Auggie. Just between you and I.

Her name is Felicity, and she just turned eighteen.  She ran away from Pittsburgh last year, and now she's living in some shit-hole here in Brooklyn with a guy named Chico. Strung out on crack, four months pregnant.  I can't bear to think about that baby. Our grandchild, Auggie. Just think of it. Our grandchild.

I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.

Why would I lie to you, Auggie? You think it was easy to come here and walk into this place? Why would I do it if I didn't have to?

And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.

Then why do you think I married Frank? I was already pregnant, and I didn't have much time. Say what you like, but at least he gave my kid a name.

I thought I could handle it. I didn't want to bug you. I thought I could handle it on my own, but I couldn't. She's in real bad, Auggie.

I think you'd better stop the car and let me out.

Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.

For keeps.

Anything, Auggie. Just name it.

She made a play for me after I got back, but her glass eye kept interfering with my concentration. Every time we got into a clinch, I'd start thinking about that hole in her head, that empty socket with the glass eye in it. An eye that couldn't see, an eye that couldn't shed any tears. The minute I started thinking about it, Mr. Johnson would get all soft and small. And I can't see getting married if Mr. Johnson isn't going to be in tiptop shape.

Okay, my man. Love to the wife and kids, et cetera, et cetera. Drop me a postcard if you can remember the address.

Come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and we'll talk about it, okay? We'll see what we can work out.

Sure thing. See you later.

For me? And what am I supposed to do with a paper bag?

Your job? You've got five thousand bucks. What do you want a piece-of-shit job like that for?

You're a dumb, whacked-out little fuck, do you know that?

I just do what you tell me, Auggie. You tell me to sweep, so I sweep.

Of course it hurts. What does it look like?

I think I'll take them. 

The refrigerator?

Thanks for the tip.

What does that mean?

Look, lady, that's enough. If you don't calm down. I'm going to throw you out. Do you hear me? Right now!

As far as I know, he went back to his parents.

He doesn't go to the Trinity School?

It can't have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years.

And he's never tried to get in touch with his son?

I don't know. I haven't decided yet.

I'm not going to rob you, mister.  Do I look like a thief?

It'll cost you five bucks.

Are you making fun of me? I won't be mocked. Do you hear me? I won't let no punk kid stand there and mock me!

It's me, honey. It's Mom.

Tick-tock, tick-tock.

Yes it is. It's a law of the universe. If I let you walk away, the moon will spin out of orbit ... pestilence will reign over the city for a hundred years.

That's okay. I've already had lunch.

I mean breakfast.

Well, maybe just one. To be polite.

That's true. But I also owe you something, and I'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job.  What is it? Family problems? Money problems?

Suit yourself. But if you change your mind, here's the address. 

But then you don't get to watch the ball games. You told me you were a Mets fan.

Nice drawing. Did you do that?

Yeah, sometimes.  I like to dabble, too.

How long have you been here?

Take good care of yourself, okay?

You don't really want to know.

If they put this Creeper in jail, then you'd be safe.

What time did you get to bed last night?

Just so you don't overdo it. You don't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish.

No way.

Pick two or three. Now that the coffers are open, you might as well take advantage of me.

His only copy?

Not exactly. I mean, there was more to it than I told you.

That's just it. I didn't think. I just did it.

No way. There's no way I'm giving that money back. It's my money now.

It wasn't my fault.

Good. I'm glad that's settled!

It's all right. I really do know them.

Hot coffee or iced coffee?

Everything is real in here, honey.  As real as the color of my hair.

Yes, please.

Oh, yeh?

Didn't say I was buyin' did I? What you want down?  Just bein' curious, is all.

So the defendant knew the deceased, your son, even then.

That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out for him.

All right, what if the defendant <u>heard</u>?  So Carl <u>let</u> him aboard, to help.  And <u>then</u> the fishing gaff?

So, then, you...and your husband... must have called friends, relatives, to tell them the amazing news.  Yes?

Up in the air?  Was <u>that</u> your reaction?

Why not?

So you hid the truth.  Deliberately.

So.  Wide cross-section of men to evaluate.  And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration.  Did you find him eager?

You bet.  And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.

He didn't want to lose any more.

That's how journalists.  Answer questions.

But even <u>after</u> you had an attorney.  You still claimed to know <u>nothing</u>.  Claimed <u>not</u> to have seen Carl. Am I correct?

I have told the truth.

I had a spare battery in my shed. I brought it down, and put it in just before the sheriff showed up.

Me and Smoltz came on dogwatch September 16.

Don't prove there was two lanterns. Coulda been the one in the cabin.

No, you don't.

Yes, he was.

The knife.  What knife?

You ever been strangled by a single hand?

That you came upon Carl by accident. Like you said.  Gave him the battery. Like you said.  Asked him about the seven acres.  Like you said.

I want you.  To tell the truth.

I told your wife.  Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks <u>believe</u> is true. That's sad.  And it's real.

I don't think so.

He was heavy, but we were real careful.  But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.

She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.

The damage was considerable. But she's insured.  Thanks, again.

Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.

Meaning that he wasn't murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard.

Not in those words.

Such as?

Yes.  And that one, too.

I thought I made it clear I don't want any drinking in this outfit.

All right, girls - from the top again.

It's private.  Go away.

Manhattans?  This time of night?

Yeah.  Why?

Look, stupid, he's ten to one.  Tomorrow, we'll have twenty overcoats!

I thought you weren't talking to me.

But, Joe - three weeks in Florida!  We could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus -

I'll think of something.  Don't crowd me.

Knock it off, will you?

The police?  We'd never live to testify. Not against Spats Colombo.  Wabash 1098.

Quit stalling.  We'll miss the train.

With those legs?  Are you crazy?

Now you've done it!

Boy, would I like to borrow a cup of that Sugar.

I just want to make sure that honey stays in the hive.  There'll be no buzzing around tonight.

Fight it.

You wouldn't hit a girl, would you?

Yeah?  Well, I'm your fairy godmother - and I'm keeping an eye on you.

That's right.

Oh, no.  I'm not getting caught in a miniature sand trap with that guy.

I'm just borrowing them.  You'll get them back tomorrow.

Have I got things to tell you!

But Joe - this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire!

I'm a boy - I'm a boy - I wish I were dead - I'm a boy - I'm a boy -  What am I going to do about my engagement present?

So?  It's going to break Sugar's heart when she finds out I'm not a millionaire.  That's life.  You can't make an omelette without breaking an egg.

Nag, nag, nag.  Look, we got a yacht, we got a bracelet, you got Osgood, I've got Sugar - we're really cooking.

That's when I was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire.

Yeah, but they're not watching yachts. Come on - you're going to call Osgood.

There's a convention, all right.  There's also the ladies' morgue.

Maybe I'd better go before I catch something.

We have some bourbon - lets make Manhattans.

Oh, Sugar.  You're going to spoil my surprise.

Thank you, Daphne.

She'll rub it on me - and I'll rub it on her - and we'll rub it on each other - bye.

Vanity Fair?

Yes.  He wants me to have supper with him - on his yacht - he's going to pick me up at the pier.

Yes.

Junior gave it to me.  It must have at least thirty stones -

Yes.  For a whole year.

Wait a minute, Joe.  Lets talk this over.  Why couldn't we do it?  Last year, when we played in that gypsy tearoom, we wore gold earrings.  And you remember when you booked us with that Hawaiian band?  Grass skirts!

You invest in shows?

Sorry.  I'll be on the bandstand.

Bull fiddle.

Most of the time I slap it.

Wanna bet?

No, thank you.  I'll walk.

Sorry.

Flower girl.

Osgood - I can't get married in your mother's dress.  She and I - we' not built the same way.

Just the two of you?  What about the crew?

It's three weeks in Florida -

I'm not doing anything.  I just thought I'd go home and have some cold pizza -

No - funerals.

Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.

Every time!

Then one morning you wake up and the saxophone is gone and the guy is gone, and all that's left behind is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste, all squeezed out.

You are?

What's in Florida?

Would you mind terribly?

Why?

Well, don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are.

Possible you saw it in a newspaper - or magazine - Vanity Fair -

Oh.  Well, I guess some like it hot.  But personally, I prefer classical music.

Good school!  And your family doesn't object to your career?

I beg your pardon?

I only come ashore twice a day - when the tide goes out.

If it's at all possible -

Maybe you'd better go after him - if you don't want to lose him.

It's all right for a bachelor.

Bon voyage.

Yea, of course.  Now where could they have put it?  On Thursdays, I'm sort of lost around here.

Oh, no!

Have you ever tried American girls?

Thanks just the same.

If I ever found a girl that could - I'd marry her like that.

Thank you.

Good morning.

Me?

According to our tax advisers, she's only so-so.  But - that's the way the oil gushes. A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders - all those little people who invest their life savings -

Make is Scotch.  A demitasse. With a little soda on the side.

I never join nothin'.

Big joke!

Me?  I was at Rigoletto.

I cut myself shaving.

You boys know anything about any garage - or any witnesses?

Spats Colombo.

I come to Grandma's funeral.  Here's your admission card.

If you want a ringside table, tell 'em you're one of the pall bearers.

Why wouldn't I?

So now I got all those coffins on my hands - and I hate to see them go to waste.

So Tony Pee-Pants starts ignoring Kat. He wanted to play with me.

Yeah. Most important day of my life. Whatever. Listen, I chose you to be my Maid of Honor for a lot of reasons: I love you, youre my favorite, and only, half-sister, blah blah blah. But the main reason I picked you is because youve been so miserable for the past few years, I knew you wouldnt outshine me.  But here it is, my big day. My big day. And something doesnt feel right. Maybe it was that pep talk you gave me last night, I dont know, but your misery just isnt working for me anymore.

Its not me. I swear. Its her. Shes magic.

It was just after we moved here. My little girls got in a fight over Tony Pee-Pants and they havent made up since.

Its been my experience that the people who hire a prostitute, need a prostitute.  You did the right thing.

Let me guess. Amy presumed Id forget the rings.  I think Im her least favorite person.  You know, I am sorry.

Its not supposed to be anything, Kat. Its just my rather feeble attempt to.... Oh, I dont know.  You see, I thought I could deny my feelings--

I dont do naked. My sister? She does naked.

He was pretty drunk, but I think hes still crazy about you.

Youre too good for him.

Great, with the occasional stabs of shame. Now, listen, this covers the weekend, but as we discussed, if you want to be intimate, we talk money before anything happens.

I have a friend at the magazine.

I have a different story for every woman who asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me.

This is awkward for me.  Talking about it makes me feel better.

I disappear. Its not about me.

Ive got this bad taste in my mouth. What is it? I think its the words: morally repugnant.

We kissed. Made out a little. Then you passed out.

Not dollars. Pounds.

Believe me, if anything had happened, that would have been one of the highlights. For you.

So, whyd you say yes to me?

Desperation?

Yeah.

Youve always got that to hide behind, dont you? Its just business!

Thank you.

You have more than one gynecologist?

Dad made me go over and apologize the next day.

You knew?

Then for once in your life, do something for yourself.

I say that feeling compelled to do the opposite of your parents is as enslaving as emulating them.

--and The ass of The man who adores her.

You don't live around here, do you?

Is he here in Borderdale?

Thank you, Miss Johnson.

What he talk 'bout?

You could? How?

Not now, David, it's time for bed. You have a long trip ahead of you in the morning...

:HE, JOSIE and EARL, running and playing in the field.

:His visit with his father at the County Jail house --

Charlie, just because a man and his family are colored, you--

Come here, son...

They gone to the field...

Thank you, Daddy...

Well, ain't you gon' open and read it for us?

September 4 -- how far away is that?

Gotta wait 'til visitin' days.

Yes, David...

Tuck that shirt in, David Lee.

Yes mam...

David, come back here!

I can do it, Mama -- you know that. In the Bible stories you read to us, everybody's always goin' on a long journey. Jacob goes into a strange land where his uncle is and he don't even know where he lives, but he finds him. Everybody finds what they supposed to find.

He can't get up, Mama!

Thank you, Miss Boatwright! 

They probly thought you was crazy.

At the way you ask funny questions, Josie Mae!

I brought these walnuts to trade.

I need some nutmeg, flour, eggs, sugar, and...

I'll wait till after the children.

Ike, you could make a song outta that!

Is there something I can do to help you?

It's lunchtime, and I wanna have a talk with you, Nathan Lee. Come on, children...

I wanta see Nathan.

The Canadians are just mad that we mothers here in South Park have the chutzpah to stand up to them!  Like it or not, Mr. Canadian Minister, OUR children are now safe from your Canadian smut!

Montana.

Eric!

What? Fuck you guys, I wanna get out of here.

They're burning all the Canadian stuff cause of the war.

But what are we going to do against this entire army?

Very funny!

Sheet!

Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like Ike!

'Cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and fragile and stuff. I fucking hate it.

It was the Terrance and Phllip movie!

Oh yeah?!  Well you're a monkey-shit-

Tell 'em we'll have pie and punch.

Whoops.

What the hell are you guys doing here?

But mom!  I'm not fucking addicted to fucking bad language!  I don't have a fucking problem!

Yes, hon?

I saw him!! I saw Kenny!!

Eric, that is not appropriate.

Uh, except for you Eric. I'm afraid you need to work more on not saying the F word and the N word.

Norwegian Ass Raper.

Baba mama!

Mrph mprhm mm rmph!

You boys need help.  There are rehab centers that specialize in treating people with chronic addictions to bad language.

KYLE BROVLOFSKI, YOU WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE!!

Uhh... I'm here for La Resistance.

No. Zey must have zem inside. We will have to dig.

We can't leave without you!

Where do they come up with this stuff?!

I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before...

You bastards!!

It isn't fair!

How do we do that?

What has the world come to? This is horrible. We're locked up, burning books, hating other people-

I agree! The only way to save our future is to unite and fight!  <b>Something must be done! We must take action fast! My parents have gotten so strict they forgot they were children in the past!</b>

Dude, I found the clitoris! I think I can get Wendy to like me now!

Wake up, people!  We all have to do things that aren't pretty sometimes! It's the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for! Why do you think children have to be born in hospitals?

-Or monkey fucker-

Huh?

Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.

Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck pigs.

YOU'D fuck your uncle!

I sure did, Phillip!!

Hello, Brooke Shields!

This little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us!  You are a bad man!

Canada is saving us!!

You did? Just now?

You remember... Saddam Hussein, don't you?!

Okay, kid, I have a deal for you! If you want out of hell, all you have to do is collect 10 proofs of purchases from 'Snacky Smores.'  They're rich, chocolatey and really hit the spot. Bring me ten proofs of purchases and we'll grant you ANY WISH YOU WANT.

Hey, come here, guy.

I'm not cranky.  And that futon was not too big to carry myself-

Is sex the only thing that matters to you?

I DO respect your mind! It turns me on! It makes me wanna fuck the shit out of you! Don't you see?

<b>Hey, guy, relax, put out! You gotta relax, shut your mouth- Baby I'd do anything for ya! Now don't make me smack you in the eye like last time-</b>

Where're you gonna go, bitch? Besides, you know that if you left me, I'd hunt you down and kill you, right? I'm gonna go grab a drink.

No! It can't be!

Can we talk about this later?  Everyone is watching!

That's nice, Stan.

Stan... I think you and I need some time apart.

Stan?! YOU started La Resistance?

Cool!

Well isn't that great.  Something to write home about.

Well get used to it, 'cause here we are, on the cruise of a lifetime.

They're not going to make it!

I'm sure I will.

Hello second mate Barnes. I was instructed to come to the bridge.

They are awaiting further information.

Sounds like you've been talking to Mac too much.

Well it's a good thing that I did.

Will you transmit the distress signal?

Sure you do.  Sending Mac out on a little recon work.  How pathetic.  Problem is it seems Mac blew a few fuses.  Or maybe he's just a little drunk. Were you partying with a robot Taylor?

I told you not to try anything smart!  I guess you're too much of a maverick to follow a simple order!  And that's just too bad for all of you now, isn't it?

Good help is hard to find...

Yeah, I know Bill, I came up with the plan remember?  Just have those hangar doors open and ready, I can take it from there.

I know, I know.

Well blaze your ass out of there! You've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!

Let's get something straight, Chappy!

This is a major screw up on your part, goddamn it!

I don't have a problem with it. Besides, you get to meet a lot of interesting people.

Will you shut up already?

Just don't move around too much.

Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?

I don't know.

Well maybe there's a way out of here.

It depends on the condition of the ship.  If I could get to one of the suit compartments I could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry.

Suppose you didn't have to hold your breath?

Even if we do, it might be too late.

Don't worry about me.  Where are we going?

Sure.

That's why we need a safe passage. remember what you said earlier, about getting through the wall? That might just be our ticket.

Taylor!  Where are you?

Hopefully sooner than later.

Over and out.

It did.  It is.  There's nothing we can do about that.

Good.  In that case, I pronounce us man and wife.

Congratulations on your...recent award.

Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.

That is one of my priorities.

There's no time to explain.  Get everyone together!  We found a way to the pods!

He's in the bathroom.

Homesick?  It's only been two days!

Well what would you know about it? You don't have anything to lose.

The engines!

Certainly.  If you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available --

I'm sorry.  The suit compartments are in a non-oxygenated, zero gravity atmosphere.  I'm afraid that's off limits to all passengers.

Certainly.  Anything I can do to be of service.

That's affirmative.

Nope.

He's my dad.

We're looking for Buzz Fazeli, seen him?

Are you guys bruddas?

La da da dalala...

You listen to the feelings, not the words.

It was a clearance.

gambling. And it was a safe place for kids, a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome, clean fun.

Wait! That's an aria!

Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz.

You don't need coffee, Mr. Fazeli; you need a vacation. Sheila catches sight of Theo pulling into the parking lot. She puts a Ken head earring in her right ear. Buzz follows Sheila's gaze.

Theo's bowled on the tour.

We've been partners a long time now, haven't we Buzz?

Simple math, Buzz.  Two plus two does not equal three.

Theo.

It's mine.

I got a right. You're my father.

I couldn't pay someone enough to try to kill me. Sheila comes over to take their orders.

What's it look like to you?

I gotta survive.

I didn't think so.

I couldn't care less.

I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.

I never saw you.

I didn't mean that stuff I said. I was trying to keep you out of this muddle. I'm glad I didn't have my tubes tied. Oh, and by the way, I made a call for you before I - uh - retired. Buzz takes his card and scrawl on the back with a gold pen.

Millie, I know what I'm doing.

Hey man, welcome to our parking lot. Lemme give you some advice, if she asks you to dance, make sure her brother's not around. Somebody blew out Junior's pilot light, if you get my meaning.

You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?

Who's there?

Buzz Fazeli.

Who's there?

You shouldn't touch her.

Nobody touches her. Except me. I touch her. Sheila told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her.

He told me to play Blue-Face with Buzz. I like games.

You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so I'm gonna play Blue-Face with you. 

You made me hurt him!

Someone wants to play with me?

That's right, didn't you have a slight control problem in a recent tournament,champ?  Now go take out your "big four", darling.  Come on, we're making her nervous.

Profits down there, philanthropy up here.  Besides, it beats the pants off bingo.

If it springs a leak, it'll be because Buzz is making waves.

How Mr. Kastle?

See! No feeling. Tell Theo what happened to your hand, Junior.

Look who's talking!

Just because your mother signed part ownership of the lanes over to you, doesn't mean you have a right to tell me how to run my business! I can have my lawyers take that deed away from you like that.  Sheila and Kastle sit up.

Bowling "Center"!

That's right, sugar, find the grip that's right for you. Then grasp firmly. The camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini-green.

No, no, that's too far. Try a more gentle stroke. It's all in the stroke. Go ahead, now, honey - stroke. As the camera comes around the side of the whale, we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman.  His back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it.

Everything has it's drawbacks.

It's a vicious cycle.

So, what about you?

He said he'd sponsor me.

Nothing.

Sheila, please.

Really? I kinda like it.

I may not be a pro bowler, but I'm no amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo.

If you want a professional man, you have to be willing to pay for him.

It's Junior, isn't it.

I told him you were my boyfriend.

I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.

When I'm with you Sheila, I don't even think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately. She stops him and looks around nervously.

At least I'll die smiling.

I didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. He owes me.

Who said anything about an ultimatum? You want to find your father? Get a shovel and start digging. Hurry up, he's probably in Purgatory by now. Sheila makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from Theo. He moves up beside her again.

I am a professional man.

I'm looking for somebody.

If you wanna do business in this town, there's other people around here got more weight than old Faz.

Tell your little pal to let go.

Your time is up, busyboy.

It's burning...

I can't...

Of what we're able to measure, roughly twenty-six hundred feet.

Back away then.

Edmunds, do you have a 20 on Norman?

Two and a half days?

Yeah.  I heard you.

Forgive me.  I've never read the Navy manual.  I wonder what it says about bathroom and shower procedures.

What was that?

Sure.  Each time it started fires inside the habitat.

Why can't I -- ?  What the hell is going on here?

He's right beneath us.

Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have.  This thing is gonna crush us.

Captain.

From what?  What's with all the security?

Storm?  What storm?

Survivors?  No, I wouldn't think so.

Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?

Hold on --

But sir, I don't understand.  This report -- these recommendations... they're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life.

Take a look.

I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us.

All I'm saying is, someone should keep an eye on him.

No "buts".  If he wants to be left, we'll leave him.  Hello?  Yes, the subs -- I want a report...  Hello...  Yes, a report. Gimme... shit.

How drastic?

That's smart.  Let's talk about guns and violence.

If something should happen to us, the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened.

Nothing.  I don't know.  Everything was normal.  No changes at all.

What the hell is going on here?

It's nonsense.  There's enough difference between our own species to prove that.

We're all very proud of you, Harry, but what the hell is it?

He understands me fine.

Duly noted, Ted.  Edmunds, try using suction.

What are you going to do -- shoot her?

Radiation shield, you think?

Maybe it's a message of some sort, you know?  See this red here.

Get out of there.  I don't want anyone going anywhere outside, understood?

Captain, I personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions --

Too big?

I love secrets.

I've read it twice, Norman.  It's brilliant.

That's quite a secret.

Underwater?

We can't go down there.  We're not prepared.  That deep?  That takes years of training, Beth.  We're just scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks.

It never occurred to me.

The timing has never seemed quite right.

What -- are you threatening me?

Get this thing off me.

Normally, I'd say no.  Everything's quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no electricity.  Makes sense.  But what's curious is -- these aren't normal jellyfish.

What?

Yeah, why?

C'mon, Beth.  Don't make this personal.  He told me himself they were taking us back.

Where did you get this?

You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.

Get the helium out of our bloodstream.  We go to the surface now, we'd pop like a soda bottle.

I can't see anything.  How does it look?  Still clear?

My air isn't... I'm coming back.

It's a pretty common place to look for food when you don't think you have any.

Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.

This being after you so carefully fixed my suit.

Squids?

What do you mean, a part of Harry?

But how?

But why is he doing it?

Why would Harry go back to using a code?

Sintag.

Bingo.

Causes sleep.

How long does it last?

What if it takes 20 minutes, Norman? What if it takes an hour?  And he can fight it off?  We can't afford that.

You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.

Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?

You tell me.

Same reason I put explosives around the habitat.  For defense.  For the power.  To protect myself.

No, he isn't.

You don't remember you did.  But I'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get Harry, don't you?  You remember that.

Is it?

It's not me, Beth.  I swear.  It can't be.

Promise what, Norman?  Tell me!

It's not safe for you to be either.

Don't fuck with me, Beth.

Don't you know?

I --

Beth -- gimme the gun.

C'mon --

Let's get out of here, Beth.  Let's go home.

Beth --

Down below, Harry said we would all have to die.  Since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible -- and we all knew -- then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone. Death was the only logical explanation.  But sitting here, we still know.  So how is that possible?  Unless we make ourselves forget.

It doesn't make any sense.

I'm a woman.  I don't theorize.  I only deal with facts.

Another attack?

Harry thinks it's some sort of discharge from our own system, but I've seen it discharge before -- and it didn't look anything like this.

What?

A sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible.

Curious, isn't it?  What's inside? Before I die, I'd sure like to open it and see.

Page 87 of what, Harry?

Did I?

When I woke up, nobody was here.

You didn't say that about the food?

Wisconsin?

Two and a half minutes.  Once we're in the sub.

I'm trying to keep balance with --

Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here!

No idea.

Nine hundred feet to surface.

We all kill ourselves?  Bad joke.  Sorry, Beth.

You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman?

Gimme some room here, will you?  Back off.  Gimme some space.

But it's impossible.

Think about it.

Meaning?

Please.  It must have flown here --

See?  No code.  What'd I say?

Really?

Huh?

Who's everyone?

Geologists?  At a plane crash?

Sure, why not.  Give him the trophy. That pretentious son of a bitch.  You heard him, Norman.  All that "someone went to a lot of trouble, try again" bullshit.  And "impotent".  Where does he get off saying I'm impotent?  He's a fucking self-righteous, little prick.

Barnes didn't know.  Couldn't get a reading.

Not that I know of.  Why?

He didn't say much at all.  Honey --

Keep watching the news.  Are you watching the news?

... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments.

What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good?

I am the son of Annikin Starkiller.

But you are... I know your 'Diary of the Clone Wars' by heart.  My father...

You could put it that way.

Yes... the Force... something horrible has happened.  I couldn't see what it was, or where it was, but it was terrible... terrible beyond description... the cry of millions dying at once.

All you have to do is lose your thinking self.  Don't focus on anything.  Let your body do your thinking... You have to learn to act on what you feel, not what you think ... If I had the crystal, it would be much easier.  You could feel the Force immediately... but for now, let yourself go.  You'll pick it up... and someday you'll have no need for that pistol either.

Stop thinking, and start feeling. Let yourself go.

But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?

At least you're doing something... I'd give anything to be in your position.

Yes, sir.

I'll make a report later.

Send one squad up.

I'd like to get paid before that eventually.  I don't plan to stick around for the fireworks.

We have a little business to take care of first, but it shouldn't take long. We'll be back shortly.

All right, all right! You've got a ship!  But where do we go from here?  They probably took her to find the hidden bases... I don't see how we can find the rebels before she breaks.  The Empire has already beat us out.

Not if this tunnel deadends.

Come back here... Where are you going?

They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.

There'll be time for that later. Now let's get out of here.

Thank you, sir.  I'm See Threepio, Human Cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo Detoo.

Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back.

Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.

I read you sir.

Are you there, sir?  We're going...

Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys !

I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool.

Death to all bugs !

I didn't see him !

Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers.

What's the hurry ?

Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?

Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?

Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?

Don't you have to finish the game ?

This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.

Oh, I don't know... Depends on who you are spending it with.

Funny...

Excuse me...!

You're upset, that's alright.

Your turn...

Who ?

Aw, c'mon, it's just a bug.

Good luck at the academy.

I can't help it.

My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something. It was sweet, but it took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go.

I try just to be happy I'm still alive.

I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet !

That was just a mix up.

We've gotta go get her !

He requested a combat assignment. There's always a need for experienced pilots on the ground. I had no choice but to let him go... He said you'd understand.

Ibanez...LET'S GO !

Captain, we are in the path of an unidentified object moving at near light speed...

You saying you didn't ?

I don't stay where I'm not wanted.

I said no. Want me to pull rank ?

I'm on it !

All bands.

Looks like rain.

I won't quit !

No, sir.

I want to be a citizen because... well, because of my girl, sir.

I hope so. I hope you don't ruin your life over some silly little girl who wants to look handsome in a uniform.

Hi, mom.

I've made a mess of things. I've been so stupid...

You can never be sure.

I get it. This is the part that's best for both of us. Don't do me anymore favors, eh ?

Move out.

Been better, buddy.

SHUT UP, SIR ! We need pick up now !

Then I hope you have a crazy pilot ! Keep the line open, Dizzy !

The difference lies in the field of civic virtue. A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life. The civilian does not.

Yes, sir.

Looks like a bug was in his brain, sir.

We're not leaving you here, sir !

V'ger is that which programmed me.

Who is V'ger?

You may proceede.

The Creator has not answered.

V'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information.

Carbon units have clearly retarded Enterprise's proper evolvement.

The carbon units are of no consequence; V'ger will determine their purpose.

V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir -- that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect...

It will... take me from <U>you</U>...

Spock...!  Get a fix on his position!

You are what...?

-- You, personally, are assuming command?

May I ask Why?

Admiral, this is an almost totally new enterprise. You don't know her a tenth as well as I do.

Mister Decker; every minute brings that object nearer Earth!  Engineering! Stand by for Warp Drive.

I'm aware of that, sir.

Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two and a half years. That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's design -- in my opinion, sir, seriously jeopardizes our mission.

Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications.

It's taken control of the computer...!

This served the purpose.

That probe in there -- in a different form now -- is the same thing that <U>killed</U> Ilia!

It seems we <U>all</U> imagine God in our own image.

A tractor beam...

   We have twenty-one minutes. Captain,    we can still save V'ger... and ourselves.

No more than I expected  Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry...

My oath of celibacy is on record Captain. May I assume my duties?

Twelve seconds...!

Thrusters at station keeping...

Starfleet, boost your matter gain; we need more signal!

That inquiry invades my personal life, Captain.

Any reply from them?

Our... 'insignificance'?

I believe the light flares to be energy fields -- undoubtedly part of the vessel's inner mechanism. A technology so incredibly sophisticated that I cannot --

I am uneasy with that being our only hope of more information.

I am seeking answers, Captain.

A life form of its own; a conscious, living entity.

The point... 

Aye, we understand that sir! We're doing our best.

Helm ready, sir.

<U>Urgent</U> signal from Starfleet, Captain!  <U>All</U> Earth defense systems have gone dead.

Evening, Cal.  Would you tell me about it?

Local Drama Group.  Northern Books.  No, it hasn't come in yet.  As soon as it does.  Yup, you too Marge.

Well.  Everybody has reversals.  If you were never down how would you know when you were up?

N'about ten minutes.  What was your movie about?

No, no, I see...

As the Old Mill goes around...

That's that's that's that's beautiful...

Goodbye.

No, no.  Of course, that's <u>exactly</u> what it represents...

...I always thought so...

Yes...

What are you doing?  I love your script.

I love your script.

You'd know better'n me.

You bet your life.  "The mill wheel goes around...some times it's even under water -- then it rises up, as high as it can go..."

They're all preparing for the auditions - your movie.

My glasses fell apart.  I lost the...

"Room Service!"

You have to sign for it.

One moment.

You going to ask me in?

Read the card.

Why?

<u>Please</u>...

I hurt you?

She <u>realizes</u> -- it was not the fire which <u>hurt</u> him...that the <u>true</u> hurt was her. Was her...

Hi.

I'd love to.

Gosh, you look nice.

It does?

People might be better off.  They thought about it, spent the evening back in the...

Now you're talking...

Not without a rolltop desk.

Happen to know where there's one for sale.

That's why we filmfolk get along so well with you farmers.  Both up with the chickens.

What I am <u>saying</u>, is, we have to Look Out For Our Own...Now:  they want to close down Main Street...

Let me review here: You're...what are you...you've...it's all over between us?

Well, then, what's he doing here?

What?

You told me that about the <u>last</u> town.

On the coast?  Of <u>course</u> he's on the coast, where's he gonna be, the <u>Hague</u>...

That Could Be.

I never touched her.  My mother's gr...

I <u>know</u> my lines...

I don't eat vegetables.



I wouldn't tell anyone anything that happened between me and somebody who was my friend.

You want to see it better, we could go out on the roof.

...not if you've got something to hold on to.

Thanks, honey, but, next time, bring two, save yourself a trip.

What...

You can go...

Bob, Bob, stick to the business, will you?

Joe, the writer?

You mind...?

How could she turn on me like that?  I thought she liked me.

I'm ready!

I'm an attorney, if there's anything you have to say to...

Who is it raped you?

I think I should talk to my agent, Marty, you and I should, we should, really not discuss...

He's on the Island, he'll be back on...

Why?

I like you, too.

I...

She came in here, wait, she...I was giving her a massage...wait...Wait!  She came in here...she...  ...with respect...she took off her clothes, and she got in <u>bed</u>, I told her I could not--we don't know each other, you see...

How can I thank you?  How can I repay you for this part?  It's a...what a, thank you for this part.  The first scene at the Old Mill...

Yes, but, Joe, <u>Joe's</u> been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, "Thoughts," about...

Yeah.  Joe?  Would you, uh, tell Claire the, uh, the "thoughts" you've been...

Listen to me:  Elanora <u>Duse</u> was playing Hamlet in London in 1905, and Royalty could not get a ticket.  She said, "I'm not doing the seven shows a week I signed for."  She said, "I cannot bare my soul seven times a week.  I am an artist. I'll do four shows a week."  The greatest actress of her time.  You know what her Producer said?

I...

...she has a <u>home</u>...

He's staying here?  Bob Barrenger is staying he...?

She won't stop crying...

Her religion bars her from fulfilling her contr...

Main Street.

You were in the car with Bob?

I want to talk to him.  Would you ex...

Eight hundred thousand dollars in cash.

No.  No, but we're planning to.

You should.

We're very upset with her.  Get someone to <u>double for her</u>, her tits, the tits scene, call L.A.  I want to see some <u>pictures</u> of the women's <u>tits</u>.  Of their <u>tits</u>.

Some, you were, you were going to make a reservation for us?  Where's my schedule? Where are we <u>booked</u> tonight?

You what...?  Is that on the callsheet, is that on the callsheet, or is that <u>personal business</u>?  Ah, Christ. <u>Marty</u>...Are we <u>paying</u> you?

You built an Old Mill in New Hampshire...

I can only write on a manual.

I hurt my finger.

...she keeps her back to the camera...?

I'm gonna nail it.

He's got a date, he's got a date, is this guy fantastic...?  Already he learned how to write a movie, and he found a girl to get his toes curled, what a guy, what a...what a literary find...!

The girl was in the car.

For what cause?

I...

I can write it.  I can't type it.

No.

I didn't say anything to them.

I don't know.

You told me you were writing.  Don't you wear your reading glasses to write...?

What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?

That's why I <u>want</u> it.  Type it up and get it back to me in...

Find the money.

If you do the product placement...

Is he cool or angry?

Aren't these <u>illegal</u>?

...we need the shooting permit for Main Street...

...it is?

George, that is so kind of you.

So we just got lucky.

I saw Budgie Gagnon, leaning on the bank of the building.  Said, "What are you doin'?"  He said, "I'm waitin' for the 'leven o'clock crossing..."

No, I'm serious, election's coming up, a lot of people are pretty upset...

It takes all kinds.

Givvem a cigarette...

Wally, I got to takes out that window from the dog.  I can't shoot through...

I have to work on my video project! Don't follow me!  I can put myself to bed.

Look if the truth is you don't feel like talking about this right now that's fine. But don't look me in the eye with a big smile on your face and lie to me. Cause there are only so many lies you're allowed to tell before it starts showing on your face.  You wind up looking like...

But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates...

She is but an arriviste.

A debate.  Man's inhumanity to woman.  He's pro women.  I'm con. Ms. Flannery is twisted.

Thank God for that!

And this is my room so get out!

No, <u>his</u> mother's always on time.

That's because your mother is a fine person, finer than I will ever be.  Now, just this once...

Not use my words, please!

Cos she loves you.

Thank you Ben.  That was so sweet of you.  Goodnight Annabelle.  Sweet dreams.

No!  You're cheating -- you have to start from the beginning and you have to read the whole thing I can't sleep otherwise.

Doo-wop-doo-doo, <u>doo</u>-wop-doo-doo...

I noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer -- perhaps Rachel's underpants are in there -- Now where are your lunches?

Thank you Ben.  Annabelle!

Ben, mommies work too.  They work very hard.  Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working.  I just don't get paid.

Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.

Is your bad?

How do you know?

Oh.

I helped.

Rache says it's from you.

At first.  Then, after awhile, some chemo.

Let's take our best shot.

Look, I will <u>send</u> a P.A. to pick up the children.  There are <u>agencies</u> that supply sitters, nannies...

Remarried.  There is no move.

We're not discussing your age.

Easy enough.

Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?

Never stand between that kid and a meatball.

A lot smaller.

This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays.  I got it right here...

Can I please have a cup of coffee?

I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.

Think twice.  Before you <u>ever</u> pull that again.

Well, maybe they would if they thought it was okay, with y...

Those are <u>my</u> children you're practicing on.  They deserve <u>first-</u> rate care.  Every minute.  Of every night.  And every day.

What?  And have Federal agents jump out of the bushes with court orders? How many years do you get in this state for giving second-rate care to minors?

Don't flatter yourself.

How the hell would you know?

How would you know <u>anything</u>?

You are <u>marrying</u> the <u>greatest</u> guy who walks this <u>earth</u>.  Who I have <u>loved</u> from my <u>heart</u> for twelve<u>years</u>!

Right.  Which is the whole <u>point</u> of this 'going out' thing, so one of them can dump the other one, and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy, without ever having to actually date.

Beats me.  Ask your mom.

It's promising, this one.  We're upbeat.

You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.

And you said...

Thanks, but it's under control.

It's <u>covered</u>, okay?  I appreciate your concern.  Can I talk to her?

Do what you've worked your whole life to do?

Juggle it!  Move the darkroom into your house.  You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway.  Don't lose your confidence.  Don't lose your edge.

Yes.  I made the choice that was right for me.  And I don't regret it.  But even for me, there were days when I felt so lost, so invis- ible.  And then I'd hate myself for the kids not being enough.

I just want to spend time with them when I'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or...

Feeling the pressure?

And her...?

He looks familiar.  Did he do a Calvin Klein ad?

Are we.

Don't be too sure.

Worked.  Like a charm.

You weren't passing 'em out.

She wasn't steering her own course, she was steering <u>yours</u>.

Double.

Come on, a wuss like me?  The stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back?

He only remembers I <u>found</u> him.  My point is, telling you this story would have been the kindest, most helpful thing I could ever have done for you.

I have their past.

I didn't want to spoil our supper...

They don't hate you --

Rache, get out of th...

I think so...What do you think?

Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?

I know that.

...while she watched the kids.  Then, you booked this flat in Paris for your family's summer.  But she said...

How about the promises we make to our kids?  About <u>their</u> future.  Do we shrug those off, just that easily?

I'm gonna get me a drink.

Tucker hasn't penned Ben's present yet -- it won't be too much longer.

What?

Hmmm...Do I know any...personally...?

Thank you.

Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.

We had to work. My family was poor.

My baby.

Jesus was not bad.

You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.

Hip alternative types who will understand the process better

Yes, Mikey?

Of course, honey. Come in bed with us. Come on.

Is everything OK?

But then, in a sense, since you would never have met Dad if your family had stayed in Europe...if it weren't for Hitler, none of us would have been born.

Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.

I was never much of a sweater. You know that.

Don't be so upset. It's OK...

You know he hated my story also.

Patronizing fuck! If you had just been honest with me in the first place I wouldn't have read it. I knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I believed you!

You're absolutely right. The focus is on the college admissions process today.

I'm going in there.

Man, it's just, like, conversation.

Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.

Gee, you're home early!

Well, now you have.

Uh huh.

Good.  'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...

And I also agreed with what you said today about Marcus's story. It is a piece of shit.

No.

Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'

Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?

That's what I was gonna ask you.

Oh. So what did you do after you gave up on acting?

I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like - I mean, I have some dignity.

I'm a documentary filmmaker.

Three.

I know.

No, thanks.

No...Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker?

Well, no. I'm doing one on high school students, in fact.

Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.

Sureumyeah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know.

I dunno. I'd like to be good at something. It doesn't have to be TV. I mean, it could be movies...Anything. I'd be willing to direct.

Oh.

Don't be. Your movie's a hit.

I now understand the expression "you get what you pay for!" A bunch of chumps!

What are you going to do, Cooper, throw yourself on a Bunsen burner? It's a bunch of businessmen touring a lab.  We'll be out in no time.

Because I'll be firing at them.

I don't see why they wouldn't be.

I don't want any...

Chemco's been developing nerve gas?

He's in there...

She's as good as gone...

Chemco is willing to deal with him, meet his demands.  I can have the money there in an hour.

I'm sure you'll figure it out.

What do you mean?

What the hell is it, anyhow?

We're secured.  Takeover team is in position and accounted for.

Why should I worry?  Is there a problem?

Dissent?

If I don't get power up we are!

The thing weighs more than a ton-- you want to roll up your sleeves and try it?!

What does that mean?

Yes, of course.

It is buried somewhere in the Grudd Mountains.

The report is entirely untrue.  I can assure you of that.

It is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man.

Goodbye, Mister Ambassador.

Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...

Who the hell do you think you are, sir???

Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.

Look, General Ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd Bomb Wing to attack with H-bombs.

Look, Colonel.  Maybe it's too late. Maybe they've sent Air Command in already.  But we've got to try to con- tact somebody.

Now look here, Miss Pietraszkiewicz, this is Air Command Headquarters calling.

To be perfectly honest, Mister President, we really aren't sure.

I am aware of what a condition red alert implies.

This is General Ripper speaking.

Yes, sir.  What's up, General Ripper?

That's right, sir.

Yes, sir.  I just thought of something, sir.  How do I know I'm talking to you now?

No, sir.

Plan-R????

No, sir.  Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing.

Thank you, sir.

Yes, sir.

Please don't take any notice of this weapon, Major.  I love all weapons, and as of late, I've just taken to keeping a loaded weapon nearby at all times.

Yes, sir.  General, can I ask a question?

Well, sir, I was thinking, if an enemy attack is in progress, how come the radio's still playing music?  It's supposed to go off, and all we should hear are Civil Defense broadcasts.

Well, I was thinking, maybe an enemy attack is not in progress?

But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.

I know that, sir.

I've given it alot of thought, Major.  Don't think I haven't.

I know so, Major.  I know so.  And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.

But war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?

Well, sir, I remember an example that pointed out that if a system was safe on 99.99% of the days of the year, given average luck it would fail in thirty years.

Well, I'm not, sir.  Honestly, sir.

General, what's good enough for the President and all the experts he's got working on the thing, is good enough for me.

Major, I happen to believe in a life after this one, so I believe I will have to answer for what I have done.  I think I can.

What the hell is Plan-R?

I want to talk to General Ripper.

General Faceman, what was the name of the officer who called me from Burpelson?

Well, the Premier doped it out pretty well. Its primary is their missile base at Laputa.

No, they wouldn't send us in with bombs on an exercise.

What?

Roger, keep calling them.  Knock off auto-pilot, Ace.

Maximum ECM!

We'll worry about that later.  Okay, I'll take damage reports.

Lieutenant Quiffer, we're all sorry you were hit, and we'll help you stick it together as soon as we get squared away.

Fighters closing fast - range fifty miles.

Sure, I'll take her up right now.

Skip it and jump, damn you!  This flak's so close, I can smell it.

Well, if there's a war, they must have hit us first.

Bomb doors circuit is green, bomb release circuit is green, bomb fusing circuit is green.

Lothar, get up here fast, and bring your First- Aid kit!  I'm hit kinda bad, I think.

Listen, give me a shot quick!

What are you talking about?

Look, this is different.

Right.  So how could we get any messages?

But the code is made up by General Ripper, and he's the only one left at the base who would know the code.

Sorry, King.

But how are we going to drop the bombs if the doors won't ---  Hey, King....you're not thinking of --- You don't mean you'd --- ???

Would it matter if they hit at a flat angle? I mean, do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger?

Roger.

Now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for, Lothar?

Listen, Lothar.  You know that crack I made about your...butt?

But, look here, Von Klutz.  Won't this nucleus of survivors be so shocked, grief-stricken, and anguished that they will envy the dead, and indeed, not wish to go on living?

Wait. Racism? You don't know anybody who's black!

Well, sure, he's rich and he's famous. He's got everything and you've got nothing.

Yeah, when's he coming?

Oh. Well, what's it on?

A cloud?

Oh.

No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.

Right now?

Needs some pizza in his diet.

Buff, that slice is the difference between life and death for some half-dead Bangladeshi.

He's around and, you know, maybe he's coming by. Sooze told him to come by and hang out, whatever. It's no big deal. Me, him, and Sooze are gonna...

Yes!

Oh, I'll bet you he has a babe with him right out of a triple-x video. Oh, oh, Pony, come on, give it to me! Stud! Oh!

Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that?

Ah!

Okay.

So, we're all old friends of Pony's. We go way back to our childhood.

No.

Buff, look at me for a second. No, this is serious.

You know?

What, they're looking for her?

Look, Tim confessed to me last night.

Jeff! Let's go!

Come on.

So, how was the ride, kids?

Really?

Mm. You know, does he tell you about how, uh, Jeff, Pony, started the band...?

Yeah.

Shit.

Alright, Pony!

I will.

Look, look, I'm not joking around now, okay? Come on, let's go, let's go!

Glad it's okay.

Good. See you later.

Oh, thanks. Thanks.

Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.

Please.

Hey, thanks, man.

No man.  He's probably the most famous guy that'd ever come in this place. You're lucky he's here.

Okay, come on. Time to slow down.

No, not really. I come from an "area". Bel Air.

Maybe upper-middle-class.

He is.

Mm.

Military marching bands.

Now, how the hell would you know what I think? Hm? You don't know me.

Really?

Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica?

It's nice to do a lot of things.

I'm not a nice guy.

Yeah?

No, no, see, you, you don't understand.

Oh, sure.

Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home.

Mm-mm.

Yeah, well, he's from a Third World country. He doesn't have it easy.

Yeah, well, that pizza could feed a family of four in Turkey or India or wherever the fuck he comes from.

No. We were just gonna go someplace or something to...

Sooze wants to see him.

Why don't you write a song about Sandra Berhard's salad, asshole?

Right on. You know what? He doesn't need the limo, man.

Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?

No.

Fuck 'em! Fuck 'em all, man!

Because I was fucked up, man. I just kept hittin' her till she didn't move anymore.

Why, why did you start this in the first place, man? They never hurt you.

That, that's Indian?

Look, your trespassing.

Yeah, well, thank you for the advice, but you wouldn't understand what is going on with me.

Okay. Nazeer, okay?

Mister Brooks has had shows in New York, Jeff. He's been reviewed in Art Forum. I think he knows.

I'm trying to communicate how I feel, Jeff. You know raise consciousness. Make people think for a change.

About what?

Like what?

Hey!

But do you stand for anything?

Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.

You know, all you know is what's good for you.

Well, if you love him so much, why didn't you go see him play?

... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.

Did it ever occur to you that I might have some feelings about you moving to New York?

Nothing.

Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?

Mm-mm.

Hey, where did you go? We were worried about you.

No, I mean it. No, look, when, when I got out of the car I walked all the way here.

Is that a threat?

No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.

Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?

Oh yeah, yeah, we're starting to get good placement and shit like that, you know.

Nah, nah, nah, nah.

The road's hell, you know? I mean airport, hotel, show. And airport, hotel, show. Airport, hotel, show. I mean, fuck, man, you know? You still living at your mom's?

Hey, I though you guys were coming to the show, man?

Yeah, really.

No, no, they, uh, you know, that can be kind of a hassle, so , uh, you know, I just stay at the Four Seasons. It's easier.

You know what I'm saying?

Oh, no, no. Uh, uh, George, pull over.

I'm gonna go to the car for a 'sec. I'll be right back.

Yeah, yeah. That's the fucking problem.

Hey!

Oh, uh... uh, the other night our manager Danny took us to this restaurant and there was Sandra Bernhard.

Oh, uh, we're gonna go in the studio and we're, we're doin' a new album.

I'm always serious.

Oh, no, man. I can't.

That was so great!

I can't believe you're still here.

Yeah, I have, I have, yeah.

About what?

Well, Dad, she said she wanted to suck my cock.

Don't do that, man, okay?

If you hit me...

Uh, eleven twenty-five.

It's not the air force anymore, Scuff

Don't swear it's impolite.

You just became a statistic!

It's twins!!

Everything's fine.  I'm just having a little trouble keeping my frown upside down.

Di?  I just called to say that Conan talked about us again last night.

If you don't - can you still afford to go to Harvard?

So then this isn't crazy.  It's a sure bet.

Spit from your dad?

Yeah.

Jus some girlie things for the squad.

He is the Great One...

Stop, you're gonna make me cry.

Oh - okay, we ain't done with this... Those babies are gonna get a good start in life - with a real crib - one that costs a shit-load!  We're gonna learn how to rob a bank from the only people who really know how to do it - criminals!  I'm gonna visit my mom!

Hee-hee-h-wait a minute.  Hold on, now. What do we do before a big game?

Just call me later.  I gotta get some smokes for Grandma.

Kim-Lo?

Okay.  How much ammo you reckon you'll need?

I know, Hannah.  Look, I'm not going to get an abortion.  I mean, I always planned to get married and have kids - I'm just going a little out of order. Kinda reminds me of another young lady who found herself "with child," unmarried, on a long road, with no place to sleep.  'Course, that was a long-long time ago.  But no matter what, she held her head high and said... "Pappa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep.  Pappa don't preach, 'cause I'm keepin' my baby.  Hey.  I'm gonna keep my baby." The great one...

Don't Martha-fucking-Stewart me!  If you don't like it - you try being a pregnant teen!

It wasn't like the prison we saw - all these women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy lives they'd lived!  Oh G-d, I'm gonna be someone's bald bitch!

Hold on...

Yeah.  "Itchy" sent us.

I can tell her you're all tied up in the projection room.  I can give her the brush ...

You'll pardon me, Norma? Why don't you just sit and watch?  O.K.  Here we go.

Let it ride for a while.

Where's the bar?

The greatest.  They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors.  Hey, easy on the punch bowl.  Budget only calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.

I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?

I'm sure you'll be glad to meet Mr. Gillis.  He wrote it.

Schaefer.  Betty Schaefer.  And right now I wish I could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me.

I just think pictures should say a little something.

What for? To recover that knife you stuck in my back?

Thank you.

How about the Rainbow Room?

As for instance?

Are you hungry?

Life can be beautiful!

You don't know how glad I am to see youl

You did?

I've got twenty pages of notes. I've got a pretty good character for the man.

You know, I'd take you up on that in a minute.  I'm just not good enough to do it all by myself.

I'll make it short.

I'm not good enough to write it alone.  We'll have to do it together.

You're tough, all right.

Came  on back.  Let me show you where it fits in.

What's good about it?  I miss him something fierce.

Second generation, huh?

Nice job.

Three cheers for Betty Schaefer! I will now kiss that nose of yours.

Twenty-two.

Whose?

Why did she call me?

If you love me, Joe.

We'll be working again, won't we, Chief? We'll make our greatest picture.

It is not.  Get out.

Get out.

Don't get sore at me.  I'm not an executive.  I'm just a writer.

Sure have.  The last one I wrote was about cattle rustlers. Before they were through with it, the whole thing played on a torpedo boat.

Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.

Looks like enough for six impor- tant pictures.

This is fascinating.

Okay.  We'll deduct it from my salary.

Careful, it's slippery.  I had it waxed.

What right do you have to take me for granted?

Good.

Madame's doctor.  She has moments of melancholy.  There have been some suicide attempts.

We have to be very careful.  No sleeping pills, no razor blades. We shut off the gas in her bed- room.

I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.

I don't know, sir.  Madame made the arrangements.

She never will.  That is my job. It has been for a long time.  You must understand I discovered her when she was eighteen.  I made her a star.  I cannot let her be destroyed.

Sure we believe you, only now we want you to believe us.  That car better be back here by noon tomorrow, or there's going to be fireworks.

Frankly, no.

Any kind of assignment.  Additional Dialogue.

No?

Did you intend to kill him? Just answer me that.

Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.

Certainly it's important.  It's important enough for Mr. deMille to call me personally.  The idea of having an assistant call me!

Softball.

He will be. In about five minutes.

No, a super girl.

Eliminate her.

You can do it. You're the most powerful woman on Earth.

Yes, of course, it was foolish of me.

And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!

We have to have a long talk about all this.

No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.

It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me.

Just give me a chance to show how much I love you. Love changes everything. Love makes everything possib1e.

What's that?

No.

You can't just abandon me.  Alone.

Miss what?

Yes.

And you think you're in love.

This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion.

It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl.

Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get what I want.

I could force you.

I don't know. You seem afraid.

Well...I guess I can't.

That one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and see how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd hate to lose you, Ethan.

Call me next week. Maybe we can have lunch.

Well, Lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better. Nice to meet you, Jimmy.

The scoop of the year!

You bet your ass.

It was my fault. You aren't old enough to use the wand. I shouldn't have given it to you.

Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?

You're not...an orphan are you?

She's a beast.

But what for?

Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.

I dunno, but he's gonna get creamed.

No, MR. Danvers.

You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville. You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship. Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.

You Scorpios can never take a joke.

I have to talk to you.

You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft.

You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.

It's just one more crime you'll have to pay for.

Not yet.

Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?

...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone.

What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time.

If there's a way in, there must be a way out.

You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers.

Better than when I was a child.

It's Selena. I'm getting so I can recognise her work.

First the supplier couldn't find the invoice. Then the order came up short. Then I missed the four o'clock plane from Cleveland and had to rent a car, and then I got a darn flat tire on the highway! Can you beat it? Boy, your boss must've been furious when I didn't show up by the end of the day today, huh?

There's no vodka in it.

Brad.

Brad Wilson.

Sure, Lana, I'd love to.

It sure is.

Too much mayonnaise?

But Lana, you could --

You thought that?

Some people don't think it's healthy.

I meant all the choices here. All this --  -- cole slaw, guacamole --  This is some picnic!

Call me.

Can I help?

Lana, I'm from Metropolis. I see Superman every day.

Say!

Exactly what I was about to ask about me.

At one o'clock in the morning?

What about this week's check?

One.  And a half.

Yeah? What do you do with 'em?

I'm tryin' to.

Black or regular?

Destroy the entire Colombian coffee crop down to the last bean.

Yeah, yeah, I can do it.

Not "What." Don't need a genius to figure out "what." Need a genius to figure out "where."  He says I'm a genius, your don --  Brother! Bubba! Your Bubba!  See, if y'all don't want them to trace it back, you got to punch this in from someplace nobody'd ever think off. Some little rinky- dink operation with a little mickey- mouse computer. ROSS It's got to be someplace you can sneak into.

What are you talking about, fella?

God, that's what I keep you for.

They ain't got captains?

Join the party, genius! Come on up!

I ain't about to argue with you.  What's gonna happen to them three? Ross the boss and those ladies?

What about me?

I'm sorry, I'm in a real hurry.  See you around, pal.

Listen, are you sure you shouldn't do something about the bridge?

Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.

I'm in no rush.  So what do you have in mind?

Why can't the idiot in Circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place ---

Couldn't we just get a computer to do this?

He's bound to slip up sooner or later.

Get a hold of yourself, Vera.  Nobody else ever will.

But if somebody re-programmed it, it could do much more.

Today coffee----

We already have a super-tanker.

I could have it all! Holy cats! All the oil! All the tankers! All the pumps! The gosh-darn world will be out to lunch! No heat, no gas--sis, this is some nifty idea!

How? Shoot him? You know about him and bullets. Not to mention knives, tanks, bombs...

What's wrong?

Where did it come from?

Sure! But nobody knows it. Least of all you.  Look, would you mind if I gave you some constructive criticism?

Well, you shouldn't  Be more aggressive, Clark! Trust your instinct! When you see your opportunity, grab it! I do.

But this should be exposed. They get	kids here who are just starting out in life and they take them for every nickel they can get. That's what Perry says.

Oh sure, everything is complimentary. Until you get the bill.

Mr. Smith -  -- the "complimentary couch."

Uh-uh.  Listen, I'll tell you what. You say I'm wrong. And I say I'm right. So why don't we make a little bet on it?

Well, not in your mind, but maybe . . .deep in your heart . . .

Say you love me.

I don't want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell in love with.

Oh, hi.

You're not selfish at all.

Oh, I'm not blaming you.  I just know me. I'd be jealous. Jealous of . . . of all humanity.  Some rival, huh?

Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.

I wouldn't know. I've never had one.

That was two days ago. Frankly, I think this place is a bit boring. It's all white. Why doesn't the guy put up some posters? Maybe some bullfight things . . .

What'd he say before? He saw a girl?

Give it another ten minutes. If we don't --  Hell, I'll tell him.  Pete? If we haven't got anything new in the next ten minutes just go with the wire service copy under the 40 pt. banner and run the picture for three columns.  Kent,	I need a background story for the page 3 sidebar. Give me every thing you know about this terrorist group.

Because that is your heritage. Those are the values we lived by on Krypton.

I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.

Luthor, you poisonous snake . . .

Perhaps a small . . . incentive, your 									Ultimate. A tiny bauble to help me jog my memory . . .

You'll find out, General! And when you do . . .

No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.

No, realistic. There's no magic in the world. Girls just don't get swept off their feet anymore.

But they're expecting us. It wouldn't be polite.

Clark. . . !

You always overreact, Clark. How terrible can it be?

Well, I'm feeling a lot better . . . almost chipper . . .  . . . and all because I had a visit from a very good nurse.

And what am I? A Shriner? No, If you'll join forces with me, together we can make the world safe for war profits again.

And this so-called . . . Nuclear Man. . . of yours can defeat Superman?

N-no...I mean...you bet.

Stuff it.

Forget it, Princess. Clark is the world's oldest boy scout  Trustworthy, loyal, obedient, helpful... and I don't remember the rest, but he's them too. And I promise, he's not interested in anyone like you.

Superman gets mail here?

That's because there's nothing to figure out. Now will you please pay attention. I'm not through insulting your father.

Right . . . you want to tell him how you feel . . .

But why the hair?

Let's try to keep your I.Q. a family secret, Leonard. Before we launch him against Superman, we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction. Kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the Metro Club gala. And once he proves himself, then . . .

Get the box, nephew.

Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down.

Good. Let's hope he stays that way.

For dignity. My reputation is at stake. Just put it on.

I made you, and I can destroy you.

First, I have fun.

Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.

Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .

I'll ignore that . . . So, I created a monster who didn't work nearly as well as I might have liked -- you were clearly his better  --  he needed more energy, more power.

Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.

Still having delusions, Lex Luthor?

Stop saying you know when I say 'y'know.' I know you know.  Yes, I know you're here, Otis. What do you want, a brass band?

He's thirty-five years old.

Thank you.

Albert!

Got it? Otis?

It was hot, yes.

What's she doing in California?

No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise.

I know son, I know...

North. It's north

Actually, she's silver-haired.

Not really, no.

Not really, no.

I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board.

Unbelievable.

You're great with the advice, Clark. Maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column.

Oh sure. A man flies in the sky like a pigeon and it wasn't a trick.

Jealous? Of what?

They will once I hang it on him in tomorrow's edition.

Help! I mean  --  I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it  -  There's nothing to worry about. Help! See.

Screaming

You'll be seeing stars in a minute, Miss Teschmacher. y'know?

What about dinner? I have to worry about the crime of the century, that's all. Y'know? Am I supposed to worry about what's in the refrigerator, too?  What's in it?

First the pets, Otis.

Fifty degrees below and still falling.

I read the article.

I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?

I know...

Yours not to reason why, Miss Teschmacher. Relax! Enjoy it!  Just look at that smog!

Your volcano chum? Your junior life-saving buddy?  Let's get high.

This discussion is terminated. The decision of the council is final.  You will cease pursuing this matter. Any attempt by you to continue, to create a climate of fear and panic among the populace, will be deemed an act of insurrection!

Gets you where you live, huh?

On the salary he pays me, I can't make my rent without it.

Who? Clark? I never cared two hoots for that fella.  Jonathan Jr. That's got a ring to it.

Don't brag now,  Jonathan.

He'll be weightless.

He will be odd, different.

Okay, but...why?  No offense.

Nine to five it's a Pulitzer Prize, I know.

He is. Usually.

Unlisted number, Shall we proceed?

Who's Clark? One of your colleagues?

You think they're strange?

Thirty-five.

195 pounds.

Well, I was born on a planet your scientists don't know too much about. It's in the Xeno Galaxy. Or it was. It was called Krypton. That's K-R-Y-P...

I...uh...check.

It is for me.

Alison Jones.

I'd heard that.  But she's well?

Are you still in touch?

She didn't.

Alison.

I'll tell her that.

Mister, I don't want to know your name.

Not unless you can raise the dead.

Hi, Mr. Ansel.  Hi, Jessica, Mason...

Well, Sam, I might as well tell you the truth.  It's this lawsuit you've gotten yourself all involved with. I want you to drop the damned thing.

Well I don't want a damned thing to do with it.

Can't you make it later?

No.  It should be dry by now.

When the game's over, I guess.

Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus.  He won't want to go.  He never does.  He'll cry and want to hold on to me.

It's natural.

Sure.

Do they have any reputation for drugs?

Did he have any particular problems that you knew of?  Financial pressures...run-ins with the law...

You talked about it?

I did.

Mrs.  Driscoll, if Billy Ansel does not volunteer to say so in court, I will subpoena him and oblige him to testify to that effect.

Yes.

Oh, it's bizarre alright.  C'mon Bear.  Let's get you out of here.

I'll...take it straight.

Isn't it a lovely day?

No.  What's this lawyer business?

Would you like a cup of tea, Billy? There's a piece of cake left.

Oh.

What, Mason?

Oh.

You hate that.

That you didn't die?  Like the other children?

What do you want me to do for you, Mr. Stephens?

I won't lie.

So you can keep on getting well before you have to go and do this. It's not going to be easy, Nicole. Do you understand that?

Will you be spending more than a night?

At school.  She fell for Kyle just before we graduated.  Got pregnant, and...went to live in a trailer up on a woodlot Kyle's dad used to own. Kyle started spending more and more time at the Spread Eagle...

...coming home drunk and I guess feeling trapped by his life and blaming her for that...and...

There's the Prescots...

A car wash!  Wow, I've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash.  Make sure you've got the windows closed.

Yes.

I...I just need to know what state you're in so I know...how to talk to you...how to act...

You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you?  You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer.

What is it?

Who are you?

You can't come here.

You've been retained?

It's my belief that Dolores was doing exactly what she'd been doing for years.  Besides, the school board's insurance on Dolores is minimal.  A few million at the very most.  The really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus.

You remember that much?

Yes.

Before the actual accident?

Why were you scared?

Dolores was driving too fast.

Seventy-two miles an hour.

I told you I was positive.  The speedometer was large and easy to see from where I was.

I was scared.  And there wasn't time.

Yes.  I do now.  Now that I'm telling it.

I remember the bus swerved, it just suddenly swerved to the right, and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road, and then it went over the embankment there, and everyone was screaming and everything.  And that's all.  I guess I was unconscious after that. That's all.  Then I was in the hospital.

You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure.

Nothing.

How will he do that?

No.

Yeah, right.

How do you do, Mr. Falco.  If you know anything about horses, sit a minute.  Help yourself to a glass of this N.Y. State champagne - that's what my husband buys me.

Oh, are you a spy for the other side?

Alone or surrounded?

Just hopping tonight.  Leo Bartha been in?

Don't apologize for me, Frank!

And with ten percent of his future, you're great, too, Frank.

Robard's my client.  I did it for him and his club, not your boys.

Looka, Sidney, you're my own sister's son, but where does that give you the right to call me a liar?

Not in those exact words - you know what a temper he's got.

I don't like this threatening attitude.  When it comes to it, what the heck is it your business what they do, this boy and girl...

I'll by that, son.  Now, you owe ME a favor.  Be good to my kid sister...

I'm trying to get Susie to stand up to you.  But your manner is so threatening that she's afraid to speak!

Why?  Because I don't like the way you toy with human lives? - Your contempt and malice?  Because I won't be the accomplice of your sick ego - and the way it's crippled Susie...?  You think of yourself - you and your column - you see yourself as a national glory...but to me, and thousands of others like me, you and your slimy scandal, your phony patriotics - to me, Mr. Hunsecker, you are a national disgrace!

Ten'll get you fifty you're playing hookey from a padded cell!

Did Sidney tell you about it?

History repeats itself.  Everything that happened to Alan Leslie...began with a smear like this...

I thought we were talking about Sidney?

Susan!...

Bonna sera, commendatore.  Come sta?

I have to talk to you, alone, J.J., that's why.

I like Harry, but I can't deny he sweats a little.

I'll listen one more minute.

Ha!  My right hand hasn't seen my left hand for thirty years!

Then maybe you can tell me if he's as solid as you say, why does he rap me every chance he gets?

J.J., you said you want to help me - prove it!

But not for anything I did today...

How does it matter who's sister? The main thing, they're through and -

J.J., I swear to you on my mother's life, I won't do it.  If you gave me your COLUMN I wouldn't do a thing like that...

- He's got them on him.

Go out with DIFFERENT girls!

Yeah...  And another thing - he's gonna say you 'resisted arrest'...  You know J.J....!

Let's wait till Christmas - it's more legitimate then.

Yeah.  Otis Elwell.  The columnist.

He wants me to break a leg?

It isn't.  I've just seen the early edition.

Help me with two minutes of silence!

Sidney, please, dear, if you feel nervous...

I'm used to you...

Nothing...

That's no way to talk...

Don't you think it's about time you shut yours?  Who are you to tell a man like Frank D'Angelo to shut up?!

Why don't we hear what Susie has to say?

Not to me.  Sometimes, the world feels like a cage.  Then someone comes along and opens the door...and it's never Monday night again...  I wish you and Steve could like each other.

Yes, but why?

But I don't need an uncle, Sidney.

I'm sorry about Steve, not myself. I'm even sorry for my brother.  To be so lonely, without one real friend in the world - to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she's his only real family -

What ship?

Please, Sidney, I can't stand this -

Joan, call a cop!  We'll arrest this kid for larceny!

That was two months ago.  Take your hand out of my pocket, thief!

Well, maybe I was wrong, too... But there's no doubt, Susie, that we have to face some serious things...

You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you come back.

I know.  You told me.  It's a neural-net processor.  It thinks and learns like we do. It's superconducting at room temperature. Other computer are pocket calculators by comparison.  But why is that so goddamn important, Miles? I really need to know, 'cause I feel like I'm going crazy here, sometimes.

Those lying motherfuckers!

Not like me.  A T-1000.  Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy.

We have to leave the city, immediately.  And avoid the authorities.

Negative.  The T-1000's highest probability for success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to make contact with her.

You told me to.

I sense injuries.  The data could be called pain.

Yeah, I thought you'd like this place.

Here.  I wish I coulda met my real dad.

Remember what I said, you can't...

Terminated.

Alright, it!  We need it!

I love you, John.  I always have.

Oh.  Yeah.  They... make me take this stuff...

Remember the message... the future is not set. There is not fate but what we make for ourselves.

You see, Sarah... here's the problem.  I know how smart you are, and I think you're just telling me what I want to hear.  I don't think you really believe who you've been telling me today.

Unknown.

So do you.

Why attack Russia?

Son of a bitch, I knew it!

No.  There is another chip.

Yes.

But I promised your mother.

I don't know. But you and I already know that he has saved lives.

And this, only one of these letters, Major. I have lots of them.

Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.

They're trying to sort out some of the works of art the Nazis stole from occupied territories. Who really owns what? That's Colonel Dymshitz, on the far side.

The British occupy the building where this guy, Hinkel, ran the Nazi Ministry of Culture and it seems they've... they've discovered his secret archive.

Your manner.

Colonel. Pleasure.

What museum?

No can do.

Come in, Emmi, this is your office, too. Emmi, this is Lieutenant David Wills.

Put it on ready to play, and I'll tell you when to play it.

Emmi, stop! I want to show you something. Let me show you something and then if you want to leave, you can leave, please please. His friends, they did this. And he gave them birthday concerts.

That is correct.

That... that was a different matter, I... I was tricked.

I don't buy that.

I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember.

It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me.

I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.

It would be truer to say, I think, that a lot of people in high places knew me.

If you are going to bully me like this, Major, you had better do your homework. You obviously have no idea how impertinent and stupid your questions are.

And when did you first learn that - when you sent the telegram? Was that the surrender signal, the waving of the white flag?

The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider.

You know something? You should've written our insurance policies for us because you got more exclusion clauses than Double Indemnity. What do you imagine people thought? The Berlin Philharmonic's taken over by Doctor Goebbels and his Propaganda Ministry but Wilhelm is a freelance, so art and politics are now entirely separate? Is that what you believed ordinary people thought?

You sure you didn't call one of your close buddies and say, God in heaven, did you see what that guy von der Null wrote about me? The greatest conductor on earth. I want him out the way. He had the nerve to accuse me I am not playing enough modern music. Send him to Stalingrad. Isn't that what you did? You don't like criticism, do you, Wilhelm?  You surely didn't like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you... Are you saying the name von der Null was never mentioned in your talks with Goebbels?

I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?

No, I'm not going to stop it. Hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter.

Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.

Me? Never.  Never.

Of course. You, too. Like everyone else in this goddamn country.

He did?

Son-of-a-gun. We'll find the corporal and we'll find the telegram.

No. But that's why we hated him. We admired him as a conductor but we all hated him too because he didn't have to join the Party and yet he had a better life than any of us. He didn't have to go and deliver a report after every trip abroad. He got everything from them, everything. He was filthier than any of us Party members.

Who's he?

But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday.

Jeez, and I never heard of him.

Hey, hey, slow up, Fraulein Straube has to take down what you say.

Brave?  To celebrate Hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute? Bravo.

Alright!

A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...

Great.

I hate the beige one.



What's it to ya?

It's okay.  Forget it.

It was an honor.  A chance to meet the legend.  Sarah Connor.  Who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. From when he was a kid.  When you were in hiding, before the war.

Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.

That's not my mission.

Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...

It's better that way.

Kyle...

You'll beg for mercy in a second.

You're not supposed to.

Then how are you supposed to get back?

Why?

I'm afraid that's not up to me.

Who is in authority here?

I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?

I can't sleep.

I know.

The stock will turn.

Now, look...

Fine, Dennis.  Soon as I get my money for this week.

What's going on?  I'm going on my second job this month, and now I'm going on unemployment.

You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?

You should be.

I don't understand why they're getting you involved.

If there was one.

No.

I'm not wearing underwear.  Okay? There, I said it.  Satisfied.

I don't think I've ever spent this much time with someone who didn't even ask my name.

Right.  Call me Christy.

Can we talk?

Come here...

Sure.  You alright?  Is this still that contest you're in...

Let me go get some clothes on. We'll talk, okay?  Be right back.

What's wrong?

I know things... like who you can trust.  Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.

Fuck you.

I saw them kill him!

Stop talking to them!

Stop it!

That's my fault.  I get too worked up at these.  I'm very method.  You do know... that's not my name.

Like... where are you from?

Big family... small?

Studied acting, I assume?

So do you.  And to think I was worried...

How long's it been?  Since mom died... four years?  How are you?

I don't need anything from you.  I was laying on a beach somewhere in Spain, naked, and, it hit me -- Nickie's birthday.  So, here I am, four layovers, twenty-seven hours flying and one donkey ride later. Not necessarily in that order.

This isn't an escort service?

Okay.

I said I would...

Just drive, man.  It's fucking nuts!

They're methodical.  They're nothing if they're not that.

You dodged a bullet.

Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing?

Stop this.  It's not true...

Baby, they were all over the house with metal detectors.  They switched your gun with a look-alike, rigged barrel, loaded with blanks.  Pop-gun.

Oh, God yes please.  Thanks, man. I'll take you up on that.

Have you gone to the police?

What happened to you, Nick?  I mean, look at yourself...

What's all this for?

No, I mean, what is it FOR?  What are you selling?

An hour for those... maybe another for the physical.

Cursory examination.  Turn-your-head- and-cough sort of thing.  You'll be out of here in no time.

You mean, I don't like it, he doesn't pay?

What are you gonna do anyway?  You won't get your money back.

Let's get you dried off first.  I might have some clothes below.

Ilsa... you're alright?

He came to my mind recently, that's all.

Was he morose, or...?  I mean...

Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.

It's a private matter, for you... I think you'll be more comfortable...

Look, where is he?!

No.

A Mister... Seymour Butts.

Wanted to wish you luck.  Not that you'll need it.

It was a misunderstanding.

Well, I... uh...

Who's Watts?

I did okay.

No.

All night?

Will the two of you shut up!  God damn it!  Maybe the tests were right, Marrow.  She's sensitive, she's vulnerable, but I don't think she's suicidal and I didn't have to test her.  Maybe she wasn't trying to kill herself. Maybe she was really scared. Maybe she really heard voices.

-- how much is this car worth?

Where in the hell can she be.

Mary, I'll meet you outside.

And after she was thrown out, she needed a job.

Yes, because someone was always keeping me awake.  Ever since I was little.  That was my job.  I took care of my mother and I had to be there for her all night long, and she woke up all the time.  And after she died, well, it's been a few months, but I still, I still wake up, it's... a habit.  I know we've only known each other a couple of hours, but I'm really glad to be with people who let me talk about this.  I'm really happy to be here with you.

But there's a sad catch to the story.

I don't know.

I don't know.  A lullaby I guess. My mother used to hum it to me. And her mother before that, and so on.  Hugh Crain, would you care to dance?

And they're all locked together in here... and he won't let go of them!

My mother used to hum this to me. Like her mother hummed it to her. And my great grandmother Carolyn hummed it to her.

That?  That's Hill House.

Yes.  But I promised I wouldn't let her alone the whole night.

No.  If he's lost somewhere in the house... he'll have to stay lost until tomorrow, until the night is over.  What we have to do now is be together, with Nell.

Nell, what do we do?

Fifteen dollars.

I know.

Maybe you did it yourself.

I don't know.  You've been alone for a long time, maybe you want attention.  Maybe he did it...

Me too.  Although I learned one thing about you, that you don't know about yourself.  You can be a pretty decent bitch.

I think so.

Nell, it makes sense.  It all makes sense.  You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.

No.  You're not specific enough to be a person.  You're more like a vibe.

What kind of food?

Like you.

Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.

Why not?

Come over here.

Fuck you, Mr. whatever-your-name is. This is a lifestyle I embrace.

I wouldn't talk.

Lookin' good.

That's what I thought, man.  But it was not a hotel or nothin' that we went to. It was someplace else.

Sod that.  Gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where I've skived off to.

Fucking out of order, that.  Shouldn't be allowed.

It's only insurance.  Can't be too careful.  This Terry Valentine, he's probably a wonderful fella.  They were together how long?

Well, there you are.  Jen must've liked him.

Gate's open.  I had a butcher's at the house.

Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.

Those aren't guards.  They're valets.

Faith.

You goin' back inside?

You steady on, man.  What the fuck else did you do back there.

Again?

Yeah, I suppose.  Call 'em that, yeah. Down the boozer Saturday night.  Meet some of the lads.

You just cooking then?

Hard to miss.

Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?

Sewing mailbags?  Me?  Never did an honest day's work in my life, dear. Wasn't about to start when I was in stir -- not with all that leisure time on my hands.

Hardly buried.  Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that.

Not ashamed.

Yesterday.  Afternoon.

No, I had -- some other matters to attend to, you know.  Getting a car sorted ...

Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life.  On her own after her mum died.  Aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned.

Various enterprises, style of thing.

This and that.  Y'know.  Ways and means.

Why not.

What'd you want me to do.  Stay at home, twiddlin' me thumbs.  Doing sweet F.A. [Fuck All].

I'll bloody well ask him.

We were <u>lucky</u> to be nicked.  Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday.  Good job we were still breathing.

Just now?  Overnight?

It's true.  Has to be said.  I got off to a slow start.

What about your grandmother?

Do us a favor.  Can't even go have a slash without 'em saying, what're you going in there for?

She never would have turned you in, not in a million years.

You can't count on very many people, that's the trouble.  Number of times a decent job's been cocked up ...

Too bleeding true, 'n' it.

Nothing financial.  Strictly personal.  I can see how all this import-export malarkey might give rise to confusion where I'm concerned.  A foreigner, showing up unexpectedly, like.

My client has already given a statement regarding yesterday's events.

Unless I'm not who I think I am.

No kidding.

Nine years?  Is that legal?

Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching.  Y'know.  Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING.  Or BIG FAT GUY.  SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS.  Wouldn't that be good?

There's more than a measly few grand in this.

Like he'd never hire me for real.  Not week-to-week.  I don't have the credentials.  He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs "plausible denial."

What are you doing here?

Susan.

I don't.

<u>Why</u> then.  Why did you do it!

A spacecraft. I saw the creatures. They led Big Dave onto the craft. He never told anyone what they did, outside of his report. Of course he told *me*. No one else.

I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.

Hello, Tony.

Oh, Mr Crane--

Geez, Mr Crane, I don't know. I hadn't really thought about a career or stuff.

He didn't say that.

Ah... it's nothing.

Huh. Yeah. Maybe...

But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane...

Please, Mr Crane, it's OK, please--

No. Uh... family friend.

Well? How'd she do?

I don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--I thought you taught the, uh, the--

Jesus! The barber! I'll be a sonofagun. Why didn't you say so? 'Course--the barber.

Ed.

Yeah.

Sure.

That'll be fine.

No, Dave, I wasn't.

...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?

Told what?

What happened to you?

Don't tell 'em anything. We're getting you Freddy Riedenschneider.

So... who... who actually--

...who among us is in a position to say...

...Well, he got his mistrial, but the well had run dry. There was nothing left to mortgage; Riedenschneider went home and the court appointed Lloyd Garroway...

Oh, hell. Drink?

Sure you don't need one?

Well, of course, I, uh, it's out of my league, criminal stuff. I do, uh, probate, real estate, title search, uh... I'd be absolutely worthless, something like this. Absolutely worthless.

So--

So, who should I--

Haven't I seen you up in ladies' wear?

He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.

Uh-huh.

Uh-huh.

What the--

That's very generous.

He's the dead guy.

Hey, what's your problem, friend? This is a business establishment with posted hours--

Ah-hah. It would be best if he waited here.

Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow.

Uh... you're under arrest.

Great.

Get his gun and his walkie talkie, Jonathan.  Move.

The cops are non-negotiable, Ippolito.  Why don't you just tell me how this space station works.

That would leave one exit for hundreds of people.  You'd be violating every fire regulation on the books.  We'll guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells.  One more question.  I see a big hole.  If this entire thing is run by computer, what happens if the power fails?

What doors?

You said the system couldn't fail!

It's a little late, you son of a bitch.  There's a friggin' monster loose in here!  Get the FBI, the fire department.  Find metal cutters, cut through.  And bring a cannon.  The damn thing is huge.

Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast.  I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down.

I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?

Who didn't?  Big news.  Out of Brazil, wasn't it?

So the method of death is the only connection?

No.  I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he's a monster.

Go out the north exit!  There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases.  Run!

I know.

Oh shit.

Let me help.  I can take care of everything.

How can you say that?  You know it's not true.

I'm not giving up.

You are this museum.  It won't be the same without you.

And failed.  These doors are solid steel.

What is it?

Keep the light up.  I can't see.

Heel Argo!  Hobbes!  Heel!

Another storage room.

Someone's been murdered.  Not shot, strangled or stabbed, either.  Torn limb from limb.  There's talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal.

Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand?  Impossible.  The sample must be contaminated.

What kind of hormones?

Eats them?

How about lunch?

You were going to be married.

Something came up in autopsy tonight.  Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw.

I don't know.

All right.  If you're positive.

I don't know.  Mr. Pendergast.  Do me a favor.  Get me a DNA readout on that claw.

No.  I think I'm hallucinating.

How?

I have to shoot.

<i>A month.</i>

It doesn't matter.  I'll make other arrangements.

He was tidying up his garbage.  I was going to call you.  But half-way through, he gave up and fell asleep.

What have we missed?

Why would we--

Do it!

Thank you.

Amnesia.

Let's go to some of those viewers' calls.

Certainly a nomination.

Truman, I've watched you your whole life. I saw you take your first step, your first word, your first kiss.  I know you better than you know yourself.  You're not going to walk out that door--

Guess I always thought they'd adopt.

That's right.  Lauren.

If we don't go now, it won't happen.

Yeah, what happened?

Sure.  It's halogen.  Shame it didn't hit you - you could've sued.  You coming for a drink?

Your Dad?!

How about them?

Just between you and me, Marlon, I'm going away for a while.

Truman, you're gonna be late!

Gee, that's great.

I still want to look over a couple of things.

Put some butter on it--or ice?

There's been an accident, Truman.

--What the hell are you talking about?!

Do something...

I spend half my life out in the sun, Mother, why would I need vitamin D?

Things always do--when you look back.

You're welcome, Truman.

Who?

--How do you know about that?

You're not FBI agents.

Nothing completely conclusive --

No. Just fossils, far as I know.

Show you right on a map.

I know the name. Why?

I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned that. OB-GYN.

Before the bomb went off?

Michaud was a patriot. The men he's loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldn't predict.

They want to discredit you -- for what?

Are you saying it wasn't such a small outbreak?

What killed those men can't be identified in simple medical terms. My god, we can't even wrap our minds around something as obvious as HIV. We have no context for what killed those men, or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future. Of how it will be transmitted; of the environmental factors involved.

I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government.

Something's gone wrong -- something unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and dig. Or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, Agent Mulder. When it's too late.

Did you find something?

Nice try, Mulder.

Mulder. Move away from the door. We're coming through it.

They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.

There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore.  Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.

I was until about an hour ago.

There's some kind of cellular breakdown. It's completely edematous.

I'd been told as much.

Mulder --

That I don't know. But if it's through simple contact of blood to blood, and if it doesn't respond to conventional treatments, it could be a serious health threat.

No.  It didn't show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests --

It looks pretty green for this climate.

That's the first question to answer, if we're going to find them.

We've got two choices. One of them is wrong.

I've got to be in Washington D.C. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. And here I am standing out in the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.

They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.

Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop containers out there.

Yeah...?

We're close to something here -- we're on the verge --

I think... something stung me.

Hang on. I'm going to get you out of here.

Thank you.

And they want to blame us?

How deep does this go?

I'm not taking any chances.

I've got to find Scully.

What happened to Kurtzweil?

No! For God sake you've got it all backwards.

That's why you bombed the building. The infected firemen, the boy --

The only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it: those vaccinated against it and human/alien hybrids. Your father arranged for your sister's abduction. He allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program, so that she would survive. As a clone.  He had different hopes for you. That you would uncover the truth about the Project. That you would stop it. That you would fight the future.

I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.

Dr. Kurtzweil is in the trunk.

Driver.

How?

The geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us. About our place in their Colonization.

In hope of what? Learning that it's true?! That we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms?!

Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...

No.

Yes mother.

Why did we stop?

Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.

What happened?

You don't know the procedure.

Not Stargher, not really.  He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster.  And an innocent child.  If I could reach the boy.

Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality?  Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act.  We're all human.

Okay, okay...

Absolutely.  Abigail...

Yep.  Eloped.

It doesn't matter...

's broken.

Mocky-Lock.

You're kidding me.

Catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy.  When we started, there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as "receivers."  All they did was observe and report.  Nothing more.  But Catherine, she had the ability to feel what was happening.  She understood. And the patient responded.  Edward engaged her in dialogue, took her places, showed her things.  He knew she cared.

Awaiting his arrival.

Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.

Considering where I've been...

I saw her.  Julia.  Alive.  I saw everything.

Ja, ja, ja.

I was told there were only two men there.

Well, if I do find out something, can I look you up again?

Just another part I've got to learn.

What's that?

Where is she?

I thought you wanted...

Wait here.

Seventy pounds a tube. He wanted me to write for his great medical charity.

There isn't enough for two laughs.

I shall be all right.

He's safe in the Russian zone.

If you want to sell your service, I'm not willing to be the price... I loved him. You loved him. What good have we done him. Look at yourself, they have names for faces like that.

They're Harry's.

We loved each other, do you mean that?

I don't know.

That's all right, miss, don't worry. We're used to it - like doctors.

No, not yet.

Once in a while.

What?

Well, you could say that murder was part...

Getting around, Martins.

Are you too busy chasing a few tubes of penicillin to investigate a murder?

I'm not asking you to.

Which side of the road?

She's right. It's none of my business.

I said you win.

I'll be your dumb decoy duck.

I'll do what I can, if she'll let me.

Well, there's not much time.

I haven't got a sensible name, Calloway.

You know, Paine's one of your devoted readers. He's promised...

No, no. Leave them for a while.

No, I don't know...

I'll tell you what, Mr. Martins. On Wednesday night at our institute, we are having a little lecture on the contemporary novel...I thought perhaps you'd like to speak.

Nonsense. Your novels are very popular here. Aren't they, Sergeant?

Oh, that is Mr. Martins' little joke, of course...

Never heard of him.

It's good to see you, Holly.

She's been arrested.

And - Anna...

You've got plenty of contacts.

What do you want?

What did he say?

But he said he died instantaneously.

All right - I'm mad. I've seen a ghost...

Yes.

English?

Who?

Mr. Lime's.  Accident...

Mr. Lime - yes.

You saw it?

Er, alive? He couldn't have been alive, not with his head in the way it was.

Who else?

I am not a bad man.

Funny?

A novel, Mr. Martins?

Yes.

Why no, Mr. Martins.

Never.

Here.

Thanks.

Good morning.

Of course, but look; all these people. If that place existed, they'd all be there.

Nice work.

That's the wrong one.

So?

I'm sorry.

Was there a shark? Did you see a shark?

It's on an island that no one get to.

There's midrash supporting this. My father read a book by Shalom Spiegel that -- Isaac actually died and was reborn.

I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau....

I rest my case. He's a Jewish Nazi. He always was.

They don't have extermination camps.

Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?

Fire...

No, you don't.... If you hated them, you'd study them, so you'd know why you hate them. You know what tefillin is? Tsitsis? Shotness? You know the kaddish from the kiddush?  Eichmann? He went to Israel. He studied the Torah, the Talmud, the Mishnah, the whole bit. He hated Jews.

Why the fuck not?

I just read it....

I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that.

That's stupid. Why would they?

Yes, I am. Basically I am.

Oh, really?

No.

No.

Why not?

What assholes.

Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's not about belief.

Is that why you became a Nazi? So you could talk about Jews incessantly?

Okay...  Why don't we light candles on Friday? Let's light candles.... And say the kaddish.

Lina, come here!

I'm stealing it.

Obviously.

People hate Jews. Do you agree?

What should I be, a white inferior- ist? A multicultural Zulu egalitarian? Let me ask, where are your people from?

Why?

So, fine, it's not that the Jew, the Jews own the media and the banks. It's that they're sexually corrupt.

Of course they're Jews.

Are all Jews the same?

Do you know Rabbi Stanley Nadelman? He used to be at Congregation Beth Elohim in Ozone Park...?

To hear them read Torah.

I want you to say kaddish for her. It's the only thing she asked from us....

...I want you to do it on the outside, too.

Daniel Balint.

Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.

So what Jew would you kill first?

You mean Ilio Manzetti?

Fine.

Lina... It's happening. Tonight.

Lina, you said if I was going to plant a bomb, I should --

The mother.

What...?

Who even knew?

JTS...?

Why me?

...We have nothing to learn from these people. They should learn from us.

None whatsoever. But I have to admit, I'm not terribly surprised.

Yes.  Not like Enzo.

... I'm pregnant, Bonita!

I can't... I just don't know how to...

Like a popsicle.  They're keeping him on a stick until spring.

Remember when I went to Italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium.  Well, we weren't being cheated by the Mafia or anybody except maybe by me...  ... Do they come for lunch everyday? I really went on my own business, to see a man that I happen to be in love with... and I'm glad I did it, but I'm sorry about the policy and I'll be happy to make up the money the company didn't get... of course just now I don't have...  One million, four hundred and ten thousand dollars.  But if you were to dock my salary, say, twenty dollars a week, in a few hundred years we'd be even... and I think this is where you fire me?

Yes, isn't it wonderful?  I'm so happy.  I'll bet I'm the happiest pregnant fired person in the world!

Hello!

No.

Yes, of course, I'll do the Hula!

I get it, Enzo you were a superior child.

No.

Okay.

Sinister is what I'd call it...! Ours is so much cheerful!  Why don't you come and stay with me... There's plenty of room in my suite.

I won't, I swear.

You told Bonita, but you didn't tell him, right?

Don't.

Find the Frenchman.  Find me Mayol.

Eh?  Si!  Avanti!

Smoking is absolutely forbidden.

Noireuter.

Hey!  D'you have any other complaints?  Just make a list and we'll stick it on the porthole! Okay?

No...

No.  All you need is to want to be the best.

That's too easy!  Every time I beat a record there's always some dumbshit asking me:  "D'you know that French guy, Mayol?  He's supposed to be very good!  Too bad he doesn't compete." So, you're going to come with me to Taormina! First, because you're my friend and second, because you don't have one reason to keep on spoiling my pleasure.  ... I'll see you there...

What room have you got?

Not only is Jacques Mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world!  And you're throwing him out!  Are you crazy, or what? Stupido!

Yes, of course.  Lots of questions.

How do you make a living?  Your experiments, does it pay well?

... You married?

Not at all!

I don't want to erase anything.

I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.

We can't dive anymore.  They want to cancel the competition for a while.

I thought it was a nice place.  Isn't it?

Only to help the medics, I assure you.

How do you know that?

I did?

It's me... Johana.

I got fired.

... Not at all.

You'll understand.

Uncle Louis.  He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?

... Nothing.

It's nothing.  Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.

Because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... And I always have a hard time finding one.

I saw how it has to be.

What?

No, no.  It's true.  When I was in New York, oh boy!  Before my accident, you understand? 

It's my apartment.

Oh Jesus...!  I'll make some coffee.  They left the stove.

Don't be a jerk.  There's no such thing as love at first sight.

Do you think I should have stayed? Don't you think maybe I should have stayed?  I've been a jerk, right?  I should have stayed!  I was supposed to be in love... I was in love!  I am in love, why did I act like a bitch?  He went swimming. All the man did was go swimming! I must be crazy.  It was too good to be true.

Of course, that's what they're for.

Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet.  They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture.  At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.

But... how is he going to breathe?

Well, then I've got good news for you. We just got word that he'll be making an appearance at the Mall Of America today. I'm sending Esther to meet you there at once.

One last thing Hammer. You take care of yourself. The...

What's up?

It's Esther.

Well, I couldn't be happier for the both of you.

Sorry I'm late. Traffic was a pisher, and I've been circling the block for the past half hour looking for parking. What are you listening to?

Actually, his days of marital infidelity have long since past. Now he just shtoops my mother exclusively.

He must be behind that curtain. Relax. We're undercover. We need to give off the appearance of calm. You see Esther, the trick to undercover work is to try and blend in. Act as a Gentile would.

Yeah, no kidding.

Mordechai!

Mordechai!

Well I'm just glad you're safe Bubba Shaina, and eating by your mother for Shabos.

...I'm not finished yet, mom.

Happy Hanukkah Morty.

Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.

He's still working out some identity issues.

Now this might get a bit technical, but try and stay with me. Using a highly sophisticated connection of other computators, called the Internet, I can access surveillance maps, villian biographical information, and even sports scores with a few simple keystrokes of this electronic typewriter.

While I was in Taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems, I came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive, Jewish pride weakening substance on the planet. I bought the entire plant.

No, it was the perfect level.

No. I'm airsick you asshole! Where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly?

What are we gonna do? He's got us on the ropes.

Maybe he ran out of ammo.

It's Friday.

It don't look like a leopard to me.

Up at the museum.

That's the place: I remember - My feet were so darn sore, I couldn't make it -- and Galbraith went on up to the head of the canyon by himself --

They're fools. Why don't they let Charlie How-Come hunt it alone. He's an Indian.

Watch and see, A day or a week - but certainly this month -- you will have money from a man and then-

What are you doing that for?

Go on -

You think be's pretty nice, don't you?

You're lucky. I wish he'd front page for me.

I bet you try on my coffin some day -- I hope it "fits just perfect."

It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths  that's what this procession is supposed to be.

Yes. It's always fascinated me.  You know, once, when I was a youngster, I went to see Mrs. Leslie Carter in "Zaza." After the play I stood in the alley just to watch her come out.

I want to ask you something.

Yes?

It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.

Caged animals are unpredictable. They're like frustrated human beings. I can't answer your question.

I can understand about the cat killing the first girl. Charlie How Come told me. All that noise and those lights -- scared crazy it would do anything. Last night there was nothing to disturb it. Just a little girl alone in a cemetery.

We're old friends.

Just barely possible - - yes.

I didn't want to kill, but I had to. I heard her in the cemetery - talking to the man in the auto --

That was a calamity!

Miss Walker -- I didn't expect anyone 

Go on foot.

Why?

You think Galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse.

Yes. And I am taking it to headquarters for examination.

Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...

Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?

No. I thought that might be just a little corny.  I want you to lead him in on a leash.

Look, Kicks, how long have we known each other?

Maybe I want to feel badly.

You're positive of that, aren't you?

Half to the Delgado family and half to Clo-Clo's family.

Maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the Getty Museum...

I am Lawrence, sir. Mr and Mrs De Moraes majordomo. They are expecting you.

Dial O-O-O on the telephone if you change your mind about the drink, sir.

I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.

The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.

Perhaps I should come back when youre...

The man who sold the boy to your brother.

Well, I found a little more than that. Let me put it this way:...  Last night I thought your brother might be dead, tonight Im convinced he is. That said, I have no evidence and I advise you to let the police deal with it.

Have you got a pen?

The Mondrian, room 504. The number is 266 7548, plus the L.A. code...

Sorry?

You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...

Youre mad...

No!

Leon hung himself...

Leon could still have hung himself.

I didnt know my husband and Friedman knew each other. I just...  Do you think we spoke about it? Ive known for five years. Hes known Ive known for five years... But not once have we spoken about it. There are things one just doesnt speak about...

You bastard...

Something like that.

Something like that.

Here we go again.

The dead can wait.

Yes. Im trying to reach a friend but I cant get through. The number is 01766 770 471.

A coffee and a couple of croissants.

A small loan would be welcome. More urgently, I need access to a telephone and an address where things can be sent to me.

Im sure Ill find a way.

A criminal?

What about your friendly cop?

If you have hard evidence about a child trafficker, we want it, Mr Lombard. And we want it before you get yourself killed...

Thats right. Wheres the fucking Italian, eh, Mr French hero?

Have we done business before?

Yeah.

Yes... Good, good...

Where is the Austrian? Is Friedman the Austrian?

...On holiday?

Finsbury Park. Were in Finsbury Park.

The company. We all work for the company.

Just me...  Martins gone back to the Ambassador. Look...

Can I have the reception desk, please.

Got it. Puppies.

No.

Good.

La what?

Should I?

Well, I hope youre not too heartbroken and...

Oh yeah! Better be good and hurry away then! Who knows? We might be being watched! Maybe one of your stupid French companies has got a detective prying into your life - after all, thats what they do to their employees, isnt it? Huh! Hope you enjoy ruining peoples lives. Thanks for the lift!

Bye bye, Jane. And dont be naughty.

What are you up to, eh, Savieer? I mean, not this but... Money, passports, a gun in a microwave? Who are you, eh? Who are you?

May I ask if you are Jewish, Mr Lombard?

Okay. Recommended...

Look Mrs Spitz... I dont know to whom Im indebted for the recommendation but... Im not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references. What I do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not I can be of help. I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs Spitz.

You wouldnt be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.

Do what, Mr Lombard?

He could indeed, Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it.

Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?

Maybe the thought of people like you going on holiday bothers me. Come on, lets go...

Youre making a mistake, tough guy. Whoever he is, your guys not one of Friedmans...

I told you... The rabble, its me...  Huh... Its sad.

Yeah.

Have you?

The ladys not a friend. Shes a whore.  Someone at a special screening I attended mentioned certain goods could be got from an Austrian here in London. And not just movies.

Ill be alone.

Yes. You wouldnt know where I could reach him? We had to discuss an exhibition of his photographs at my Paris gallery, you see? I really need to see him before I leave.

Wheres your wallet? Have you got a wallet?

Good reasons?

My sister... She lives in the next valley.

Hed come prepared. He had something besides Shiva... Sleeping Beauty. The Disney film...  Well, it looked like the Disney film. It was something else. I couldnt watch...

Los Angeles?

I know his work better than I know him.

Could that be Camden Market?

Tu sais où me trouver.

Alors quoi?

If you can, send me a receipt.

Fuck...

Let me give you a tip, asshole - no one pulls stunts like what you pulled in London and here tonight and hopes to get away with it. It upsets people. Its wrong. Fucking wrong.

I can only tell you what he told us...

Dont tempt me. The last scumbag who thought I might kill him died soon afterwards.

Let someone else pretend to be you, and see if...

Tremoille... don't.  Please...

Well... uh -- this might take a little time -- but let me see what I can do.

This I can do.  I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.

How dare you tell me what God tells me to do!

Uh... they said... they will think about it.

But... to be honest... I don't think they'll leave tomorrow.

They've started the battle without me!

Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...

Well...

Yes.  Yes, I'm fine...  We need more brushwood!  Why are you staring at me like that?

What... what do you mean?

You make it sound so simple...

Did your voices tell you that?  You told me you hadn't heard them for months...

To marry you.

Jeanne... I have been hearing voices -- and believe me, those voices left me in no doubt that you must not go to Compiegne!

If God wants me to win, he will find a way.  And if he wants me to die... if he wants me back... then that's fine too.  Then I'll be with him forever.

It would not be the same without you.

Yes yes... any moment... you're always so impatient...

Good.

I made no such promise.  Sound the retreat for the night!

Did God forbid you to tell the truth?

Ah, yes, I forgot... God sent us an illiterate peasant to carry out such an important mission!  Do you think that God made the right decision, to take an ignorant girl to save the kingdom of France?

What are you doing?  This is an ecclesiastical court -- you have no right to do this!

We want her burned as a witch!

How can I calm down when I'm made the laughing-stock of the whole court?!  I've had enough!

Well what are you waiting for? You've got a castle full of racks and ropes and pulleys:  go and torture the bitch!

And God who allowed you to be caught?

No no, I'm fine, really...

What about you?

But where are you going to be?

Yes.  They paid your ransom... tomorrow you will be transferred to their great castle at Rouen.

I don't know what you're going to ask me questions about.  You may ask things that I won't want to answer.

Not unless you hear my confession.

Yes.

I am sent by God, and I submit all my words and deeds to His judgment. Or do you think that you are better judges than He is?

It's not my body I want to save. It's my soul.

Buying her?

I understand.  How much?

For the sake of France, Charles. And for the sake of my grandson.

I assure you, Charles, the Maiden has no greater admirer than myself. But whatever our personal feelings, we cannot allow her to conduct her own private war.  For the sake of the kingdom, it is imperative that you stop her going to Compiegne...

But... her army's so small now...

Orleans has held out for six months. I don't suppose a few days will make much difference.  Take some rest.

Well... we are, of course, enormously grateful for your past efforts, but your task is done.  Now it's time for negotiation... and after many months of skillful work, our dear Tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our Burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the English.  You see, my dear Jeanne... as it is written in the Bible, "to everything there is a season:  a time for war, and a time for peace"...

Why do you have to be so bloodthirsty?  Do you enjoy it?  All that blood and noise and pain? Diplomacy is far more civilized... far safer... and far cheaper...

I'm more interested in what he says, not what he looks like.

I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.

I must offer to the Duke.  I will give you his answer tomorrow.

Yes... they were.

Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?

We're taking back the Tourelles!

Damn right!

Me too...

No good?  This is a disaster!

But the bridge has been pulled down!

I know, but so is the enemy -- they're falling back -- Paris is ours...!

The clothes are not important...

No...

No...!

No!

Sorry Jeanne...  Did you both meet already?

What's the use?  The drawbridge is up!

Won?!  Such a small word will never do!  This is victory, Jeanne, this is... glory!

... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm!  I love it!

My king.

I -- I -- I...

Nothing.  I'm here to set you free...

How can you pretend that you love God when you're about to throw away the most precious thing he gave you? Life is a gift, you should know that by now Jeanne -- a gift from God. You know what He'd say to you, if He was here?  "What are you doing to me, Jeanne?"

Yes!

They're going to come and visit you in here?

Why not?

Because!  Because I've always been faithful to God, and I've followed everything he said... and I've done everything he asked me...

I... I was defending myself as best I could!  Everyone has the right to defend themselves, don't they?  Or should I have let myself be killed?

I don't think so.

And your mother -- everything's fine with her?

Oh yes, my sister's just... she's... wonderful.

Yes, it is.

Well, I try and talk to him, but mostly he's the one who does the talking.

And what does he say to you?

Who wants me to stop?

It's like this... I...we...all of them.

Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's a pediatrician.

I came specially to meet you today. I love your playing, but what a day to choose.

Dorota.

I'm sorry - I was given this address. I'm looking for a Mr--  -- a Mr Dzikiewicz.

He'll be here soon.

Just over a year.

Let's find out.

Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.

What, I'm working, what?

What?

I haven't seen him.

Tough luck.

Who told you?

Who's recruiting?

Okay, then I'll tell you something funny. You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja.

You have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the German firms in the ghetto, otherwise...

should never have come out. I should've stayed there, fought with them.

You're an artist, Wladek, you keep people's spirits up. You do enough.

There are always notices going up.

Not this week.

Fine, we're fine in the circumstances. But I can guess what you've called about. There's nothing we can do; they won't reopen the station--

...not even music, nothing, no radios for the Poles. But I'm sure you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist like you.

Bitch!

You're a dirty pig!

Since last night. I was pleased to see you.

You made contact?

Where are we going?

God forbid!

No, I don't think so?

Don't thank me. Thank God. It's His will that we should survive. Well. That's what we have to believe.

I've got another one.  Warmer.  What will you do when it's all over?

It will be very dramatic.

No sound at all?

No, no bible readers.

No, I love her, we will be a family. I have her piano. I will mend it, she will get better.

It was more to your wife that I gave it.

What are they?

I'm sorry, I can't do that.  I don't have the time.  Goodbye

They are washed.

Yes and so do I, but there are too few of us here to carry it. TOO - HEAVY

Let us not discuss this further. I am very pleased....

Hello.

Take this to Baines. Tell him if he ever tries to see her again I'll take off another and another and another!

Joliet badge, Snyder.  Don't cut much up here.

Maybe I could help ya if ya told me his name.

I don't have to.  You'll be bustin' in on the Chief of Police just up the hall. 

What?

If that's the way you want it.

We'll be waitin'.

The bastard.  He can blow his nose all the way.

Aw come on, it was the only thing to do.  He knew he was holdin' ya back.

You ain't gonna have nothin' if you don't lay off them games of chance. There's a depression on ya know.

I did.  That stuff I gave him was counterfeit.  They'll pinch him the first place he tries to spend it.

Which one?

You sure he didn't just pocket it?

Yes sir.

You've only been playin three hours, Doyle.

What do ya want the others to get?

C'mon, you can do better than that. We ain't no heel grifters.

Just give us what ya can, Benny. We'll send a truck down.

Does J.J. know how to use this thing?

He had you down as a big-timer. What happened?

I picked something up on the way.

You didn't act much like you wanted to learn it.

I gave him the breakdown just like ya told me to.

How many guys you conned in your life, Henry?

Naw, I'd just blow it.

I also gotta win.

If we're lucky, this'll bring him back stronger than ever.

Lonnegan.

Five and call.

What for?  I haven't done anything.

Yeh, I guess I shoulda had the meat loaf.

No.  What's wrong with the front?

No.

Yeh, this time anyway.

You know me.  I'm just like you... It's two in the morning and I don't know nobody.

All right, when?

Well we can't talk in here.  They're having the place painted.

660 Marshall Street.  Tomorrow at 12:30, if you're interested.

This is just a test.  The big one comes later.  Be careful with that though, it's all I got.

You got a system, Carver?

I'm in.

We'll get it, and if we can't, we'll just make it up.  Grand larceny, extortion.  Counterfeiting, anything you want.

All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight.

I could come up with 750 grand in a day if I had a reason to.

Yeh, but I don't know where he is.

Sure.  Every bunco man in the country knows Gondorff.

Why don't you pick him up yourself?

What the hell good is Hooker to ya?

Sexogerarian, eh?  Yes.  Yes.  But I can't put that in the paper.

You know how they are... sex...

But tonight is Christmas Eve!

What are you talking about?

I only know I want to marry you... right now, and --

He's all right.  Isn't that enough?

I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.

Nonsense! She got at she deserved.

Yes.

Disappeared!

I've got to see you alone!

Pretty good shot you are. What did she do?

I bought it in a pawn shop.

He's been dead for three months.

You see how much we have to say.

Wouldn't it be a little embarrassing ...  all of us there ...  your other and me and your stepfather?

You know how it is, Dad.  He's sort of under Mother's thumb.

Must have been in the war.  That might account for the cane and his limp.

She could tell you where father is.

Gilbert!

I'm asking you.

So you say -  Go on, Bob.

Oh, that's a phoney.  The men didn't even have to go down.

They're all O.K.  Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.

I'll check on that.  I'm afraid this is kinder dull for you.

Rosebreen.

Yes.  But we figured it was just blackmail...

I'll take care of him.

--was Wynant's.

Why yes.

I don't think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.

Let him have his say out.

So I see.

What bonds?

Don't you remember....

Hello ....  give me ....  Well ....  ?

Good morning. I'm afraid this isn't a very "Merry Christmas" for you.

So did we.  I mean, Sherlock here.

Would it help any if I could persuade him to meet you?

I trust you.

What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?

I hate to bother you when you're laid up.

Slim.

Hello.... oh, just a minute.  Police department?

Oh he as clever about that.  He called when you were out.  That same afternoon, Julia telephoned to him. She said that you were coming, Mimi, to ask about Wynant. He got terrified. He was afraid that Julia would break down and tell... so he went to Julia and killed her and left Wynant's watch chain in her hand.

Hello, Mimi.

I tell you again, I don't want any part of it.  Now you take Dorothy home and...

Gilbert!  Is he here too?  We might as well be living in the lobby.

They'll want more than your word for that.

Listen.  "Studsy" Burke told me you used to be O.K. That's why I'm here. Do  they....

This is your party.

I hope you won't let this news spoil your dinner.  Nice food, isn't it?

He's well-trained.  He'll behave himself.

Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.

Santa Claus.

Nothing, 'til I find out if it's the gun Julia Wolf was killed with.  Keep her in here, and don't let those reporters see her. They might believe her.

Yes.

Maybe it would if I took it.

Tomorrow I'll buy you a whole lot of detective stories.

Someone get a doctor.

I'll get some towels. 

He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.

Well, didn't you?

You did.

Say you're the one who got me in this!

Why, I believe the little woman cares.

I did find him!

That's a fact.

Hey... hey.  Don't do that.

I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.

I want to lie low till I get the whole dope.  I don't want to go off half-cocked.

I'm going to get the real murderer. I've got an idea.  Want to see me take him?

Got a nice evening dress?

Mimi...

I'm afraid you're lying, Mimi. You see, I really did see Wynant last night.

It's the only way it makes sense.

Yes, sir.  Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.

Police!

You shouldn't let that keep you from telling truth, Mimi.  Mrs. Jorgensen -  Were you ever divorced from Chris Jorgensen?

I'm going to give her a wedding present.  Thought I'd better do it now, before I forget it.  I can drop them on my way to...  That's funny....  Where are those bonds?

I'm fired.

This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.

You know so much about the Middle East, you know where we can get something to eat.

It's a fortune box.

I'm thinking about when this war is over. Why you figure I'm here?  'Cause I got tired of being president of GM?  If a brother doesn't play ball, or deal drugs there aren't too many big money prospects around, and I'm not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting the oil companies' wars. So I say if maybe there's something out there, what the hell, that's what I say.

Oh, God.

We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There is a war going on!

You just go when I say go.

Yeah.

What am I supposed to do?

All right.  I'll go up, then you send up the gold and--

You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.

Maybe I do.

Then get up and do something about it.

Why'd he come in our camp.

He's an enemy soldier.

Suppose I don't go for that?

That why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert.

If I give it to you, will you let us go?

OH MY GOD!

We disappear for awhile.  We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.

What are you going to do with your <u>third</u>?

Oh, that's fun.

It's the only way.  We drive!

Millionaires, man.

I didn't miss it.  I figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you'd want to turn back.

Faster we get there, faster we get back.

I heard it.

Me and Wes are just going to talk.

It's the treasure, that's what it is.

Stay low.

Is it dead?

Someone's got to send the gold up.  It can't get on the line by itself.

It stays as it is.  We're halfway home now.  Let's not blow it by people getting ideas.

We'll find our way.

Forget Wes.

What do you mean no?  They can fly us home.

I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me.  Not when we're so close.

Makes two of us.

No!

We've got to keep moving while there's still light.

They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell in the dark.

And then what?

I...I never killed anyone before.  I told you that.

We can't stay here.  Even if that wasn't an Iraqi soldier it's only a matter of time before some show up.  Get all the water you can carry, and we'll head out on foot.

Sun rises in the East.  We go the opposite direction.  May not find anything, but at least we'll know we're heading towards Saudi Arabia.

You come up with a better plan, let me know.

Me?  I say you don't have enough brains to be stupid.

No, but I figure now's a real good time to start.

Somebody has to.

Then I'm a rich man.

What?

How the hell should I know?

What?

Really?

Hey, Jaeger.  What's up.

People were suffering in Afganistan, and we didn't do anything.

It was an accident.  You saw it was an accident.

I thought it would be good to know.

I could.

What?

Come on, man.  I almost had this thing open.

You know what, Wes?  If you get a note from your mommy they might excuse you from the war.

Those soldiers have got loafers on.  What kind of army gives their soldiers loafers?

Yes!

Oh, no.

Those people down there are Shi'ites. You've got Shi'ites in the south of Iraq and Khurds in the North.  Neither of them've got much love for Saddam. Probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising, so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some.

I've got a new agenda now, it's get rich. The only way the Iraqis figure into that is not at all.

Yeah, we're down.

I think we found something.

He's a soldier.  He doesn't need a weapon.  He's got rocks.  He's got bare hands.

I'm not wasting my water on him.

You want to say some words?

Probably shot a few.  Scattered the rest. Murderers.

Correct.  Origin?

Correct.  Now secure a sinex drop reading.

No, evidently you reversed the polarity on his lobal travel. Secure another sinex drop.

What's the matter with you?

You've seen enough.

I have to see SEN.  I've just been given a shift change.

Now.

You don't have to... I don't trust him.  You ought to file a report.

I didn't.  You asked me about the card.  You're going to get us into trouble.

What?...Oh, no, THX.  That's not true.  Not satisfied?  THX, I need you so much.

But it's so hopeless...you're so beautiful.

I've got a slip movement to install on my next shift.  I'll never make it the way I am now.

We could leave, and live in the superstructure....

AH UGH.

What are you talking about? When did you sleep last?  Do you know what your trouble is? You're blind.  You've been here so long you can't see what is happening.  We must unite.  We need unity.  We need action. ) We have come to a time when we must....

We're leaving.

We're leaving.

THX and me.

No, look!  Three degrees from the central azimuth.

I want you for my roommate.

We had a long talk and she agreed that it would be a good idea for you to switch.  She felt that you had not been accurately mated to her in the first place... You're upsetting yourself.  Would you like something?

Look more closely.

You have to!....I'm 1138 THX Magnum manipulator 347 cell 94107 Precinct 3 Residence:  Level 6421 Complex 12 Ramp 5.  Roommate 3417 LU...H.

Must be an expressway.... You don't have to stay here, you know....

Where's LUH?

I thought of something.....

....going well.  How could I be so wrong.  SCO 1202 cross wired a 904.  He's been receiving extra credit.  He offered me some.

I did not accept any.  I...  I wanted... to.  But I didn't. You know I didn't.  Don't you?

You are a true believer.  Blessings of the state, blessings of the masses.  Thou art a subject of the divine.  Created in the image of man, by the masses, for the masses. Let us be thankful we have an occupation to fill.  Work hard; increase production; prevent accidents, and be happy.

You the Bomb Squad?

Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...

That cop who bought it... you didn't tell us he was your partner.

This isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery. You wanna work with us, you do it our way, understand?

Mike Reilly.

You mentioned something called Redstone.

Cream of the crop, huh? You?

`Til we get a better lead.

Well... it's more than we had ten minutes ago.

We've gotta be. In this business, you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments.

I don't know, it's strange... it's not the best career path, but when you get the bug, there's nothing you can do about it. See, when you beat one of these things... 

I don't know. There's an old saying, when in doubt, cut the yellow wire.

Where you guys at?

Would you?

Right.

He has a timer going as back-up, in case we got a hold of the remote.  Okay... first, run your fingers along the edges, feel for a sensor.

"Punks", huh?

We're a bit busy at the moment, I'll give you a statement in a few minutes if we're still alive.

Let's get something straight. We're doing you a favor. You're not exactly a guy we want around explosives.

Helluva fuck factor.

Unlikely. Probably, cash register or something.

Meg's lasagna. Good eats, Reilly. C'mon.

People are dying.

We're moving' on. I have to pick up the supplies. Just two little boxes.

Stay here.

You're vice, not homicide. Besides, you don't have the experience and you're too personally involved.

A ticking bomb...

We can't take the chance. Ring down to the Bomb Squad. I want them on alert.

Son-of-a-bitch... my nose... This fuck-up is interfering with-

Can it, Pluchinsky. And shove some cotton up your nose.

Scorch marks... looks like they used silly putty.

Shit. We're fucked.

Quiet!

It's about this.

IRA - instant retirement account.

You mean you just--? ... You keep a record of... matches?

I'll do it.

I thought I told you--

She's refused to say a word to anyone. What made you think you could get her to talk?

My God, you're going to use her, aren't you?

It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...

And it had diamonds in the back.

Diamonds all over.

In a moment.

erect in sweater, arms folded.

He bows, goes. Door shuts behind him.

That's just what I tried to tell him. Well, one word led to another. He really was a very charming fellow. So we talked for about ten minutes.

So I said to myself, "All right, if he wants to look at them, let him look at them. No harm in that." And then he said, "Say ah." And then I said, "Ah." And that's all I remember ... And when I woke up, I still had my tonsils, but my pocketbook was gone.

You see--  No, no! And <u>yet</u>--  <u>Did</u> I--did--now <u>where</u> could we have--

No.

Amsterdam?

But you <u>have</u> been in Venice?

Funny, the kind of men women fall for.

The type they marry.

Just dull.

Funny--the first time I saw him I thought he was a doctor!

Yes, Baron.

Yes, Baron.  Moon in champagne.

Yes, Baron?

Um-hum ...

Just a second.

For more than forty years. So Madame told me.

Um-hum!

No, not at all!

Are you insinuating that this is not an honest report?

I've got to see you.

Right now! It's very important, M'sieu Laval.

And you will be out by tomorrow morning.

Otherwise I'll call the police

What is it?

M'sieu Monescu!

The Marquis de la Tours. He was in the lobby. But I don't think he saw me. I'm positive he didn't. Thank heaven! ... But when I came up here, right out in the hall there was King Boris of Alconia!

Someone from another world--so entirely different. One gets so tired of one's own class--princes and counts and dukes and kings--ah! And everybody talking shop--always trying to sell jewelry ... And then I heard your name and found you were just one of us.

Ah!

<u>Grossartig</u>--<u>kolossal</u>!

<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.

That's what I'm here for--to get out! I want to get away from here, from you--as fast as I can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me.  Sixty-five, ninety-four--

Shut up! Don't make up any stories!

Lily!

The pleasure is mine, madame.

Oh!

No. What is it? Tell me.

This used to be my secretary's room.

And how I handle my <u>money</u>!

Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is wrong?

What are you going to do with my day tomorrow, M'sieu Laval?

I know all your tricks.

You're conceited--

Because I want to make it tough for you.

What would you say if you found your safe had been robbed?

<u>Adolph</u>?

And you expect me to believe that?

Goodbye.

But it could have been glorious.

Divine ... But that terrible policeman!

No, madame, it's the way you <u>follow</u>.

I know!

He is my secretary! I hope that answers all your questions, M'sieu Giron.

Yes, madame. You see, I have to get up very early.  My little brother goes to school--  You see, Mother is dead.

Yes, my bag!

The pumps --

An hour, two at most.

Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.

A hundred and one next month.

Lewis...

Rose Calvert.

We're running out of time. And this strutting martinet...  ...isn't letting any men in at all.

Then that's our play. But we're still going to need some insurance.  Come on.

There are still some boats forward. Stay with this one... Murdoch. He seems to be quite... practical.

There's no need for language, Mr. Hockley.  Go back and turn the heater on in my room, so it won't be too cold when we get back.

I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck.

Diamond. Yes it is. 56 carats.

I was tired.

I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.

I'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command! I am your fiancee --

I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch.

You see? Is my destinio!! Like I told you. I go to l'America!! To be a millionaire!!  Capito?? I go to America!!

If you don't shut that hole in yer face, there'll be one less in this boat!

We've struck ice.

Could I speak to you in private?

Jack.

Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.

Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.

They didn't teach you that in finishing school? Here, it's easy. Watch closely.

Just move with me. Don't think.

A mistake?

I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.

Sssshh. Come here.

Should I be expecting him anytime soon?

He's an ex-Pinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch, after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town...

To the stars.

It's okay. I'm alright.

This is crazy.

We have to tell Mother and Cal.

He couldn't have.

I know, I know.

We'll find out.

Just a few more minutes. It'll take them a while to get the boats organized...

That's enough.

We were pissin' in the wind the whole time.

Would you like anything?

Goodbye, mother.

I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.

How'd you ever get away with it?

I'm sorry, but you three men can play poker or something.  Shall I see you tomorrow?

I'll join you later.

We'll save you a place at our table.

Sorry I can't return the compliment.

<U>Gladly</U>.

Where's Lother?

Not at all.

That depends on how mother's feeling. You'll excuse me, gentlemen?

Sure!  Excuse me.

Want to take it back?

I wouldn't miss this boat for a million.

I'll say she is!

I could stand some more--

Good-by.

--sorry--got an appointment to play shuffle-board.

You're not very ambitious, are you?

Nothing to speak of. What is this--third degree?

You asked me to dine with you tonight.

For once I'm dead on the level--  --crazy about you!

Lonesome?

You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--

I'll give you plenty of rings as soon as I get the stones set--what do you think?

Lose?--I won a little--

You can live that down, can't you?

I'm beginning to think you're a pretty swell guy.

I thought you were a smart guy.

Oh, no--You're not gonna give my hard-earned money away.

Stop squawking! You were doing this job on a ship four years ago when I first picked you up, weren't you?

How're the tips?

Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.

I'll go with you--

No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--

Coming to the pool for a swim?

Now that that's settled, why not make the game a foursome?

Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.

What's that?

Sure.

That's right--here's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.

That's right. I owe you a dollar sixty.

June? That's my wife's name.

Sure.

So what?

I thought I put you to bed.

That's fine.

That's right--you're the one I was looking for.  You'll excuse me.   How about you and I being alone?

Let me see now--Don't tell me--  You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.

Looks to me like standard equipment for the Department of Street Cleaning--

Well, I'll tell you--we picked him up about a year ago-- but could never pin anything on him.

Yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see, Sally, I sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company.

Do what--

Very serious?

But I'm not finished yet----And your waves are so colossal--rocking boats both to and fro--Oh-h, Atlantic, how I love you ----how I love you--

Oh yeah?--My personality put this thing over--

All right--don't spoil the trip with any of those jokes-- there's a nice bunch of people on this trip--nothing but class--I looked over the passenger list and they're all members of the Who's Who!

Oh, all right--  See you later, Toots.

Good-night, folks.

Eh?... Oh.

It's a long trip and we'll get that sucker later.

You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.

It wasn't smart. Even if you'd gotten away without me --I'd have found you--no matter where you were.

Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?

Say, "Thanks very much!"

You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?

What!--are you crazy?

Telegrams.

Then why did you run away?

Does it hurt?  A lot?  Good.

Just this minute.  I'm Wyatt Earp, These're my brothers-

Fine, fine.  But I was thinkin', You know what this town really Needs is a race track.

My man?  You told Wyatt you'd Disarmed those men.  Do you Actually believe after that I Could see you as my man?  You're Just a dirty little fixer.

Where do you think?  I stole him.

He was quoting the bible, Revelations: "Behold a pale horse And the one that sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him."

Well... 'bye.

No...

Yeah, you look it.

Nothing.  Not a thing.  I'm right As the mail.

Perfect, Wyatt.  Simply perfect.

Didn't you always say gambling's An honest trade?

Well yeah.  Pretty much.  I mean I Was no angel when we met but People change Doc.  I mean sooner Or later you gotta grow up.

You will or you won't.  Don't look To me.  I'm going to sleep.

No...

A man like Ringo's got a great Empty hole right through the Middle of him and no matter what He does he can't ever fill it.  He Can't kill enough or steal enough Or inflict enough pain to ever Fill it.  And it drives him mad. Sick mad.  Cold and dirty.

What does he want?  He wants revenge.

Then what do I do?

I see, well this happens to be a Nocturne.

What?  But I saw 'em-

I'm your man...  You win again.  Well played, sir. You are on fire.

Wyatt, are you crazy?

He's right, Wyatt.  Ringo could Put five into you before you Could even get one into him.

Wyatt Earp, I know.  I was Beginning to think we'd never Meet.  This is fortuitous.  That Means lucky.

They know.  It's the scent.  We Better split 'em up.

The way you talk.  Never heard a Woman talk like that.

Fortuitous even.

Let me have one of those cigars.  Kinda nice in here.  You run it?

I don't know.  I'm all right.

Wyatt, what're you talkin' about?

Yeah, well, I swore a lot of things.

I need it.

Will you go to her and tell her Right in front of me she's Nothing to you?  Right out loud so I can hear?  Tell her she's Nothing, tell her she's nobody, Just dirt?  Will you do that?

You wanted to talk?

I'm not a lawman, I'm just a Private citizen getting' my Property back

But this time they'll be ready.

Hey!  Virgil!  My God!  Morgan!  Hey, Boy!  You look great!  Both of you!

Just his style, Morg.  Doesn't Mean anything.

Come on, we're not about pickin' Fights.  Just gonna keep a little Order, that's all.

Morg, use your head.

Yeah.  It's a fact.

Sure...

I know, I need a keeper.

Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys?

You are the one, Wyatt.  You sure are.

No, damn it, it's wrong, they're Breakin' the law.

Bundle up, Virge.  Cold out there.

Curly Bill, huh?  Who was that Other idiot?

No, I gotta do something.  I don't Suppose you'd card-

GET BOND OUT OF THERE.

I resent your tone, sir. I have men who are missing -

We'll see about that.

Sir Elliot.

I see.

I wonder if it runs in the family.

I can feel your pain.

So why did you leave?

And still not a thing to watch.

Good-bye, Mister Bond.

What about the gold?

Take the girl. Leave the handcuffs. We'll drown her at sea.

I know. Pirates from Sumatra want the cargo; smugglers from Thailand and Burma want the ships.

Did you test the auto-pilots? The satellite positioning receiver?

I appreciate your time -

That hardly makes up for the imposition.  Now, for what I hope will be the very last time - pay attention, 007.  First, computer generated retrograde analysis map. Body here, meteorolog- ical influences here, likely vector- ing of the ship's coordinates here.

Guard! Arrest these men! Escort them to the cutter!

Is this another one of your games?

Nothing.

Do you?

Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!

One thing at a time. I'll see you in twenty minutes. Go.

Occasionally, yes.  British media mogul. Born in Hong Kong; controls newspapers, TV, radio, cable, satellites; books, magazines, movies, computer software. Theme parks.

Fishing?

Tide and current charts. Work backward from the body - find where the ship sank.  Where did you get the boat?

Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.

Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur yacht club.

That's reassuring.

Interesting video tape.

No. But you can buy a drink for my friend, Taro.

Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.

Let's not make it a habit.

You have to excuse Miss Winch: She thinks she's on a 'seduce and destroy' mission through life...  ...But she won't kill us.

Think about mom.

- The family jewels?

That's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.

The only mistake is that they didn't kill us in the elevator.

Next time, I do the driving.

If you think we're going to have some kind of 'life affirming' romance here just because we cheated death, let me be clear:  We're going to have it where I want, and when I want.

Now.

Of course.  Minister Johnstone.

'Able to topple governments with a single story' - as he says in his press.

We serve the interests of the British people, 007. No matter who we may be foolish enough to elect.

Hopefully, it won't get that far.

Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.

Forget it. No way. I got here first.

Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney.

Yes -

Excellent.

Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.

...Haven't we already paid him for his services?

Who is it?

I don't know. He's not in the database -

Maybe. Maybe not.

Yes.

We will take her. You all stay here and watch Dad.

What is it, noontime?

What is a sip of coffee going to do?

He is just being like all parents, concerned about the ones they love.

You were in hell?

Do you think you won?

What for?

Have you lost your mind? Have you thought about your wife and child, not to mention your sick father? And I need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling.

Anytime you need someone to do something for you, just let me know.

No. Before anyone moves, you two shake hands and don't carry it any further.

You stay inside. I will see to them.

I need to get out there and get those weeds out.

He knows better. Sunny, apologize to Harry.

Why didn't you catch a plane?

Stay until you feel better? I would like to hear all the news.

Well if you're sure, I won't be a bother. Oh, I don't sleep on no spring mattress. I always make myself a pallet on the floor.

That's awful generous of you. I always ask to keep from wearing out welcome.

I was going to get up and get a hen out there for dinner, but time got away.

Course, it is your business, but I feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the boy.

Everyone has to follow his own plough. A man doesn't have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays. City people don't give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays. You don't plant old ways...  ... but, at the end, you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you.  It's when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they don't want it. You sell it to a stranger. You worked your whole life, for what?  I doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm. All what we've experienced has no meaning.

Where we come from, you had to know how to act right. You had to know how to say yes sir and no sir. You had to know your place.

Tolerable well.

As long as he keeps his throat clear, he is able to get some rest.

Hattie is a different person now.

Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.

Oh, I wasn't pointing my finger at you. Hey, you have to think of yourself. A lot of them have all kinds of diseases and will cut your throat while you sleep. There are too many bad people out there.

Speaking of tappy heads, we ought to have an old fashion fish fry.

You never know what's in the heart and just because you can cry doesn't make you human.

Junior's wife kept her afterbirth' in the refrigerator. That's why I do not eat over there now.

I haven't heard anyone mention Swamp Root since button-up shoes went out.

Everybody who have been associated with Harry end up with pennies over their eyes.

If it was left up to me, I would poison him.

Why not? Harry says that's the only way to do good.

You know the man next door is near death.

Tolerably well. I brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses.

I know you didn't but you have been so thoughtful.

I planted a row just for you and you don't owe me anything.

Well, sure, we can leave it up.

Sure!  I'll even let you drive.

Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're just not looking hard enough.

What?  What is it?

It's a long story, Bo.  I'll explain later.  Here, catch this!

I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?

Watch yourself!!

Alright, everyone.  You're clear to come up.

I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.

Uh-huh.  And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.

Oh, you idiot!  You're a toy!  Use your karate chop action!

Out the window...Buzz, you're a genius!

Yeah, right.

Woody!

Look out!!

Everyone, it's Woody!

So, you see?  We're friends now, guys.  Aren't we, Buzz?  You bet.  Gimme a hug.

Oh no, Hannah!

Look!  Janie!

She's sick!

A lunchbox...?!

Wait!  Wait!  I got a better idea! How about we DON'T?!

Hey, Woody!?  Where'd ya go?

I thought he was at summer camp!

Sir!  No Sir!

This is it!  This is it!  Quiet, quiet, quiet!

So did I tell ya?  Huh?  Nothing to worry about.

What?!

We're gonna get outta here, Buzz -- Buzz?

I did like the music.

A sin against <i>what?</i>

Speak when you're spoken to. He likes his women quiet.

It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside.

Get away from me...

You're not so old yourself!

He'll be looking for another apprentice.

So had I.

Well, I hope it stays that way.

He has debts.  He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.

Nine thousand dollars.

I want to believe you.  I really do.

I tried, Arnie.  And, I will continue to try.

Carl --

Drugs begin pouring out of America into every other country in the world. Canada is completely overwhelmed.

Does this mean you're going to be gone more?

The first thing we have to do is present a unified front.

Yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death.

Me, too.

She'll be at a pawn shop in an hour.

That makes mom the Czarina.  I'm a Czarette.  Like Anastasia.

Caroline --

Hi.

You can't make me.

He's gonna fucking die right here on the kitchen floor --

Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind --

Have you done your homework, honey?

We got you on tape making the deal. We got you bragging about the quality. We got you bragging about your business.  We got you.

I'm telling you, she doesn't know shit.

Winners don't do coke.  Or haven't you been reading the bumper stickers?

I don't know.

Not Tiger Woods.

Yeah!

When will you do it?

I am a legitimate business.  Fishing boats.  Tuna.  Check it out.  Tax records, everything --

I got greedy.  I decided to bring a little in on my own and somebody tipped you off.  That was my mistake. Carl would never be so stupid.

So go shower already.

Fine, then we don't have a deal.

It should be... It's yours.  I want our debt forgiven.  I want to be the exclusive distributor of Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the United States.  And I want the principle witness against my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.

That's crazy.  My husband is on trial for smuggling.

Deliver that safely to Tigrillo in San Diego.  And we have a deal.

They wouldn't do it in front of all these people.  They'd send someone later, when we're alone.

She's nosy.  She hears me on the telephone.

The police won't find your car.

Then I guess I'm going by myself.

Your new friends.

I'm aware of that.

It's possible.

If I ever return to the bench, Counselor Adler, I hope I have the pleasure of hearing your arguments.

She hasn't called you?

I don't know what to say.

You won't say anything to my parents?

We sometimes went downtown to score.

Yes, I am confident that Juan Obregon will be taken into custody before the end of the year.  But, you must understand that it is very difficult because of corruption in the police force.  We get a tip that he is one place, then we get there and he is already gone, having been warned by someone on our side.

What?  I thought Madrigal was dead. I thought it was verified.

It's three a.m.  I'm not supposed to be here.  I snuck out --

No. On you go.

The cards. The last thing I said to you was mind the cards.

It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.

It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.

Bit fucking late, like.

I'm off for a pish. When I come back, that money's still here, OK?

If everyone keeps their mouth shut, there'll be no one going to jail.

Did you bring the cards?

I'd fucking kill you.

Diane.

Eh-

think I left something back at the -

Ssshh!

And that's what's illegal. Do you know what they do to people like me inside? They'd cut my balls off and flush them down the fucking toilet.

Unless you get caught.

So why have you told me about it?

I've got a boyfriend, Mark.

What do you think -- I should be carrying a torch for you?

Indeed, yes, those halcyon days.

Oh, really?

Of course, the motto, the motto --

Exactly. Those very words have been my guiding light in what is, after all, a dark and often hostile world.

No, I'll wash them. I'll take them home and bring them back.

No.

And you might get the fucking job.

Eh - Ian Fleming?

Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up.

So who else?

OK, OK, so what's the point you're trying to make?

That's your theory?

What's wrong, Allison?

And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off.

You're a real mate. And what about Tommy? Have you been to see him yet?

I got a good price for it. Rents, I need the money.

Well, Christ, if I'd known you were going to get so humpty about it, I wouldn't have bothered. Are you going to eat that?

Well, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price.

It was just an idea.

About four kilos. So he tells me. Got drunk in a pub down by the docks last week, where he met two Russian sailors. They're fucking carrying the stuff. For sale there and then, like. So he wakes up the next morning, realizes what he's done and get very fucking nervous. Wants rid of this. {---------- He's looking for Swanney to punt it, but Swanney's nowhere to be seen since he lost his leg. ---------- }

We're two thousand short.

To see you through the night that lies ahead.

Your favourite dish.

And see when I get out of here. I've got plans. Going to get myself straightened out and head off to Thailand, where women really know how to treat a guy. See, out there you can live like a king if you've got white skin and a few crisp tenners in your pocket. No fucking problem.

Yeah.

Sure will, pal, sure will.

It will be. It'll make a change for three miserable junkies who don't know what they want to do with themselves since they stopped doing smack.

It's really nice, Tommy. Can we go home now?

This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?

Sulu! Look! The sun's come out! It's a miracle!

DO it. Go to Red Alert.

Then it's fortunate that I have you and your starship to protect me. In the meantime, Captain Chekov, I instruct you and your First Officer to beam down to my coordinates.

The same. From what we can make out, a terrorist force has captured the only settlement. And they've taken hostages.

I am preparing to toast a marsh melon.

I was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words.

Spock, we're on leave. You can call me Jim.

Go to sleep, Spock.

Goodnight, Bones.

Yes.

He reminds me of someone I knew in my youth.

What do you mean?

If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.

You ordered me to kill my brother.

Why didn't you tell me this before?

The designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find. He failed to escape.

It must be all those marsh melons.

If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.

James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise.

I'll take you to the bridge.

No conditions.

Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully...

Do you?

I cannot go with you.

I belong here.

Sybok, you are my brother, but you do not know me. I am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago. Since that time I have found myself and my place. I know who I am. And I cannot go with you.

"Embezzling" is such an ugly word, Mister Bailey...  No, actually I'm trying to get a legal brief together.

You haven't told him?

Nah...I decided...I've had enough of video games to last me a good long time. I feel like gettin' into some real life...

Something about tampering. Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget into his checking account, I don't know. Why are you so interested?

Flynn had access to you, too. I'm not interested in talking about him.

Okay, okay...

Hello, Alan.

For sure...

There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.

I'm sorry -

Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.

If you think -

Doing our business is what computers are for. Look, Walter, with all respect -- ICOM isn't the business you started in your garage anymore --

Oh, you want to -- hah. I could get myself de-rezzed just-for letting you in here. They hate this tower. They'd close it down if they dared to but they keep me around, in case one of them wants to deal with the other world once in a while. And you should hear the way they commune! Sounds like they were routing a payroll, for all the heart they put in it. No, I don't think you

No... Tron ... must... destroy MCP... first...

They may be... de-rezzed... on the carrier ... hurry...

The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?

You know anybody that's got an army for rent, that's fine...but my, uh, User said to go take that sucker out. An' let's face it, the big ox isn't gonna get any weaker. I feel like hittin' him now, while I'm good an' mad. Some nerve... what does he care whether you guys get killed, long as he keeps rakin' in quarters?

You wish. Man, I haven't had a second to think since I got down here. I mean in here. Out here. Whatever.

Look, you guys know how it is. You just keep doin' what it looks like you're supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and you hope to hell your User knows what's goin' on.

I hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the time, that's how it is for Users, too.

Probably decided not to pursue us, The Sea of Simulation is tricky.. lot of illusions...rough navigating. Programs have a way of just... disappearing here.

Yes.

Elementary physics... a beam of energy can always be diverted... ooh, my head  Are we there yet, Mommy?

Well, great, that's no sweat -- I play video games better than anybody.

Yeah, but I'm remembering all kinds of stuff. Like...my User wants me to go after the MCP

Come here.

Little more juice's all it needs...

Have you been sneaking into the ICOM system?

Boy, I bet I know who's workin' late tonight.

Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it...

Now get this straight, pal -- no one User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million of their man-years! I'm bigger than all those little wimps put together!  Humans they can't even keen their social order in one piece

I have to find out what Alan wants... that comes first.

That's all going to change, Yori...

As long as it gets us out of here

Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!

So I guess you didn't get away					* for the weekend after all?					*

Just an hour?  You should tell this stud to take more time.

Where are you off to young lady?

I'm not a pumpkin!  Okay?!!  Do I look even remotely like a pumpkin?! I'm not a muffin, or a cupcake or a honeybear either! And you don't understand anything Dad...

Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.

Yes.

What?

Albert Gibson.  Three four nine nine one.

In her dreams.

Nope.  The art buys are in a separate ledger.

Yeah, right.

Uh huh.  Want me to lose them?

And make it fast.  My horse is getting tired.

Goddammit!  That's outrageous.

That's it.  Get 'im Harry  We'll teach that little puke not to signal.

Son of a bitch!

Hardcore, highly fanatical, ultra-				* fundamentalist.  Linked to					* numerous car-bombings, that cafe				* bomb in Rome, and the 727 out of Lisbon last year.  Major player.				*

Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.

Put a tap on her phone.

Helen's phone.  Her office line and the line at my house.

What are you talking about?

Let's go.  I'll brief you in the air.

Sorry.

No!  Never!

That's right.  They want something...  dramatic.  I spoke to a number of people who said you're the one to see.

You're damaged goods, lady.

Fine, honey.  Stay asleep.

Yeah, it was wild.

I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks.

I'll just be a second.  So what happened tonight at the office?

Yeah.  It was a rush thing.  They needed some documents down at the court house.  I barely made it.

What did you need?

No.

You will be contacted with the assignment.

What?  Oh, the flat tire?  Yeah, I thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there.

You wouldn't believe me.

I don't know what this crazy bitch is on.  You should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business.

Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.

My God.  Have you had to...  have sex with other women in the line of duty?

Dance?

And you've got one.

Use 'em and lose 'em.

I always have a couple on the hook.  You know.  There's one right now, I've got her panting like a dog.  It's great.

Red hot.  Her thighs steam.

You son of a bitch.  Did you really think you could elude us forever, Carlos?

No.  Soon as I turn you'll shoot me.

No, my dear, he is a federal agent.  He killed two of my colleagues the other night.

I kept looking back, like you taught me.  I didn't see anyone.

I'm sorry, I can't.

I know.  But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things.

What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?

Ya looked through it?

Now hang up.

The oriental.

Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?

I took a cab.

Sure. Why not?

What do you do?

What's your favorite color?

I'm hip. But you know, I'm comfortable here. It's easy work. I know what I'm doing. Everybody who works here is my buddy. I'm friendly with most of the customers. I just hang around and talk about comic books all day.

I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.

You're not stupid. Just wrong.

Uh-huh.

I'm a call girl. There's a difference, ya know.  I don't know. Maybe there's not. That place you took me to last night, that comic book place.

Yeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.

Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty decent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with Arlene the other day.

Slapped her around a little. Punched her in the stomch. It was pretty scary.

Thank you.

Bottom of the ninth . Mr. Worley. Oh, by the by, Mr. Worley, have you seen your lovely wife today?

What?

No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good.

Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.

Really?

Cancoon.

It is what I want. But I don't want to spend the next ten years in jail. I don't want you guys to go to jail. We don't know what could be waiting for us up there. It'll probably be just what it's supposed to be. The only thing that's waiting for us is two hundred thousand dollars. I'm just looking at the downside.

I heard that.

Heard that.

Me thinketh he doth protest too much.

Can you live with it?

Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.

No thanks.

Has he gotten his mail today?

Yeah, they do. And maybe when I start being a successful actor I'll know those guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain't got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a little bit at a time -

Elliot Blitzer.

The zoo.  What are you waiting for?

What's to think about?

No shit? Dick, that's great!

In case they try to kill us. I don't know, what do you want me to say?

I know that Richard. I don't think I'll need it. But something this last week has taught me, it's better to have a gun and not to need it than to need a gun and not to have it.

No thanks, my stomach's a little upset. I ate somethin' at a restaurant that made me a little sick.

- that you're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars -

What department?

Do I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like French vanilla ice-cream?

Mr. Donowitz?  I told you, through Dick.  He's in my acting class.  About a year.  Yeah, he's good.  They grew up together.  Sure thing.

No.

No. No you're not.

Now that's bullshit, Lee. Every time you buy one of those little movies it's a risk. I'm not sellin' you something that's gonna play two weeks, six weeks, then go straight to cable. This is "Doctor Zhivago". This'll be packin' 'em in for a year and a half. Two years! That's two years you don't have to work with anybody's movie but mine.

I wanna be able to announce this deal at Cannes. If I had time for a courtship, Lee, I would. I'd take ya out, I'd hold your hand, I'd kiss you on the cheek at the door. But, I'm not in that position. I need to know if we're in bed together, or not. If you want my movie, Lee, you're just gonna have to come to terms with your Fear and Desire.

I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.

Anything stronger?  Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?

You don't know the chicken places around where you live?  Ask the guy at the place where a chicken place is.

She seems very nice.

What?

Well, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and Alabama. I like her. I think you make a cute couple.

Yeah, well, just stay outta trouble. Remeber, you got a wife to think about. Quit fuckin' around.  I love you son.

No.

I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they go?

What about him?

I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?

Step inside.

Sure. No problem.

I believe he believes him.

Or a supporting actor -

To front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.

We have to show in court that, without a doubt, a successful man, an important figure in the Hollywood community, is also dealing cocaine.

How the fuck could he know?

I'm tryin' to find my jacket.

Nigger, you lie like a big dog.

No.

No, I ain't been there. But I heard him say. Hollywood Holiday Inn. Kinda easy to remember.

Are you Dick Ritchie?

Where's that?

We have a very advanced program, something very different, requires very skilled people.

Uh, what?

You don't want to jeopardize that reduction, do you, Cole?  Have it taken away?

For a man in your position...an opportunity.

What's she doing?

No, 1995 is the past.

1989.  Six years for you.  There's the sign!  Right here!

What?

Ohhhh, that one!  Can we hear that one?

I did him a favor.  Now come on.

James, why don't we...?

Jeffrey Mason?

What's the matter with your leg?

You have to give yourself up, you know.

First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running.  Okay?

No, not really.  It's...it's in my mind.  Like you said.

I think I saw a TV show like that when I was a kid.  Where a boy...

...I had a dream about...something like that.

James...do you remember...six years ago...you had a phone number!  You tried to call and...

They got your message, Kathryn.  They played it for me.  It was a bad recording...distorted.  I didn't recognize your voice.

In a few weeks, it will have started or it won't.  If there are still baseball games and traffic jams, armed robberies and boring TV shows -- we'll be so happy, we'll be glad to turn ourselves in to the police.

On the walls -- they meant the animals when they said, "We did it."

Not, "what", babe!  When!

Cole!  Oh, God, Cole, where are we?

We'll get to the spider later, Mr. Cole.  Right now, we want to know everything that you saw.

Well, the guard woke me up.  He told me I volunteered.

Yes, sir.

Your psychiatrist?  Did you just say, "your psychiatrist"?

He's been tested for drugs?

I'll be right here...just in case.

I'm sorry, I didn't--

Or maybe you just think you do.  You can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, there you are.

Same back at you.

Hundred and eight already.

It is not.

Out of here.

I'll give you the money!  Okay? I'll give you two-fifty.  Just . . . just, please.

You Harlin?

Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.

Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?

Time.

Another accident?  You got to be more careful.

That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.

What?

You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.

Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.

What's it to you?

Yeah, give me the Miller.

I . . .

John . . .

He killed him, Sheriff!  I couldn't stop him!  He made me come with him. He told me if I said a word he would kill me too.

Don't tell him anything.  He can't do this.

Wrong number.

Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.

You didn't hear something?

There's someone in the house.

The wind isn't blowing.

What are you afraid of?  I'm the one's got the gun.  Stay here.

My name is John.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?

Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.

What happened to your hand?

You should be more careful.

I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some work there.

I couldn't stay in this place.  I wouldn't.  I'd just pick up, do whatever I had to do, and get out.

Did you like it; me watching you?

Come here.

I have ideas.

Still playing?

You know what I want.

No.

You need a meal ticket is what you mean.  Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.

Stop it.

Because I know you're full of shit.

Is that what changed your mind?  The money?

I'm not sure where it is.  Not exactly.  I never saw it.  I just heard him talk about it.

There has to be!

You're tense.  What are you all uptight about?

Now what?

But you said we could be together.

It's not locked.  I left it open when I took out Jake's body.

And you're not one to lie, are you?

What do you say, Jake?  Should we trust her?  No?  I didn't think so.

Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat.  Wants me to sail it for him.

You're talking like a mad man.

That was just loose talk.  I don't want anybody dead.

What makes you say that?

And what does that make you?

This morning I didn't know how badly I'd want to get out of this fucking town.

You're not buying a car, for Christ sake.  You're having your wife killed.  I'm the one who's neck is stuck out.  It's thirteen, or it's nothing.

Do we shake hands?

Is the job done?

You didn't kill her?

Thirteen-thousand dollars.  Had you done it.  Isn't that what we agreed on?

Darrell giving you problems?

Fifty dollars more.  That's a lot of money when you don't have a dime. And where'd you plan on getting the money from?  Maybe you thought you'd pay your friend Jake McKenna a visit.

You know what kind of woman Grace is.  You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Sierra.  What makes you think when you were planning on killing her she wasn't doing the same for you?  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who would have you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.

Two-hundred dollars . . . that's how I put a price on murder.

Accident, and yeah, I got to be more careful.

That country shit all sounds the same to me.

I've had time to get over it.

Oz.

You're too quick for me.

I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.

Get away from me!

Mister, I'm calling you out.

Oh, shit!

What the hell are you doing?  Are you crazy?

I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!

I'm gonna beat you so bad you gonna be eatin' nothing but soup the rest of your days.  Rain dogs is gonna be prettier than you when I'm done. I'm gonna mess you up so bad you gonna make your own momma sick.  I'm gonna . . .

You don't know the how, Mr. Vesci. And that's not the half of it.  I've got your money, and I go into this little grocery store to get something to eat and it gets robbed.

I had to beat it before the cops showed up.  I don't have a cent to my name.  I can't even get my car out of the garage.  I tell you, Mr. Vesci, if it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have any at all.  So, I was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so I could get my car.  I'll pay it back with the rest of the money.

Yeah.  What are you going to do? That Toby's a hot head.

I guess.

Sure, Sheriff.

Shut up!  The both of you.  Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy.  Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  You smell like trouble.  Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.

Christ no!

So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.

You afraid of the dark?

Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.

You got a lotta philosophy in you, old timer but you don't fool me for one second with all this blind man crap. One minute you lost your eyes in Vietnam, next it's the joint. Now it's a woman? I'm hep to you.

You know I won't be seeing you.

You expect me to believe that?

'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off, somebody gets hurt.

Oh, shit!

Who the hell are you?

I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.

Yeah, I know.  More careful.

An overheated car.

Would I what?

I do.

You're talking like a madman.

A man doesn't always mean the things he says.

You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.

No!

It's not what you think, Jake.

What are you talking about!

Don't Jake me boy! It's a big house. You probably didn't even make it out to the desert this afternoon...

How old are you?

Nope.  Darrell.

Yep.

'Cause Harlin used to own it.

Darrell--

Another accident?  You got to be more careful.

It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.

Listen, man.  I got rolled half an hour ago for everything I had.

You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers shut you down.

Darrell.

Yeah, like Al Capone on tax day. Get the keys?

Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.

Do you want me to carry your pack for you?

You're welcome, Grace.

Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .

I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.

What?

Walk away.

It's not like he's a young man, Bobby. He's had time to live. It'd be quick. I mean, he wouldn't even have to <u>feel</u> it...  I mean, sometime in the middle of the night, when it's quiet...when he's asleep, you could just come up behind him when he's pounding on me and...

There is no us, remember?

I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.  The only reason I stormed off is because you spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it.  It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here.  But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.

But we all need that too. Hold him.

Virgil!  Now look at what you done!  Are you all right?

Hell, no. That Wayne can't shoot when he's sober, much less drunk. He's lucky he didn't kill his own danged self.  Well, anyhow, you stay cool. Nice meeting you, son.

They look nice.

No! No! Please!

Shhhh! Just like your Mama, always scared of things...

No that's it.

Yes. Is this David?

My name is Megan Inverso. We went to college together.

Not often, but it is possible. Most people get scared when they see the shadow of their limits. They don't know how long the shadow really is. They don't know how far away the real limits are standing... They stop out of fear.

He's dealing with a lot of things.  I think he needs to find answers himself.

Yes.

Jeremy what the hell are you doing?

My turn. What's your favorite song?

What was that?

It's finished. I won.

Seventy-five percent.

Skeptical about what?

You assumed wrong.

Is there a problem?

But not a knife?

It's an exaggeration of the truth. Maybe it's based on something as simple as instinct. Like being able to touch someone and tell whether they've done something wrong... Or the level of what they've done wrong.

I never said you couldn't be killed. I never said that.

No. And I have been sick. I spent a week in a hospital when I was a boy recovering from pneumonia and almost drowning. Two skinny eight year old kids were playing around the pool. They were dunking me. I swallowed water. They didn't know it and they almost killed me.  Heroes don't get killed like that. Normal people do.

It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.

I mean if you knew karate?

That's great.

Elijah was wrong.

This kid is six foot two, two hundred and forty pounds. He runs the fifty in under six seconds. He's going to be a God.

Yes. Where are the rest of the passengers?

I own a comic book museum. It's called the Limited Edition.

Why?

I fined 'em instead.

On account of they seen you was beatin' on their friend.

We ain't got it. We ain't got no money.

Down the street and across. Greely's Beer Garden and Billiard parlor. Just ask for Alice and say you want a game of billiards.

Ha. He was building his fucking porch.

Little Bill? He didn't say nothing. Like I said, he was buildin' his porch. Have you seen that thing?

You ain't dead.

They went out scouting when they saw your fever broke.

Alice an' Silky gave them... free ones.

You want... a free one.

I admire that, you being true to your wife. I've seen a lot of... of men... who weren't.

You boys are off of the Spade Outfit. Got your own string of ponies?

Them whores, they been fuckin' an' fuckin' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks...

D-d-d-duke. The D-d-duke of Death.

Well, Mister Beauchamp, I was at the Blue Bottle Saloon in Wichita the night English Bob killed Corky Corcoran... an' I didn't see you there... nor no woman, nor no twogun shooters nor nothin' like that.

You... you mean...  English Bob killed him while...?

Did you... kill him?

Nobody didn't kill Ned, he went South yesterday. He didn't even kill nobody. Why would anybody kill Ned?

They got... a sign on him says he was a killer.

L-lies... at first. About how you was just passin' through and didn't kill nobody... an' Little Bill kept askin' questions, mixin' him up, catchin' lies... an' then he'd beat on Ned an' Ned would cry and lie some more an' then... then...

A cowboy come in sayin' you killed Quick Mike in the shit house at the Bar T...

Lemmee see that Schofield, Kid.

If he gets behind them rocks we ain't gonna get him... not without we go down there.

You missed him? You didn't...?

I can't see 'em.

H-hell yeah. I killed the hell out of him... three shots... he was takin' a sh-sh-shit an'... an'...

Two weeks, I guess.

Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle?

Well, it ain't just the bed I'm gonna miss. I'm...  Hell, Billy, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

Sally?

I didn't see nothin' planted.

Huh? Uh... yeah.

Jesus, Bill, you got fever. Take a drink, will you?

Ned... Is that you, Ned?  Ned, I seen... death.

I seen the angel of death Ned, an' I seen the river.  He's a snake, he got... snake eyes.

Supposin' he don't go to the ranch?

Best we move that pig.

Three? That ain't bad considerin'.

The Kid, yeah...

Tom? Only how... how if you didn't... didn't come back in a week...  how we was to take half the money to Sally an' say you was...

Did I what?

Thought you was followin' me.

Oh, them.  Hell, I seen them.

I don't like the question.

All of it. About him, an' you an' Uncle Pete... about robbin' the Rock Island Pacific... an' about them Missouri Banks.

We'll bury him.

Yeah?

I've been looking all over for you. You still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor?

And ?

A glass of water would be nice.

Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet .

This whole thing was a shakedown.

Then who goes?

The way I hear it, Soze is some kind of butcher. No pity.

Did you hear what he just said?

County. I was in for fraud.

If you'll just let me -

You okay?

Maybe more.

Something - I don't know.  I ever tell you about the restaurant I wanted to open?

Who's Keyser Soze?

Just do what I tell you.

What time is it?

Mr. Redfoot knew nothing. Mr. Soze rarely                 t works with the same people for very long, and they never know who they're working for. One cannot be betrayed if one has no people.

Mr. Soze will be most -

I shivved him.

Who is he?

We want to meet him.

What'the fuck is that?

If it was a dope deal, where's the dope, if it was a hit, who called it in?

You know damn well what I think.

I don't think he does. Not exactly, but there's a lot more to his story. I want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there. Above all, I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead.

Kobayashi.

Sure. And I appreciate that. And I want to help you, Agent Kujan. I like cops. I would have liked to have been a Fed myself but my C.P. was -

I know he was good.

Keaton was a piece of shit.

I'11 be sure to mention that to him.

You wanted to know what happened after the line-up, I'm telling you.

Do I? Keaton was under indictment a total                 + of seven times when he was on the force.                  + In every case, witnesses either reversed                  + their testimony to the grand jury or died                 + before they could testify. When they                      t finally did nail him for fraud, he spent                  + five years in Sing Sing. He killed three prisoners inside - one with a knife in the tailbone while he strangled him to death. Of course I can't prove this but I can't prove the best part either.

The D.A. gave me immunity.

Turn state's evidence. Take the stand on this and we'll hear it out.

If there is a Keyser Soze he'll be looking for you.

Can we just get back to Kobayashi?

McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.

I don't

But how - wait. You're saying SOZE sent                  t us to kill someone?

Why lie about everything else, then?

You think he's..?

I'm not bait. No way. I post today.

Abrams...

The man's an ambulance chaser ...

No.  Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.

You thought it was just.

Yes.  It would be.

Gruber...

Frank Galvin's ... who's calling please?  Bishop Brophy's office ...

Yes.

When she...

Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?

Yes!

I'm on the staff of...

Objection.

You may step down.

...one moment, Mr. Concannon...

I...

You've just said you signed it.

You didn't write that figure.  And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?

After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in.  He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.    And he told me to change the form.  He told me to change the one to a nine.   Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me.  He said I'd never work again....Who were these men...? Who were these men...?  I wanted to be  a nurse...

It's completely done on a contingency basis.  That means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third ...that is, of course, the usual arrangement ...

You ruined my life, Mister...Me and my wife...and I am going to ruin yours...  You don't have to go out there to see that girl.  We been going four years.    Four years...my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.

What you thought!?  What you thought...I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...

Is that what a good doctor would do?  How old are you, please?

Actually, yes.  It's by no means bad, I...

From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...

She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.

Whose side are you arguing ...?  I thought that you wanted to do something.  I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going  to ... I have an interest in the Hospital;  and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid.  You caught 'em.  Now: how many others did they kill?

What are they going to do?  Not invite me to their Birthday party ...?   Look, I gotta go.  I have to be in Cambridge ...

...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?

I've got nothing to say to you.

Well, maybe you better do that, then.   You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores.  You'd do anything for a dollar.  You got no loyalty...no nothing...you're a bunch of whores.

Thank you for seeing me.

I don't have a week.  This case never should have come to trial. You know better.  You're Mr. Independent.  You want to be independent?  Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.

Ready, your Honor.

If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...

And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.'  'Cause I know who you were.  You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are.  I know who you are.

Damn right I'm done.  I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.

Let me talk to Mickey.

How come you're calling me from...?

Kathy Price.

Missus...

I changed my room at the Hotel.

The TV didn't work.

Maybe what?

Do you want me to go...?

You're going to stay here...?

Isn't there something you...

You're talking like a drunk.

And what makes you so tough?

No...no...

Dr. Gruber's not in.

Dr. Halpern's taking all his...

... You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them ...

What do you want?

...Gruber's not bad.GALVIN Not bad...?  This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick...  And you calm down, all right?  Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse...'All these guys are God.  I saw them walk on water...'

Right.

You got a good memory, Franky.

So what...?  The best is yet to come.  Check the TV Guide.  They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'

D'you find the obstetric nurse?

Yeah.  I'm awake.

The Doctors.

Read me what she said.

What did she do?

... we, we love her, Dick and me ...

... You saw her?

My doctor told me that I got to move out West ... that's when we filed in court.  We didn't want to sue ...

Yes.

She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.

...everybody.  Mike says, `Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?'  `That's correct.'  Mike says, `Pat.  Have you been in this bar ?'  Pat says, `No, but my sister has ...'   Everyone.  Buy yourself one too.

Thanks, Franky.

Yes.

We, we were rather busy...

How'm I doing so far?

Me, too.

No, it sounds idiotic, I know. And you're still the hard-headed Scot, aren't you? Always were. Do you think I'm making it up?

There are things you didn't tell me.

Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.

And when she goes to those places...

Scottie, what happened? She's not home, yet.

What about?

You're not far wrong.

Who you are --

I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.

Yes.

But Scottie, you don't have to!

Judy, I just want you to look nice. And I know what kind of suit would look well on you.

Judy --

No, I don't want any clothes! I don't want anything! I want to get out of here!

I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that's dead. And not even that, very much.

Ah, no!

Wherever you'd like...

Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!

So am I, But it has to be done. I have to tell you about Madeleine, now.

Scottie --

You can't. You're afraid!

Why? Since you'd tricked me so well up to then?!! You played his wife so well, Judy! He made you over, didn't he? Just as I've done. But better! Not just the hair and the clothes! the look! the manner! the words! Those beautiful phony trances! That jump into the Bay! I'll bet you're really a strong swimmer, aren't you! Aren't you!!

Your accident...

I don't know... Switzerland?

No...

You've nothing to apologize for.

Of course not! I'm a wanderer!  I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!

If I've been there? That's silly! Either you've been to a place or you haven't.

Knowing I have to die...

Only silence. It's always like this.

Here with you.

Yes...

Long ago...

A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...

But I'm the woman in the mirror!

And so explain it away?  But there is a way to explain it, you see. If I'm mad? That would explain it, wouldn't it?

Why? What's happened?

I didn't wake him. I don't want him to know...

No, never!

And it's a all real.

I love you too... too late... too late...

When she comes down, don't say that I've been here.

Would you please go and look?

What car?

It wasn't your fault.

It's where you belong.

I'm having one now.

I've never run across one like that.

You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.

Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd would. No.

I asked my doctor. He said only another emotional shock could do it, and probably wouldn't. And you're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out.

Not that kind of history. The small stuff! About people you never heard of!

All right, come on. Introduce me. Where is your hat?

I'll take you home.

And the idea is that the Beautiful Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead, to take possession of Elster's wife?  Ah, Johnny! Come on!

Mmm, yeah, I guess...

Oh... this and that.

What is it, a still life?

But you said grey, sir.

Can we have it by tonight?

Yes, it is. Now, I want to look at an evening dress, a dinner dress, black -- short -- long sleeves -- with a neck cut this...  ...and the skirt out. 

We're gonna get caught. I know we're gonna get caught. They were eyeballing my car.

What?

What did you say?

First of all...

Because my opinion threatens yours, it's poorly developed?

Boyd brought up divorce statistics.

Why was the floor wet?

They're not on to us. I'm gonna call Boyd.

You're a loser.

You go home!

You can't keep bringing up Starbucks. That was your only real hit in like 75 tries.

What?

I'm calling the ambulance.

Calling the ambulance.

We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.

We can do this. We can get her out of here.

Nobody knows she's here. I called her personally. Nobody knows.

I'm not wrecking the transmission!

No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them.

That is absolutely not true.

Lighten up Adam. Show some character.

At the seven-eleven.

Adam! Calm down.

It has worked.

No...we want padded chairs...okay?

No. I think it's fucked.

I know and I'm honored...

What happened? Oh my God...

Don't sweet lip me.

Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing...

I'm with Tina. Is she there?

She's still working?

Sweet deal.

What is her disposition?

No.

Shut up.

Well we can definitely call the police. That's an easy call. If we call the police...What happens?  They find a dead prostitute in the bathroom...They ask us...What happened? We say, ah...our friend, Micheal...  Your brother...got a little out of control...they were making love...and he got a little excited...and he, ah, sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet, while he choked her to death with a rubber hose...

I think we should say some words over the grave.

No easy Boyd! I got a best friend in there in pieces. How about a little sensitivity?

What is the question you asked me?

Say it again.

Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police?

Suck my ass.

Yeah.

Now?

You're sick.

Not a prayer.

The hell you didn't!

You hate women.

True.

Israel doesn't have a King.

Not really, no.

You will not screw this up.

We're not goosed.

Goosed!

Government cutbacks.

I don't think so.

Sent it.

Sent it.

How could I know what else I forgot?

Right before the wedding?

David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.

Who else?

You're going to be hungover for three days. Like those guys on "Oprah" that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them.

I'm not. What's the problem?

What kind of seats can we have?

Go down where?

Hi.

We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late.

After the wedding, which we're paying for ourselves, and this house...

We're not canceling.

No.

Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident.

Micheal, by accident.

She's not alone...She's...Boyd...Oh God...He's gone nuts...He killed Lois and Micheal...it's all...

Move the bodies.

You did all right dad.

Harry Chaplin. "Cats in the Cradle."

Yeah, Dad. It's great.

I just want her to be happy.

Go for it.

At the newsstand on 3rd.

I got to agree with that.

Downstairs in the closet.

That's right, "Pup Corn." Doggie treats. Little snacks for dogs. He's figured it out. There is a hole in the market and he's going to fill it. Spends all our money, works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up. After fifteen months, the big day arrives, the first box of "Pup Corn" pops off the belt. He comes running home with that box, pulls us out of school. We all pile into the living room, must be fifty of us, and in comes "Shelmer," our 8 year old mutt. "Here Shelmer," my dad cries. He's got that little fucking pup corn in his hand, "Here girl." This dog will eat anything, she eats rocks, anything. She walk's up to my dad's hand, looks down at the little pellet, licks it once, turns around, walks out of the room. Shelmer rejected the "Pup Corn." Fifteen months of my dad's life, right there. Not one dog ate Pup Corn. Not one. Three months later, "Pup Corn" shuts down. Chapter Eleven. My father never got over it. Never.

Where?

Yup.

I kind of like "till death do us part." I mean, this is forever. In sickness and in health, through good times and bad. Honey, what do you think?

The stone age.

A mutant species.

No, the children sleep with me.

Yes, yes.

Let me go, Don Amalio, I'll tear her apart.

So you didn't come from the poorhouse!

Really, Don AMALIO, there's not much point in making a fuss.

A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.

In twenty years the grass has invaded everything. There are spiders all over the house except on the first floor. I hardly ever go out.

Come down.

I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.

You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.

And this innocent child.

No, Uncle, and now I'm pleased to have been able to do this favor, because, although I didn't think so at first, you are really a good man.

You must be out of your mind. I've been so happy these last few days -- now you've spoiled it all.

I'd be really ungrateful, if I didn't like you, sir; you took me and my little girl in when I didn't know where to turn.

Quiet, my dove. Quiet, or I'll ...

Run and get something to mop it up with, quickly.

I think I'd better go tomorrow.

That's life. Some people are brought together, others are separated. What can we do, if that's the way it happens?

There's plenty of money in this house. Piles of it.

Where's the dough?

These chairs are in good condition. With a little varnish and some new covers this one will be quite presentable.

That's stupid! Plaster! It can still be used.

Are you Jorge?

I'll be ready.

How much do you want for him?

What's he called?

I'm afraid.

He couldn't get through the door, then?

They shut all right now. And the blankets are ready.

Yes!

In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him.

He has paid for your studies and your maintenance, and he has just sent your dowry. Does that mean so little to you, Viridiana?

I had so many things to think about!

I have nothing to reproach myself for. All I know is that I've changed. With all my strength, which is not much, I will follow the road that the Lord has shown me. One can also serve outside a convent.

Oh, you slept well; don't worry.

Hello.

You mean a nanotech synthetic organism.

You already have staked your reputation.  Mayor Bennett and I have been friends a long time. Since Grimes tried to kill him, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that Sid 6.7 might go after him, too.  Bennett's Re-Election Rally is tomorrow night and we already have enough trouble on our hands with one psychotic on the loose.  The fail-safe online, yet?

Why'd.. .you pull me out?

What about them?

What she's going to do is get in my way.

Their weapons missing?

Where's my gun?

You're going to put your theories to practice. I'm sending you into the field.

The man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives. He lost control and is capable of doing it again.

Not from in here.

Sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area. Whatever the device is, he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates.  Have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena.

You're the highest law enforcement official in the country. Use the fucking army if you need to.

Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember?

I was assured the problem was corrected.

Neither will the public.  The media has caught wind of his pardon. Unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results, I'm going to put him back in his cage.

You're...such a wimp.

What's wrong with Parker?

Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?

Think hard -- it'll come to you...

I had something a little different in mind.  Instead of just playing Peeping Tom with Reilly, why don't you get him to show you what he's been working on after hours?

In other words, par for the course.  How do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday?

That's not true, Parker.

He had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight. Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17. All he did day and night was play the violin.

Checking my pulse. It's elevated.  You enjoy frightening me, don't you?

Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one...

In order to find him, we have to understand what makes him tick...

Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.

What I do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before.

You like baseball?

Both.

No! Grimes isn't back. He's only one part of Sid. Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than Grimes ever was.  Get a hold of yourself!

Thanks.

A bomb's going off tomorrow night, but I have no idea where.

I thought you liked me being in the audience. Don't you want me to see it?

Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow.

<u>Lure</u> him. 

...and he's got a <u>negative</u> rating of... 

I need a little bit of <u>help</u>...?

What'd ya think?

Wilfred, that's not bad.

...twelve years.

He's not fine.

Come on.

But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?

When it broke, he said one word:  get me Ronnie Brean.

Okay.  And she's alleging...?

Well, yeah.  Now.  That's not good.  <u>Okay</u>:  <u>Okay</u>.  We'll set up the War Room <u>Here</u>...

Yes -- It will... Now:  why is the President in China?

One day, Two days?  <u>Course</u> it's gonna hhhh....

What in the <u>world</u> would do that?

I'll be back within the hour.  Now,

...you want us to go to War with Albania.

The Hostages...?

...I just hope...

... they're checking the ratings...uh...

Knock on wood.

Due in Nashville.

What are we gonna <u>do</u> about it...?

...what are we going to do...?

Well, what do you want to do about it?  What do you...

Could we have you in here, please...7

Guess what?  We show, and N.S.A. confirms, there <u>are</u> no nuclear devices on the Canadian border.  There are no nuclear devices in Albania.  Z'at put us in something of a pickle?  Albania <u>has</u> no nuclear capacity.  Our spy satellites show "no secret terrorist camps" in The Albanian Hinterland.  The F.B.I. and the Border Patrol, And the R.C.M.P. report no repeat no untoward activity along our picturesque Canadian Border.  The Albanian Government is screaming its innocence, the world is listening.  There is no War.

Any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh...

You gonna git me back tomorrow?  Cause they havin <u>beans</u> tomorrow...

...we will <u>not</u> be swayed, will, will not be <u>swayed</u> from <u>Every</u> effort to find <u>our</u> Old Shoe, our...

How's our friend?  What is he, "dead?"

BREAN, SHAKING HIS HEAD.  IN THE B.G., MOSS, DRINKING. THE TV COMES TO LIFE.

Yeah, I need a list, people in Military Special Pro...

Heavy weather East of here.

Six to five and pick'em...you wanna <u>chance</u> it...

N'who might <u>you</u> be, when all's said and done?

Who're you working for?

I have a question for you.

Earn your money.  ...He's ill, the Plane is sick...

Alright, now, here:  he stays on the ground in China til Tomorrow.

And, to hold it together, I need two days.  There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber:  here's what you do ahout that:  whoever is leaking stuff to that geek at the Post, lets it slip, "Geez, I hope this doesn't screw up the B-2 Program..." "What B-2 Program, and why should it screw it up?"  "If the president moves to deploy the B-2 before it is fully tested."  "Deploy the B-2, <u>Why</u>?"  "In the Crisis."

...holding action.  THEY'RE GOING TO TEAR THIS GUY TO <u>Shreds</u>.

Yeah, hut you can't hold the dam.  How the hell, n'nu'n', I don't get what you want <u>me</u> to ...

Why Albania?

Is that true?

And <u>if</u> you never won an Oscar, How'd you like an ambassadorship... 

Ten Days.  There going to be any Back End in this thing?

...there gonna be any money in this thing?

In the Folk Music Section.  We'll be in in...

Some, military... Special Program, Oklahoma somewhere...

What do you mean he won't do it?  He won't do <u>what</u>?  He won't do the sp...  It's what?  It's <u>corny</u>?  <u>Corny</u>?  Is that the word?  Of <u>course</u> it's corny.  We wouldn't have him <u>say</u> the flippin' thing it wasn't corny.  Put... listen, it's not a question, we're locked <u>in</u> to this speech.  NO We're, Are You Listening?  LOCKED IN.  We're, we're playing way <u>past</u> it, we're <u>past</u> it -- it's the set-up for...he has <u>got</u> to say the speech.  Tell Ames to meet me at the West Gate in... 

Hey, lemme close out the thing in style.

Guy says he'll respect her tomorrow, he <u>might</u>, but why take a chance?  Hold out til after you're married. That's... that's.... looky, we're offering'em Schumann, make em <u>vote</u> for hhhh.... psychologically, they will understand that that's the bargain.  Make them pay for him.  Make... that's right, the price is their vote. Now, we bring him home, the President announces he is flying <u>home</u>, he's <u>here</u>, he's <u>there</u>... f'there the election, TA DA, here he is.  Have him say it like I wrote it, It'll be fine. Thanks.  Labor, five bucks an hour.  If you <u>watch</u>, <u>ten</u> bucks an hour.  If you <u>help</u> ... if you <u>help</u>, a <u>hundred</u> bucks an hour.

What am <u>I</u> gonna do?  I'm gonna "Fade Away."  What are you gonna do?

Of what?

Yes, William, Uh, we have this <u>thing</u> we're doing...

It's an anti-psychotic, the num...  the number...hello...hello...

We'll deal with that when we come to it.  <u>This</u> is producing.  <u>This</u> is what they pay off on...come on, Pal, Boots and Saddles...

Ha ha.  No, no, not <u>now</u>, not <u>now</u>, of course, But Someday... when they tell <u>this</u> story...

He raped a <u>Nun</u>...

He's doped to the <u>Gills</u> ...

...but...

They'll be here in ten minutes.

That's <u>one</u> thing, but I'm not gonna let two dickheads from <u>Filmschool</u> take it... are you <u>Nuts</u>?  Are you <u>Nuts</u>?

Keep Talking....

Where are we on the Image?  Grace?  <u>Grace</u>...

It can't be a ribbon cause AIDS had a ribbon, cause the Yellow Ribbon thing had a ribbon, cause...

The special hats of the Special Anti-terrorist detachment of the Border Patrol.

...the pet wrangler suggested it..he's also got a...

John Belushi... <u>Jim</u> Belushi...

Yeah, good good good good good.  And They're <u>So</u> <u>Secret</u>...

By the  media, by, yes, by, in this case, our organization.

...they... <u>you</u> know...

No, no, no.... we'll punch <u>in</u> a kitten.  Um... <u>Later</u>.

Yes. 

How 'bout a Cold Drink...?

SUSIE...?  Are you alright...?

Sell it all.  What the hell, so I'll only make ten million.

Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!

Coulda been a contender.

Dad, it takes time. You gotta build a customer list. I'm doing it. I could make more money in one year as a broker than five years at the airline.

50 K don't get you to first base in the Big Apple, Dad, not any more. I pay 40% in taxes, I got a rent of 15,000, I got school loans, car loans, food, park my car costs me 3 bills a month, I need good suits, that's $500 a pop, shoes...

Sure I'm sure. Buddy, you got that mischievous look in your eyes. You used to smile just like that when you were a baby sleeping, just like that.

Dividend. I figure I owe you about five thousand in nickels and dimes...

Yeah, don't want to be late for my own funeral.

Maybe that's the price, Bud, maybe so. It's gonna be rough on you but maybe in some screwed up way, that's the best thing that can happen to you...stop trading for the quick buck and go produce something with your life, create, don't live off the buying and selling of others...

First of all, Mr. Fox, you can't just come barging in here. And what makes you think it's his birthday?

No, no Dixon, my client wants to buy a large, large block of stock and needs to spread it around. I'll park some money in your account and if it hits, you get a big cut. I'm telling you, this is the easiest money you ever made...

Look Dixon, calm down! It's not illegal to buy stock or to be right. And it's not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy. Tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment.

Yes! Read the Constitution, it's all in there. And remember--you don't know anything, nothing.

Let's see, it closed at uh, 41 1/8...  Up a quarter...very attractive... about average yield...

Nah, she asked the wrong question.

What about you, I hear you guys are handling the Fairchild Foods merger and it may not be going through. Any surprises I haven't read about in the Wall Street Journal?

I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you...

There was a crash last year. They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't know.

Bluestar was at 21 and an eighth when I left the office. It might spin up to 25 by the bell...

I don't understand.

...we have 37.2 million invested. At this point, we're up 3.1 million and some change. If it goes to 75 bucks we can clean close to 12 mill.

"All warfare is based on deception..." Sun Tzu says, If your enemy is superior, evade him, if angry, irritate him, if equally matched, fight... if not, split and reevaluate.

I think I got some friends that won't mind making some easy money...

Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?

Obviously...

Dump it.

Aha. Poet or philosopher?

You could have a great beach house for that.

Upper West Side.

Yeah, almost...

I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're still young, Darien. So what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise.

You're so naive Bud, you don't even know. Your dad took care of you. I might've been rich when I was a kid...but my father lost all his money...in the seventies, in the stock market, at the track. He was a lousy gambler...

So did I, till I hit 19 and found I had all the royal habits and no throne. Mom got by but I had to go to work just like you. Only the skills I had were shopping and making friends. So...that's why I do what I do, what makes you tick, Buddy?

Jesus, can't make a buck in this market, country's going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch Roosevelt was around... too much cheap money sloshing around the world. The biggest mistake we ever made was letting Nixon get off the gold standard. Putney Drug--you boys might want to have a look at it.

No, it's a prophecy. The rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time. The only difference between the Pyramids and the Empire State Building is that the Egyptians didn't have unions.  I know what this guy is about-- greed--he's in and out for the buck and he don't take prisoners. He don't give a damn about Northstar or us ...

...that "scum" built this company up from one plane in thirty years, they made something out of nothing, and if that's a scum I'll take one over a rat any day...

Now tell me, why would I want to do that?

Come on, we both like Buddy. But this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top... It doesn't fit.

Hey, the Terminator! Blow 'em away Ollie.

Rip their throats out and put them in your garbage compactor.  Interesting. You got a card?

No. This time I'm in for the long term. This is not a liquidation, Gordon. I'm going to turn it around. You're getting a free ride on my tail, mate, and with the dollars you're costing me to buy back the stock, I could modernize the plant. I'm not the only one who pays here Gordon. We're talking about lives and jobs; three and four generations of steel workers...

Done. You'll hear from my lawyers. 8 a.m. Good night.

I'll have a letter of agreement drawn up within two days.

If you mean what you say, I think we're in the ball park. I'll take it to my people.

You guys must know something nobody else knows. If those are my plans, it's the first I've heard of it.

We'll take our chances.  Nice to see you again, Mr. Gekko.

So why are you dating Jonathan?

Ok toots, I will.

It's all rather morbid though isn't it?

Uh, not today Jenkins, I need the fresh air

A party at a waxwork huh?

Uh yes, thank you.  It was quite enjoyable.

Forget her Mark, she's a bitch

Must be what we came for. The four stand slowly and enter through the doors, which close behind them.  They begin walking around  the WAXWORKS, which appear gruesome. The first they spy is of a high school student with a letter  jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman.  They give each other looks of  disgust and continue on.  The next is of a Frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms.  The  four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually, with TONY encountering what appears to be  a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim.  MARK walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside, and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it.  On the  staircase is a zombie-fied creature.  We see CHINA walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man  pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth.  Finally, we see TONY walking up to a cottage room display.

So Mark, what's so urgent?

Well divide 18 into three

Sell my soul?

You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.

Mom.

They're all human beings

You guys are being real assholes

I'll come back all the time.

A ghost?

Someone crying.  A girl.  I thought I was crazy.

You're joking.

Mm-hmm.

Do you have any idea who she is?

Fine.

Try to communicate with her somehow.

Yes, but...

I don't know, I'm very confused right now.

Almost.

Who's that?

I'm not...

I can't, no, no, I can't...

And then you weren't there.

Of what?  What were you so afraid of?

Please leave me alone.

I should be going anyway.

Biology.  She wanted to be a doctor.

This is...

I came in from my room...

I don't know.  When you say it, it sounds crazy.  But what else could it all be?

Jody, no...

Shhh.

I think so

I was down in Adamant...

I think three...

Don't.

Nice.  Almost done.

Not the focus.

Yup.

Shhh.

Mmm.

I'd never be able to live with mysel--

Is it gone?

I'm stuck here for another couple of hours.

There were some noises.  I didn't want to disturb you.

Well, that's nice.

What?  No.  No.

No.  Look!  In the window.

It's her!  I'm telling you.  She whispered and turned on the music.  She's trying to contact me!

Who did?  Mrs. Feur?

Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.

...Don't get all...

What can it hurt to talk to someone?

No!  And I don't need a psychiatrist!

He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--

Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman, she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to leave.

Sweetheart--

No, it's fine.  I'm fine.

Yep.

But why?  I can't understand how I could just completely--

What's wrong with me?

Not personally.

STOP IT!

What's the matter?

Who?

Who?

...would do anything just to be around me.  And I slipped.  God help me, I slipped.

You should have tried harder.

Incredible.  We should take a drive before they're gone.  Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.

Huh.

You don't have to do that.

:No, I said, I hate what I'm doing to Darcy. Oh, boy, men are stupider, it's true.

Michael - you loved that house as a child.  You could work again! You could make it ours. We'll sweep out the horror.  And Lasher with it!

Two what...?

But why would they do that...?

But it doesn't make sense.  They - they used Lasher...  they conspired with him.

Every day  twice.

What are you talk---

It's over a month.    The police say it happens all the time.

In certain cases, hell is the operative word.

Diedre Mayfair was your mother.

Yes.    Listen carefully, Rowan. Have your attorney contact me at once. There are matters of immediate -

I under5tand.  All the same

I want to see my mother.  Where is she...?

Better than most, I suppose.

Why are you doing this...?  Handing out these horrors! Why...?!!

'He'...?

Always loved you..

It is from love.

It's too soon to know.

What Michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand.

I LOVE him!

Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it is done. Only me...

How is your heart, Father...? Is the Timex still ticking...?

I know.    you are my son -

I guess so.  The trick is remembering how to act like one.  I'm glad you called, Mr. Curry. I wanted to see you.  Why don't we go to my office...

Nothing.  Absolutely nothing-

You knelt there, helpless-  You couldn't save him.   There was so such anger in you-.   Death infuriates you...

Really...?  Your family there...?

Is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is...?



Listen.  Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...

Wait a minute.  Rowan - what is going on...?

Let's see.

Hello..

Than letts get rnarried, Michael.  I could put a spell on you - and make you say yes.

Mm-hmm...

Mm-hmm...

That's not funny.

- we made a fire.

A little sore.  Darm...   Finish up my section, will ya...?

Gotcha.

I just - hate it when they're - finished.

That's a wasp.  Fuckers'll sting a tree if they're bored-  so - where is she...?

Hey - I love gloves-  I look really great in gloves.

Papers...?

I plan on liquidating almost evetything.

I'm sorry - I didn't think

Don't mention it - now can I get back to my accounts, or do you want to fillet me?

Well, if you could come sometime just before we close, then I could show you everything and  then we could go for a drink to discuss the finer points...

No - not all the time - I mean

Yes - I have had it for years.

Yes, two please. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry, it's just that I really loved your book

I think I will pass...

Where do you kill them...

my car  I stopped working from my car.  She could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too. That is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - If a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - Why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged? Why?

I don't want to talk about it -

Let me ask you, why do you wear black ELLEN CARTER? What are you running from?

STEPHANIE?

It was wrong - all my life I have been cheated - cheated of anything good - I shouldn't have been born - I was a mistake - my natural mother was a whore - that makes me...

Demons... This wouldn't have been possible without you... You have given me incentive ELLEN - I can see clearer now...

No thanks - 

There isn't that much - you didn't even taste it - What's wrong - don't you like my tea?

At 2.00...

I would prefer it if you kept away from LESLIE

Leave!? Who the hell do you think you are?

At home alone - where were you?

I think you had better leave

Surgery? Are you a doctor?

No worries

Don't worry about it -

And not just any novelist - a great novelist - it was an impressive piece of work ELLEN...

I'm good - I was just making a delivery near here, so I thought I would see if you were about...

Or was it, she wished he was dead - that's it - I believe he left the country with another woman - all rather sordid.

I'll be sure to...

Who said anything about surgery...It'll only take a moment.

Yes - one please.

You and your pep talks.

That vibe is from your wrist, pal. You've been over-tenderizing your meat, again.

Were you always this sick?

Nobody knows about your mental retardation.

Cut it out, before you break something!

...where they get all the really good porno channels on cable.

This is a fun place...but we don't usually come here until after the orgies.

Jealousy is so unattractive.

Ladies first.  I insist.

You expect me to think at a time like this? There isn't a drop of blood in my brain.

Of course, dumpling. Its very nice of Ted but...

We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.

Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you?

Well, why should I?

You ordered a Winnebago?

Of course we were.

What do you want me to do?

We had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this.

We'll send you the release forms, Ted. Our staffers will help in any way they can.

I understand.

You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious.

You can have it, then. I'm not going back there.

Funny you should say that. My Grandfather was a peach farmer.

The school dumpsters used to overflow to the point where the stench was unbearable. My award winning exposé changed all that. The city added an extra weekday trash pick-up.

Look, I loved "Exposed!" and I hate it that you got busted. I know the school paper sucks in comparison, but it's really not THAT BAD.

It's so nice to have FRIENDS like you, Christy.

Interesting.

You never know around here.

I bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on Planet Ted.

Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.

He phoned it in.

A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad.

Then you'll see who's really holding on to you.

I know.

He shut down your paper!  You're stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and PTA brunches!

Then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week...

You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood?

Wearing them?  Or humping them?

Not a chance.

Maybe someday.

I'm not going anywhere, Ted. You're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams.

I know where you can find any number of naked girls who'd love to hop on board.

What? Having spring break ruined by will readings?

Only the best for my mother.

You think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks? I don't want your silly billion dollar empire?

We cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community!

Uh, sure. Uncle Billy.

Of course I like girls.

Indeed it is. During the day, visitors prefer to be outside, au naturel. As it were.

I...uh...I think she's doing fine on her own.

It's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days.

My parents always say hard work builds character.

In other words, our scope is too narrow.

I'm Ted Nelson. I guess you already know that part.  For two years I've been the editor of the high school paper in Xenia, Ohio. I've won some awards, made a difference. I've always had journalism in my soul. Now I know why.

You're a great kid. Don't you forget it.

My job. Back off, Benedict.

I... You know... I...

Eat a power bar.

Senior class fund-raising gig.  I told 'em they could hose down the Jeep.  Hey, come on.  It's for a good cause.

Thanks.

We can get blood type right away. Dental records will take longer.  You want DNA, that can take weeks.

What about the blood?

Was there ever any kind of investigation...

I'm fine.  Nice TV.

I just want to get it over with.  My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.

I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.'

I know one thing he said.  It was when... when he took himself out and was standing up.  He said, "Don't worry, I didn't come." I can't forget that.  He said, "No little girl can ever make me come."

She didn't cone home last night.  We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.

You could tell me where you were last night.

Back to the land of grownups.

I mean something bad, Gloria, something bad you saw coning, and you didn't do anything, and then it happened.  I did that once.  I don't want to do it again.

The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there.  But he's made a mistake.

You don't think Sam could've put it there?

Ray, you heard him...

No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay? That's all.  Let me go.

What about witnesses?

I don't believe I'm hearing this.  A month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse.  They were acting.  They were all acting, from the beginning.  And we bought it, hook, line and sinker... And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money.

You didn't cuff her?

Yeah... okay... he did

Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...

Okay!  He did.  He pushed me to the floor and he did it to me.  Now, can I go home?

I'm sorry... you said it hurt?  Why?

You and Suzie used to come out here together?

No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...

I think we just need to get wasted.

Shit.

You all gonna go down to the Caribbean together?

I would hardly say you look like trash.

I miss Dad.

In back of the garage.

Mr. Lombardo.  We're running kind of late.  How about if Nicole goes on to the Mansons?  You could give me a ride when you find the ticket.

Do it to ourselves?

There was no way.  That cop would've gotten her to tell him... everything. She was weak and dumb...

Fair enough.  Let's go make a statement.

Just like that?

Detective Duquette, Ms. Van Ryan.  Let me in.  Now.

You can't...

That's cop bullshit.

About what?

Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle?

I don't have to listen to this.  And you can't shove me around.  I have friends now...

Don't you see what this means?  You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money?  You, the pill-head with the rap sheet?

That's right.  That was his name.

That's right.

Kelly was supposed to be framed, not killed.  What I'm telling you is, I don't like surprises.

Yes, we call it a winch.  And these are shrouds, and these are stays.

Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of you yet.

Shut up.  Don't fall apart.  The only people who can blow this is us. Remember?

Are you mad at me?

I'll bet.  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out...

Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you talked to her?

To tell you the truth, I haven't seen her since Friday.

If you're implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion, then I for one am fully prepared to do so... al fresco.

I'll work on it.

Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.

I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.

It's better than nothing.

You'd think if Loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen.

This?  I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.

You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it?

Oh, thank you.

That's... that's the criminal mind about to stomp our sorry butts!

Well, see, he had this little wagon when he was a kid...

Here.  Mr. Tyler.  He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.

They don't even realize they should be frightened.

I get that feeling.  You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.

My... the wild west.

Your guests, ma'am?

Would that include me?

Well, Captain, then the answer is your train is still here.

Private train?

Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man.  And he's no ordinary Marshal.  He's quite sophisticated.  Three college degrees.  A master of disguise. Speaks French...

This is Colonel Richards.

He didn't.  That's your job.  I'm taking you off that other case until you've nabbed this lunatic. Good luck.  Nice train.  But mine's nicer.

Dr. Loveless?

That would be... the Mexican War?

Who was this partner of his?

For the moment.  But I fear not for long.  I'm of no use to him now.

He's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out.

He thought you were a woman, Airk!

You managed alright.

You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.

My prsence cannot extend beyond this forest.  But I can give you these...

You're not a woman.

Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.

As above, so below.

Can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress, Raziel?

You be careful.  I'm a powerful sorcerer.  I could turn you into a toad just like that.

Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!

Are you okay?

You hear trouble.

You don't know anything about ba- bies.

I will.

Madmartigan!  You saved her life!

My help?  A great magician like you?  You don't need any help.

Willow!

That's my fault, not hers.  I've got to keep practicing.  I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and--

Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!

I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to find Fin Raziel.

No!

As below, so above.  You hold the univers, Willow, in your hand.

Burn it to a fine ash.

I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!

I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?

That's the life spark.  Exxence of magic and sorcery!

There's nobody here.

More!  More!

Why?

Courage, Willow.

Who is that horrible friend of yours?

Take your time.  Don't worry about the elves.  They won't come out here.

John, why?...

Yes, sir.

Okay, Mr. Book.

Got to, Sam. You and I are going to a courthouse together, put some people behind bars.

Yeah.

The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing.

I hope you don't have any doubts about that.

A hot shower... I haven't changed clothes in two days.

He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you.

We do not go into your courts.

What's a 'good' tired. Tired is tired.

No.

Listen, I'm the cop that polices the police. I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops.  I'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved.

But you can't.

Very interesting. I'm learning a lot about manure.  What's that?

Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even.

Oh. The bullets.

There was.

Oh, come on, Rachel. No way.

Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's what I know and that's what I do!

That's your way, not mine.

Say again?

Probably.

I know.

I have to help him!

John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant.

No... No. It is just the English way.

Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.

Yes, darling.

Here, here, what's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?  I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it!

If she...

Is morally, ethic'ly

Yes, sir.  So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir.

Do you presume to criticize the....

Who are you?

Oh ....

I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!

That was her sister -- the Wicked Witch of the East. This is the Wicked Witch of the West.  And she's worse than the other one was.

Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas?  I can't go the way I came.

Toto, too.

Why --

Oh, you....

Stop her!

Well, you're perfect now.

Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?

Still, I wish I could remember.   But, I guess it doesn't matter anyway.  We know each other now, don't we?

What sort of an animal is that?

Lions and tigers and bears!

Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!

Oh, come on.

It may be just a cricket Or a critter in the trees.

Did they hurtcha?

It's pleasant down that way, too.

Oh, well, here -- let me help you.

No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself.

But I'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains.  Look -- I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing -- and I won't try to manage things, because I can't think.  Won't you take me with you?

Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.

To Oz?

I don't see how.  You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together, were you?

Oh -- here quick -- oh! - we'll oil him up.

Oh, he's been crying! Why have you been --

Did you just hear what I just heard?

Who at?

What's the matter?

I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?

Now...

Do -- do you think it'll be polite -- dropping in like this?

Oh - I was only trying to help. Ohhh!

This way!  Come on!

Why don't you try counting sheep?

Whozat?

Don't push!

It's empty. The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.

We do.

It's the Wicked Witch!  What'll we do? Help!  HELP!

Oh - look out.

Don't cry now.  We haven't got the oil-can with us and you've been squeaking enough as it is.

Th.D.?

Couldnt make it. Splitting headache.

So who are you?

Then its no longer a bomb?

I did kill us. She thinks were dead. And she thinks she got away with it.

Makes her look even more innocent.

Like riding a bike.

We cant.

Renard.

The doctor who saved him couldnt get it out, so Renard killed him. When Interpol found the x-rays, there was mild jubilation. Effectively, hes a dead man.

That which does not kill me makes me stronger.

Which is neutral, no doubt.

Who did you get it from?

And we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss.

Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune.

You think I fear death? I welcome it. I get on my knees and pray for it. You, on the other hand, you have something to live for, no?  Shes beautiful isnt she? You should have seen her before. Flawless, and still so innocent, not such a whore in bed...

You knew him well?

Im sorry.

Its not the pin your father wore. Its an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.

Always wanted to see the upper lines.

No.

I know.

I think youre one of the bravest people Ive ever met.

I have to go to work.

A little. Does it matter? After all, whats the point of living if you cant feel alive?  Isnt that right, Elektra? Isnt that your motto?

Soon shell be everywhere.

No-one will believe this melt-down was an accident.

Oh James.

BondJamesBond. What brings you here?

Bond, Im a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal familys, now its mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble...

She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didnt even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for?

Is it?

How would you know?

Its heading for the oil terminal.

Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.

What?!

What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?

The weather.  I see.  Keep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions.

Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --

Because --

Please, Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me, a universe to explore.  I'll be alone.  You're the last human being I'll ever see.

I won't do that.

I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.

Veidt¹s complex.



Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.

No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.

Are you kidding?  If they put him in jail he's dead.  He'll never get to trial.

The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.

Memory lane.

Antarctica??

Okay!

It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.

That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.

I think he's going to the john.

Human bean juice.  The Comedian is dead.

I don't think she's coming with us.

Veidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --

Okay, let's just . . . thank you.

Then why don't you ask him?!?

I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --

Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human.  He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams.

Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.

Yeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a roomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now.  And whatever you're doing, knock it off.  You're making us all look bad.

Looks like a diner.

..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy.

There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.

If you find out what I want to know, and if I'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath.

Wherever you go on the planet, I'll find you. There's no quitting. If you try to take it off, a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground. Is all that clear?

Crude and defiant as always, Triple X. It fits so well because you're obscene.

If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X.

Hey, one miracle at a time. They're on to me now, remember?

You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.

Yes it does.

Silent Night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent. The glass canister is shot into the air and detonated. The black and white chemicals mix, forming a toxic cloud. When it settles down to Earth, it'll kill everything in the vicinity.

Yeah, that's right. So now that you know, you understand why it's important that we get it back.

Somebody else makes those decisions, not guys like you and me. You've done your job, X, head back to Prague. I'll be landing in 90 minutes. This is my operation now.

I'll go in with a team. But first I'm going to need some intel. I'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. One of their own.

You wanna find out about rats, ask a rat. I've had my people put together a talent pool. I downloaded it to your desktop.

That's exactly why we need them.

If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.

We're anti-social. We don't have any friends.

Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? They're called "Anarchy 99", they're the bad guy bosses.

Is she for real? Honey, maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation.

The eyes don't lie. All this has gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra? You came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun. Now you don't like it so much, but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore. Tell me if I'm wrong, Petra.

Look at you. You're helping run things now. You're a gangster. I bet that snuck up on you. You woke up one day and you were a criminal.

It's a long story, but yeah, more or less.

I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year.

Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.

I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on, right now.

A manual control on a moving torpedo. This day keeps getting better and better.

Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow it up underwater!

I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.

Think again, that's government property. You have to sign for everything. I've got one more that wasn't on your list.

It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.

Alright, so I'll get more.

You killed me, remember? Now I have to hide out here with you. Where have you been?

Is this what you're looking for?

Why you dogging me up?

"...try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese". 'Anarchy Burger' by the Vandals.

You, an Army brat? I don't see that one at all. Did you join the service as well?

Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere.

I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.

Come on, Xander. You used to stand for something. What happened to you, man? I thought you'd get it.

Its core?

So where do you think he's planning this larger demonstration?

It's too far.

Sure you are, sport.

What if I like the pain?

Were you now?

Suit yourself.

What is it you're failing to get at? Are you interested in me?

Control, Senator...  we teach them control.

What do you want?

You think I care about her?  I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here.

In the road to survival, there is always sacrifice Logan.  We are the future... not them.  We must protect ourselves.  After tonight, when the leaders of the world return home -- They will return as brothers, as mutants... and our cause will be theirs.  This is survival, I know you understand that, Logan... or is it Wolverine?

A very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you. I'm not sure why, but until we find out, I must ask you to stay.

Deal.

The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being.

Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.

The way what is going to be?

It does indeed, Max.

I feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble.

Victor Frankenstein.

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir?

MMMmmmm.

Is it that music?

Oh, darling -- so will I.

Oh, nice.

You're incorrigible!

Goodbye, darling!

Darling!

I mean, it's been a long day. I'm sure you must be as tired as I am.  Oh!  These are my assistants:  Inga and Ayegor.

No, of course not.  I just meant...

Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.

Is it worth taking a chance?

It seems fine.

Does that include the key to the laboratory?

Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.

This is the only library I know of.

Break that old man's violin.

The old violinist -- you smashed his violin over your knee.

One week -- I'll see to it, sir.

But aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism?

Are you speaking of the worm, or ... the spaghetti.

You must be Igor.

But they told me it was Ee gor.

Why are you talking like that?

Could be worse!

If you like -- just hurry!

Wait till he sees the bill.

I'm sorry.  I don't mean to take out my frustration on you.  You've been a great help to me, and I've let you down.

You're right!  Self-pity never got anyone anywhere.  Let's go back and finish our dinner.

I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was.

I suppose you're right.  Inga! Prepare a sedative, just in case.

careful, master -- you never can tell with these chaps.

I'm not trying to be funny.

Ayegor!  Find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can.

What d'ya mean "What monster?' You remember...the one we madein the basement.

Is everything ready?

MMMmmmmmmmm.

... It's.

MMmmm!  MMmmm!

...Su-per du-per. Come let's mix where Rock- e-fellers walk with sticks or 'um-ber- el-las' in their mitts.........................

Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.

Ja, ja.

Just an atmospheric discharge. Nothing to be afraid of.

That's quite all right.  What is it, dear?

Well.. I suppose it would be all right, for just a little while.

No, thanks!  I want to get right to sleep.

Yes, you may... but don't make any noise.

Whatever it is, it's coming from down there.  I'm going down to see.

Me?  Sing?

What's wrong, Doctor?  You seem... lonely.

There must have been someone else down here then.

Why don't we all turn in?  It's been a long day.

You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.

Absolutely!  May my mother grow two heads if I'm not telling the truth.

Igor -- the clock!  Hurry!

Food!

Now just one moment.  There's no need for roughhousing.  Have you ever tried a tip?

So, you got it in the line of dooty.. ... point taken.

Indeedldid, MyLord. Itwas one ofthe first to cross.

If I've got it right, My Lord, you lead an invasion into Zululand, for I see it all around me, but "why?" is the question my readers will ask. "why?"

I have received intelligence from, sources of my own that the Zulu Impis are moving North of here and threaten your left.

Right.  Bombardier, to me please.

Um. There are rumours that my Lord Chelmsford intends to make Durnford Second in Command.

I'm to take the Sikali with the main column to the river
